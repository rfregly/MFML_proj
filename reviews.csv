0,5.0,"I've got to hand it to Liane Moriarty. Just when I think I've seen it all, she comes along and completely surprises me with this sparkling and startling gem of a tale.Joy Delaney, beloved wife and mother of four, has disappeared. Her adult children are rightfully aghast, but they're reluctant to report her missing. Because they know the prime suspect will be their father, and they're not really sure of his innocence. When the police start asking questions, it quickly becomes clear everyone in the family has stories to tell and secrets to hide. And before it's all over, everything will be revealed and laid bare.I've really been enjoying stories about dysfunctional families lately, and this is such a superb one. The four siblings are all trying to figure out if their father could've really murdered their mother, and if so, which side would they be on? It's a fascinating premise, and the progression of the story captures all of the nuanced facets that this dilemma would bring to the family.What I've always admired about Moriarty's writing is her sharp and astute observations of people and their flaws. She has this ability to peel back the layers of family relationships and what it means to be human, and to expose everything ugly and beautiful within, while injecting just that right dose of humor. This book hits upon tender subjects that everyone would recognize as familiar, yet instead of making me cry, it made me laugh.Needless to say, I found this whole thing to be utterly riveting and unputdownable. The characters are memorable, the strife feels all too real, and the dialogue is snappy. I devoured it in just a few days. While the mystery isn't the core of this book, there were still plenty of revelations along the way that kept me surprised and delighted.Liane Moriarty is back! This seemingly simple tale of dysfunctional families and relationships, of people's flaws and the messiness of their lives, of unmet expectations and unspoken dreams, hit all the right notes for me. It feels like Moriarty's last two books have been a little bit off of her true form. But with this one, she again returns to the pinnacle of her craft.My heartfelt thanks for the advance copy that was provided for my honest and unbiased review."
1,2.0,"2.5 STARS / I was going to give it a 3, but the end ruined itMehRead 467 pages and also listened to much of it...*Length: 18 hrs and 3 mins*Unabridged Audiobook*Narrated by: Caroline LeeThis was a long time to invest in characters and a story. What started as a mystery of a missing mother became a bit of a slog with lots of repetition, dialogue and nothing happening (tennis references, migraines, anxiety, food, more tennis). There were a few moments of humor, but not enough to make this one very enjoyable. The entire storyline was anticlimatic and unconvincing. I kept waiting for everything to make sense, it didn't (how can these smart people be so foolish)? I kept waiting for some kind of revelation (not worth it). I kept waiting for the explosive ending, never happened (You want me to believe that happened?). I won't even go into the COVID chapter (what was that)? I don't mind slow burns if the story holds my interest, but this one became frustrating and was definitely overwritten. I missed the fun and craziness her books usually deliver. It was just okay, I didn't love it. Oh well.....moving on.....Audible credit/ Library loan/ Read in October 2021"
2,5.0,"Do you like apples? Well I got my favorite author back. How do you like them apples? My relationship with Liane Moriarty has felt a little one-sided in recent years. I became smitten with her when I read The Husband’s Secret but really fell hard for Big Little Lies. I went back and read most of her previous catalog but then… Truly Madly Guilty and Nine Perfect Strangers. (AKA Truly Madly OMG-pleasestopsayingatthebarbecue and Nine Perfect WTH-isthisactuallyhappeningamIondrugs.)I really needed a winner from my dear Liane or I was going to have to consider a breakup, and I’m over the moon that she delivered. Apples Never Fall follows the tennis-obsessed Delaney family, which includes two recently-retired parents and their four adult children. Matriarch Joy has gone missing, so there is an intriguing “what happened to mum?” plot to keep the pages turning. The thing that Liane Moriarty absolutely excels at is characterization. She must be the most keen observer of the human condition, because she nails insightful - and accurate - idiosyncrasies that make each of her fictional creations feel truly real. Fair warning though that there is a lot of tennis in this book. A LOT. You don’t have to like tennis to like the book, but if you love it… you’ll love it. And because you know I can't resist a little wordplay, I’ll end with this: Liane Moriarty is back in form and serving aces once again. Blog: https://www.confettibookshelf.com/"
3,1.0,"The real tragedy here? I will never get the hours and hours back that I wasted reading this. I’m a DNF Queen but I kept listening when I hated everything about it. I’ve seen the glowing reviews and knew it would SURELY get better if I just listened a little longer.Tedious, plodding, boring, and pointless. Plus, at 467 pages, it was at least 150 pages too long. I typically love slow-burn character studies as well as dysfunctional families, but not this time. When I finally waded through nearly the entire book to find out the resolution to the ""riveting"" mystery of what happened to Joy and who the mystery girl was, the book firmly sealed its fate as the worst book I have read this year. The ending made the book WORSE, not better. The turd on top of this steaming pile was a stupid pandemic chapter.Because I like to find at least one positive thing about a book, I will say there were flashes of humor that I enjoyed but they were too few and far between to make it worth slogging through such a long book. My time would have been better spent watching paint dry."
4,3.0,"Liane Moriarty's latest offering is an Aussie family drama featuring the renowned tennis obsessed Delaney family, the tall, handsome Stan, tennis coach extraordinaire, and his wife, Joy, the force behind their tennis business. They have 4 adult children, the unable to settle and plagued with mental health issues, Amy, the solid, reliable, handyman and business communications teacher, Logan, the slick wealthy divorced trader, Troy, and the migraine troubled physiotherapist, Brooke, struggling to make ends meet with her business. Joy and Stan have retired, having sold their tennis business, but retirement does not sit well with a couple who have led such active and busy lives, their long and happy marriage of 50 years is beginning to show signs of strain. The 69 year old Joy is desperately repressing her resentments and desire for grandchildren, placing her hopes on Logan and his partner, Indira, and Brooke's 10 year marriage to Grant, in expectation of them having a child soon. The only problem is that Indira has left Logan, and Grant has separated from Brooke, and neither Logan nor Brooke are keen on sharing this news with their parents. The story begins with the adult children discussing their missing mother, Joy had sent them all a text saying she was going off grid for a while. The only thing is that it is so unlike their mother to go off on her own, she left no note behind, and their father's face has what looks to be nail scratches, all of which has them worried, should they report Joy missing to the police? The narrative goes back and forth from the previous September and the present, the arrival of a strange woman, Savannah, turning up on Joy and Stan's doorstep, claiming to have been abused by her boyfriend. She is welcomed by Joy and Stan, taking up residence with them, but who exactly is she?There are many aspects of this novel that I enjoyed, particularly the complicated relationships between the adult Delaney siblings and their relationship with tennis, and the closer examination of Stan and Joy's perfect marriage and the flaws that come to be exposed, all of which lead the police to believe that Stan may be guilty of murder. I have loved all the Liane Moriarty books I have read previously, but I struggled with this one more, all the pieces were there, but the overlong story and the characters she created didn't capture my interest as much. I missed the bizarre and offbeat touches and the magical spark that usually lift her novels failed to ignite for me. What spurred me on to complete the novel was that I wanted to know what happened to Joy and to discover the truth behind the sudden appearance of Savannah in the Delaney family. I am sure there will be many readers who will love this more than me, so do please check other reviews of this book. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC."
5,3.0,"Jokes 5/5, Storytelling 2/5, Editing 1/5Stan and Joy have been married FOREVER and have recently retired from their Tennis School. As boredom sets in, they hear a knock on the door late one night. A mysterious girl is on their porch. Then, Joy goes missing. What happened to Joy? Is she alive or dead? And who is responsible?This book was quite funny; however, it was really, really long. Additionally, as a mystery, it could have been formatted in a much more compelling way. There was so much backstory on this that I even forgot that Joy was missing for a good portion of the book. Applies Never Fall tried to touch on way too many things all at once: the pandemic, all different kinds of relationships, Troy's views, Polly Perkins, migraines, depression, and more. It tried to cover everything and the kitchen sink. Truthfully, I would have enjoyed this book more if it was edited down to half of its length.Overall, a book which is funny at times but too long."
6,4.0,"Apples Never Fall by Liane Moriarty (Author), Caroline Lee (Narrator)This story looked so interesting but several of my friends started and didn't finish the book so I was apprehensive about giving the audiobook a try because it comes in at 18 hours at normal speed. I always finish a book so I'd be in for a long slog if I didn't like it. The not finishing a book is why I'm very careful about the books I accept or check out from the library. Once I started the audiobook, I wondered if I could stand so much of Joy yakking out loud and in her head while her husband, Stan, did his silent, surly thing. And the narrator's voice could be so squeaky at times, or a lot, actually, And then, Savannah showed up and silly Joy and Stan let her in and allow her to just STAY!?!?!? (My inner voice just squeaked on the word stay, now that I have the narrator stuck in my head). I became hooked on the story but also fell in love with the narration. It was so dramatic and sometimes silly and I adored it. We get to be there in everybody's head and also we get to eavesdrop on all the gossip and guessing about what is going on and what has gone on in the past. People thinking things that you'd never say out loud although they sometimes do say them out loud and it was so funny. Yes, yes, I felt bad for laughing when sixty nine year old Joy is missing and she might have been murdered by grumpy old seventy year old Stan. We get the story in two timelines, ""now"" and ""specific times in the past six months"". We get to know Joy and Stan's four adult children, all adversely affected by their parents relationship and their dedication to the sport of tennis. But the damage didn't start with Joy and Stan, they each had their rough upbringings that affected the way the reacted to the world around them and the expectations they had for themselves and their children. The story and the situations are very serious but still, life, what we think about life, and what we think about ourselves and others, can be funny and Caroline Lee did such a good job with her dramatic narration. I began to love every single squeak. I do wish I had some answers. At the end, as the author figuratively walks away from the book, there I was in the back of the room, waving my arms wildly, trying to get her attention because I had questions! I want to know things! But shucks, I didn't get the answers to my questions so I'm going to pout a little bit. I slept on this story because I finished it so late at night and woke up liking it even more this morning.Published September 14, 2021 by Macmillan Audio"
7,5.0,"Liane Moriarty does it again! Joy Delaney has gone missing under mysterious circumstances. She’s left a cryptic message for her four children. And Stan, her husband, is acting very weird. The four children are loath to notify the police, because won’t suspicion fall on their dad? What does it say about the family that that’s the first thing they worry about?We hear from Joy, 69 years old, recently retired after selling their tennis academy, six months before she vanishes. Because out of the blue, a young woman arrives on their doorstep one night, after a fight with her boyfriend. I just loved the snarky humor of this story. The way Moriarty uses various people overhearing conversations between the siblings to move the story forward is just pitch perfect. The book really gripped me from the get go. We learn that each of the family members has their own secrets. I totally got the family dynamics, about who has to be called in what order, whose nose gets bent out of shape over what, who has what role. It just all rang true. But the book has a lot of depth to it as well. It has so much to say about how we perceive things, about choices made, about what we give up for others. While she’s a minor character, I adored Christina, the detective assigned to investigate Joy’s disappearance. There’s a bit about why her own parents divorced that had me laughing out loud and reading it to my husband (who was smart enough to understand). As the book progresses, the twists start to come fast and furious. I was constantly caught off guard, as I hadn’t anticipated most of them. This is truly a story for which Chekhov’s theory about a gun in act one being used in act two holds particularly true. Everything is tied up nicely here. And I sure didn’t anticipate that ending. One of those endings that just has you going what the h***…Like all of Moriarty’s works, this begs to be made into a mini-series. It’s got it all, the perfect mix of drama and humor, the fully formed characters, a story that has multiple layers. I received this book as a Goodreads giveaway. My thanks to the publisher, Henry Holt and Company."
8,5.0,"The Australian writer, Liane Moriarty, captured the family dynamics how we love and hurt the people closest to us. With complex relationships, flawed personalities, secrets, sibling rivalries and mainly regrets, we are harvested into this household through decades of their mistakes and failures. What could-have-been, what should-have-been and what is, reveals to us each decision they made had an outcome on their life. Brilliantly written with the best uncanny, snarky humor residing in every chapter, I could not stop until the last minute played, as I listened to Caroline Lee read the best rendition of these characters, I hung onto every word and character's life as if they were my neighbors and I was across the white picket fence eavesdropping. These characters are truly embodied into people we have probably grown up with. I can't wait to see this as a Netflix series and who would be typecast. The family finds themselves in a dilemma when the mother has ""gone off grid"" per her text to her adult children. Suspiciously, her phone is found underneath the bed, her bicycle is missing and her glasses found on the table. The opening chapter are the siblings discussing her mysterious disappearance at a local restaurant and whether the father is to blame. The waitress eavesdropping is just one of the many characters sprinkled throughout given insight to their opinion. ""Apples never fall too far from the tree."" Apples for an apple crumble pie...4 apples in the bicycle missing...4 children for every apple...🤔With 4 children all different personalities but unable to maintain a relationship, Amy, Logan, Troy and Brooke share their idea, thoughts and views of growing up in their home and how their dad is capable of such a crime. Dad has scratches on his face and differs on the mention to call the police and report her missing. With the catalyst of clues, it is sure to be their father...don't they always look at the husband first as a suspect?Missing is the mother, Joy Delaney, 69 years old, who delivers a whimsical, ""overly"" helpful, June Cleaver image and ""stay at home"" parent who can be heard as the woman in the Geico commercial calling her son with a conversation about the squirrels in the attic while he fights off bad guys...gets me every time..clueless to what is outside her home, but don't let her fool you. She has secrets of her own. The father, Stan Delaney, a retired outstanding tennis coach developed a tennis empire with his wife and clearly has an obsession for talent... driving his children outside their realm of normalcy. His deadpan character displays gnomic and sarcastic canter that he constantly brings to center front with bitterness, his one time tennis pro student Harry Haddad. The children loathed hearing his name when they were compared to his strength in tennis to their own weaknesses. He reminded them quite often none of them had talent, causing a fury of resentment and instability in their lives.Then there is a stand alone character, Savannah, a stranger to them showing up on their doorstep beaten and bruised by an abusive boyfriend. The house was picked randomingly or was it? She becomes a mainstay earning her right to live with them cooking and cleaning while spending their money. The children soon become envious of her ease into their parents life and begin an investigation of their own before their mother disappeared. Savannah has disappeared too...The story not only develops what happened a year ago with transfers of present time, but gives you a lifetime of their experiences.The ending wasn't perfect, but how do I say it was perfectly woven in? I saw the side of COVID most of us were thinking, but told through the eyes of a clueless Joy. I laughed throughout this story, but on edge for the truth and baring my own soul in the process...We are a delightfully weird species put into perspective by this awesome author. Thanks NetGalley and Macmillan Audio for this incredible ARC in exchange for my honest opinion and review."
9,3.0,"This was good I guess? I think I would have rated it higher if it wasn't for the ending. The explanation of the whole ""what happened to Joy"" thing was just stupid. And then the author decided we all needed to be reminded about the pandemic and that gets suddenly included at the end and I'm actually still kind of mad about that. If it had made sense to include it, like it was an integral part of the plot, I could have been ok with it, but this was just in there for no seemingly no rhyme or reason. Especially since I felt the book should have already ended before that point considering the mystery was already solved. So yeah, those two things made me drop this down to three stars."
10,4.0,"I was thrilled to be approved for an advance listening copy of this book, and also excited to see that the narrator was Caroline Lee, who narrated the other Liane Moriarty books I've listened to previously. She gives the perfect voices to the entire Australian Delaney family and kept me completely invested in the story.This is a sweeping family saga featuring Joy and Stan, who have been married for fifty years and have four adult children--Amy, Brooke, Troy, and Logan. The family's ""claim to fame"" is that they have all been competitive tennis players in the past and Stan and Joy ran a tennis school and coached. One day, Joy turns up missing and suspicion turns to Stan. Even the children wonder if he might be guilty. The tale is told from two main directions--in the past leading up to Joy going missing and the present-day going forward with the investigation into her whereabouts. A mysterious visitor named Savannah factors in heavily. Sprinkled throughout are moments from the distant past and the shaping of the Delaney family's lives.I adore family sagas and this one absolutely did not disappoint. I don't have any knowledge or interest in tennis, but that doesn't matter at all. It's more the story of what has happened within their family and each of the siblings' lives. The characters are so well-drawn and full of life that I will honestly miss them--faults (ha tennis joke) and all--now that I'm finished with the book. Readers get a real sense of each of the Delaneys and Savannah and can both sympathize and empathize with them as various things are revealed. There is humor throughout the story and Joy often reminded me of my mother-in-law with her stream of consciousness talking, and yet she also reminded me of myself and the things women take on as wives and mothers that we would never expect men to take on. The mystery of what happened to Joy compelled me to keep going to discover the answer, but overall the answer isn't as important as the journey to get there. I also loved the portrayal of a 50 year marriage with its ups and downs and even the mundane middle ground. The ending of this book was a bit of a jaw-dropper because I was absolutely not expecting it, and yet it seemed so perfect to give closure to everything that happened. Moriarty's books are unique and this one is no exception. It's a much more straightforward story than her last book (Nine Perfect Strangers) and I'm so glad for that. The combination of family drama with mystery, sprinkled with humor and touching moments is a winner.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own. "
11,4.0,"The Delaney family saga’s entire story truly matches with proverbial saying: apple never falls from the tree!  This is well written, interesting reading written by one of my all time favorite author’s dry and dark sense of witty humor ! There’s big mystery about a mother’s abrupt, sudden disappearance but as the story moves back and forth between past and present with multi POVs of Delaney members: we realize how their decisions, choices, misdemeanors, regrets, secrets in the past shaped their future : the author perfectly reflected the connection between last fall when a young named Savannah suddenly appeared at their parents’ house door and the progression of Joy Delaney’s sudden disappearance. What’s the main connection with two incidents? How children cope with the their mother’s disappearance? As two of them think their father must be involved with this incident ( including police officers because there are scratch marks on Stan’s face and everything he tells about how his wife got missing seems like a big lie) and two of them still thinks he’s innocent! I wanted to give you more information about the family’s background story so you can visualize a clear picture on your mind ( or maybe you start match actors with characters because I’m so sure we’re gonna see this book’s adaptation into the series just like the other scandalously delicious work of the author and interestingly ! By the way I couldn’t help myself so as a part of occupation, I already made a cast for the book ( or its possible future adaptation and of course I only thought brilliant Aussie actors) I thought Rose Bryne as Brooke and Rebel Wilson as Amy, Jai Courtney as Troy and Ryan Kwanten as Logan and here’s my Aussie couple suggestion : Joy must be played by Jacki Weaver and my ideal Stan candidate is John Noble! Oh, Savannah could be played by Margot Robbie ( even though I got sick of seeing her face at 10 different movies lately. ) Okay, let’s get back to the story;Delaneys always attract the attention of the community with their enormous heights and their obsession with tennis! Joy and Stan married for fifty years, ran a tennis school for a long time to coach adult children and raise future tennis stars! They also pushed their four children to become future tennis stars but unfortunately none of them pursued a career by following their parents’ footsteps even though they were talented enough and the obvious rivalry between them pushed their limits but at the end : their life didn’t turn into something they’ve dreamt of. And now they still hide so many secrets, dealing with their own insecurities.  Joy and Stan finally sells their tennis house but without reflecting their all energy to the business, they feel lost. Then a perfect stranger named Savannah who seems shaken, beaten knocks their door, needing help to spend the night away from abusing boyfriend. So the couple ( at least Joy) welcomes her with open arms. As the time passes, Savannah becomes a member of the house and four children of Delaneys five different reactions to the forced addition to their family.  The four children already deal with different problems. Eldest one Amy shows signs of suffering from bipolar: in her early forties she doesn’t have regular job, living with roommates ( mostly returns back to her parents’ house) , no boyfriend, no particular dream for life, trying too hard to look tough. Brooke with e is also about to lose her physiotherapy place she’s invested, taking break from longtime boyfriend, trying too hard to look as the most mature one but she struggles because of her insecurities. Logan also has regrets about not accepting the tennis scholarships in Chicago which could have changed his entire life but now his girlfriend left him and he’s not so full filled with his teaching job at community college and Troy also acts like superior as he feels more inferior, struggling with his job!  None of them happy and none of them has any intention to share those secrets with each other!  Overall: I loved the interception of past and present time events and I loved the contribution of random people’s POVs to the story ( waitress who try to get orders from siblings, gossiping customers at hair dresser, noisy taxi driver etc.) and that WTH ending was truly unexpected! This is not my most favorite book of the author but it is still so enjoyable. Her dry humor and fantastic storytelling skills gave us enough reason to get hooked up by Delaney family saga from the beginning!Looking forward to read next works of the author! ( probably we will see this book’s adaptation on streaming services)"
12,4.0,"Another excellent novel from this talented Australian author. She really knows how to delve into relationships, and expose all the secrets between families and friends. At the same time she writes a good story which keeps the reader engaged and hanging out for each new page to see what happens next.Apples Never Fall is a family saga centering around the Delaney family. Joy and Stan, the parents, are still married after fifty years, and are still playing up a storm on the tennis court at 69 and 70. Their four children Amy, Brooke, Troy and Logan, are all adults who have a bit of growing up still to do. There are a lot of childhood grievances hanging around and affecting their relationships and lives.Things come to a head when a family member disappears, another is suspected of murder and the others begin to take sides. It is a well designed mystery plot which continues throughout the book and kept me turning the pages until very late at night. There is a surprise ending which rounds everything up beautifully.I only had one criticism - the book does not stop at what was for me the obvious high point. It meanders along for several more chapters, like an epilogue, telling me all sorts of things which were nice to know but meant the book wound down to a stop instead stopping at the crescendo. Sometimes I think not everything needs to be explained. It's a small point though and lots of people probably will like the added details. Altogether this is an excellent book and just as enjoyable as all her others.Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read and review this book."
13,4.0,"Moriarty is back with “Apples Never Fall”. I think this is one of her better works. What makes her special is her witty everyday observations: “He had bushy old-man eyebrows and good, honest, taxpaying eyes.” “Stan Delaney was not the sort of man to sit in a gutter. Her was far too tall.” “The words were not startling, but it felt somehow as if they were witnessing a startlingly  intimate conversation.”Open any page and you will find Moriarty at her height of her career. She is a master of wordcraft. As the story opens four adult siblings are at a café puzzling over their missing mother. They all received a curious text from her stating that she’s going off the grid for a while. Yet, no further explanation is provided. Plus, the text itself is questionable. It seems as though auto-correct might have blurred the information. Similar to previous works, Moriarty tells the tale in two timelines. She begins with the missing mother and then jumps to where it all began. And that would be the last September when a mysterious woman just knocks on their parent’s door, stating that she’s a victim of domestic abuse. The Delaneys (the parents) are winding down for the night when this woman, Savannah (or is that her real name?) infiltrates their lives. From the start, it seemed that there was something fishy about Savannah and her story, yet the Delaney parents are fully charmed by their new boarder. Of course, Savannah works diligently in the Delaney household, creating beautiful dinners, thoughtful cinnamon toast, and minestrone soup. The parents are awed and in love. Of course they create room in their empty-nest home. From the start, the children found Savannah suspect. There is unease with this woman staying with their elderly parents…just out of the blue! The difficulty though is that Savannah brings them such happiness.The Delaney’s have just sold their tennis academy, so both are struggling to find purpose. Joy, the wife, wants to be a grandmother. Stan, the father, is obsessed with a former student who is making a comeback in tennis and writing a memoir. This student quit the Delaney academy right before he rose to Grand Slam fame. Stan never got over Harry’s betrayal of leaving Stan for another coach. Because of their retirement from tennis, there is a bit of idle time finding the elder Delaneys. They are in a rut and primed for an astute interloper.Once Joy goes missing, Stan looks mighty guilty. Through the tossing back and forth between timelines, the reader learns of Stan and Joy’s marriage, and their partnership in the academy. We learn about the four Delaney children, both past and present failures and successes. We learn of Joy’s concern for her children, Stan’s total consumption with the game of tennis. Moriarty superbly brings each character to vivid life. And she creates such a story with some red herrings and deflections that forces the reader to be on their toes. With Moriarty, subtle clues are peppered throughout the story. Moriarty also adds a few extraneous characters who may or may not be a part of the mystery. Each character does provide something to the story, whether that character holds a tiny piece of the mystery answer, or, the character adds dimension and humor. There are layers of family drama. All characters are more than they initially seem.My only criticism is that it is a bit too long. The last 30-40 pages could have been whittled down. Yet, I still fully endorse this story. Her insights into family dynamics and the complexities of the years of relationships makes her stories relatable. I found Joy’s inner thoughts and feelings a treat to read because it is all so real. As a wife and mother, Joy resonated with me."
14,4.0,"Apples Never Fall by Lianne Moriarty is a 2021 Henry Holt and Co. Publication. This one had my name on it! The Delaney family was destined to be a tennis dynasty of sorts. Joy and Stan ran a tennis school, but while all their children played tennis, none of them made it into the pros...The children are all grown now, with various occupations, and riddled with various life challenges, but everything comes to a crashing halt when Joy goes missing. Switching back and forth in time, we learn that once Joy is left with an empty nest, a chance encounter with a troubled young woman named Savannah, morphs into a full-fledged bond for Joy, bordering on a mother/daughter type relationship between the women. We also learn of Stan’s massive career disappointments, mainly being dropped as the coach for a student who went on to massive success in the tennis world. Each of the Delaney children are given a voice, and each is as different as night and day, except that each harbors resentments, disappointments, and suffer from relationship woes. Each responds differently to their mother’s sudden disappearance. We also get an up close and personal glimpse inside Joy and Stan’s marriage. To anyone who knows them, the couple is the epitome of a perfect marriage- on and off the tennis court. Of course, everything is not always as it seems… I really liked this book and for anyone who knows me, that will come as no surprise. I’m always up for a good family saga and it’s even better if there’s a mystery involved in there somewhere, too. The story, for those who are looking primarily for a thriller, goes much deeper than what is on the surface. Joy’s disappearance is a catalyst for the Delaney’s, as memories surface cataloguing the many familial resentments, misunderstanding, and secrets - past and present - that bubble up to the surface.The mystery, the ‘gotcha’ moment, which sort of made me laugh, since I already had my suspicions, might be too much for some- and I get that- but the mystery, in my opinion, was mainly a means to an end. At the heart of the story is the character study of a family, and life. Moriarty nails family and human dynamics- even if our lives are nothing like the Delaney’s, there’s recognition in there, all the same. While the criminal element is quirky, and perhaps the weakest link in the story, overall, I think the author is going for something deeper here. I thought the story was brilliant- smart, clever, thought provoking and entertaining. 4 stars"
15,1.0,"This was horribly dull and frankly ridiculous! 🙄 Too long, too many unbelievable moments, too many phone pick ups(650 is my estimate), but a great story to nap/sleep! 🤦‍♀️to. "
16,3.0,"3.5★“She would say, Here is one possible motive and here is another, because any marriage of that many years has multiple motives for murder. Every police officer and hairdresser knows that.”There used to be an ad for hair colouring that said “only her hairdresser knows for sure”. Well, this is what Joy’s hairdresser said after Joy went missing. Moriarty is great at putting together an ensemble of players with identifiable voices and characteristics. The Delaneys are a family of six, parents Joy and Stan with their two sons and two daughters, all independent adults. The parents met playing tennis and have only just retired from their successful tennis coaching business. The kids played at different levels, and if you’re a tennis fan, you’ll probably appreciate the background.Another character, Savannah, is introduced early in the piece, and she is something else again. She arrives on a rainy night, out of the blue, knocks on the senior Delaneys’ front door, and with an empty nest, Joy welcomes her in. Joy has been worried about her memory and wonders if she's supposed to know this girl and has forgotten her.“She was only familiar in the way everyone seemed familiar these days. They’d just let a stranger into the house. She checked for signs of criminal tendencies and found none, although she wasn’t exactly sure how those tendencies would manifest themselves. The nose stud was really quite pretty.”Joy dives right in, cleans her up with a special bubble bath, finds some of Amy’s old clothes for her, and settles her in “Amy’s” room. “Amy, their eldest, their ‘free spirit’ as Joy liked to call her, their ‘problem child’ as Stan liked to call her, was turning forty next year, and she hadn’t officially lived at home for two decades, but she still used her old bedroom as a kind of permanent storage unit, because she never seemed to settle at one address long enough to properly relocate her possessions.”Amy also has blue hair and lives in a share house. Sister Brooke is a physiotherapist who goes to sports days secretly hoping for injured players she can recruit for treatment. Their brothers, Troy (financially successful trader in NYC) and Logan (fit, always employed locally), gather together with their sisters to try to figure out where their mother has gone. And who is this Savannah person who seems to have been living with their parents, doing all the cooking? The parents obviously loved having her there for a long time, but she's gone, too. We hear about Amy’s alternative lifestyle, Brooke’s migraines (and physio work), Troy’s expensive tastes and flashy cars and life in New York, and a bit about Logan’s rather quiet life in their hometown. He’s a decent man, often wearing rough work clothes.“He was a big, solid guy and he knew he should dress more respectably because women sometimes crossed to the other side of the street if they saw him walking behind them at night. He always wanted to shout out his apologies.”I do feel for these fellows who seem scary for no fault of their own. But as much as I enjoyed the individual characters and the last 25% or so of the story, the first three-quarters was so slow and (I hate to say it) boring that if it hadn’t been Liane Moriarty writing, I’d have abandoned it before the story picked up. I kept thinking (hoping, hoping!) something would happen that would explain why the beginning was so uninspiring. Having said that, I can see this easily being the basis for another mini-series. The cast possibilities are endless, and I reckon a good script with more suspense and bite could easily be developed from this. The premise is good and the ending is good. It's just way too slow getting there.Thanks to NetGalley and Pan Macmillan for the copy for review. I’ll still look forward to her next one."
17,5.0,"EXCERPT: The waitress approached the table . . . noting how they each sat in the same distinctive way, with their ankles locked around the front legs of their chairs, as if to prevent them from sliding away. 'Excuse me?'They didn't hear her. They were all talking at once, their voices overlapping. They were definitely related. They even sounded similar: low,deep, husky-edged voices. People with sore throats and secrets. 'She's not technically missing. She sent us that text.''I just can't believe she's not answering her phone. She always answers.''Dad mentioned her new bike is gone.''What? That's bizarre.''So . . . she just cycled off down the street and into the sunset?''But she didn't take her helmet. Which I find very weird.''I think it's time we reported her missing.''It's over a week now. That's too long.''Like I said, she's not technically -''She is the very definition of missing because we don't know where she is.'The waitress raised her voice to the point where it was perilously close to rude. 'Are you ready to order yet?'They didn't hear her. 'Has anyone been over to the house yet?''Dad told me please don't come over. He's ""very busy"".''Very busy? What's he so busy doing?'The waitress shuffled alongside them, in between the chairs and the wall, so that one of them might see her. 'You know what could happen if we reported her missing?' The better looking of the two men spoke. He wore a long sleeved linen shirt rolled up to the elbows; shorts and shoes without socks. He was in his early thirties, the waitress guessed, with a goatee and the low-level charismatic charm of a reality star or a real estate agent. 'They'd suspect Dad.''Suspect Dad of what?' asked the other man, a shabbier, chunkier, cheaper version of the first. Instead of a goatee, he just needed a shave. 'That he . . . you know.' The expensive version brother drew his finger across his neck. The waitress went very still. This was the best conversation she'd overheard since she'd started waitressing. 'Jesus, Troy.' The cheaper version brother exhaled. 'That's not funny.'The other man shrugged. 'The police will ask if they argued. Dad said they did argue.''But surely - ''Maybe Dad did have something to do with it,' said the youngest of the four, a woman wearing a short orange dress dotted with white daisies over a swimsuit knotted at the neck. Her hair was dyed blue (the waitress coveted that exact shade), and it was tied back in a sticky, wet, tangled knot at her neck. There was a fine sheen of sandy sunscreen on her arms as if she'd just that moment walked off the beach, even though they were at least a forty minute drive from the coast. 'Maybe he snapped. Maybe he finally snapped.'ABOUT 'APPLES NEVER FALL': The Delaney family love one another dearly—it’s just that sometimes they want to murder each other . . .If your mother was missing, would you tell the police? Even if the most obvious suspect was your father?This is the dilemma facing the four grown Delaney siblings.The Delaneys are fixtures in their community. The parents, Stan and Joy, are the envy of all of their friends. They’re killers on the tennis court, and off it their chemistry is palpable. But after fifty years of marriage, they’ve finally sold their famed tennis academy and are ready to start what should be the golden years of their lives. So why are Stan and Joy so miserable?The four Delaney children—Amy, Logan, Troy, and Brooke—were tennis stars in their own right, yet as their father will tell you, none of them had what it took to go all the way. But that’s okay, now that they’re all successful grown-ups and there is the wonderful possibility of grandchildren on the horizon.One night a stranger named Savannah knocks on Stan and Joy’s door, bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend. The Delaneys are more than happy to give her the small kindness she sorely needs. If only that was all she wanted.Later, when Joy goes missing, and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the police question the one person who remains: Stan. But for someone who claims to be innocent, he, like many spouses, seems to have a lot to hide. Two of the Delaney children think their father is innocent, two are not so sure—but as the two sides square off against each other in perhaps their biggest match ever, all of the Delaneys will start to reexamine their shared family history in a very new light.MY THOUGHTS: Apples Never Fall is an excellent family drama/mystery that delves into family dynamics with disarming honesty and more than a little humour. I laughed as I recognized shades of myself and my three brothers in these conversations. Even Savannah was startlingly familiar. Though the cuckoo in our nest was called Sharilyn, and she was far more benign than Savannah. Moriarty has a definite talent for characterisation. Her characters are vibrant and alive, and tend to leap off the page and move into your life for the duration of the book. This, combined with her devious mind which conjures up intriguing mysteries, guarantees a read that just can't be put down. Like an onion, the layers of the Delaney family are peeled back one by one, revealing their insecurities, their resentments, their petty jealousies, their disappointments, their fears. Like most families, they have wallpapered over the cracks in their lives, given up on their dreams, settled for second best, all the time telling themselves that it's just life, that this is the reality of adulthood. But when Savannah intrudes and Joy goes missing, the plasters are ripped off, the wounds and battle scars exposed for all to see. There are some shocking revelations and surprises!Although the mystery of Joy's disappearance is always there, it is not the main focus of the story. It is merely a vehicle for the dissection of a family unit under pressure; an examination of their values, their loyalties, their coping strategies. I would be interested to learn if Brooke ever has another migraine. Apples Never Fall had me laughing and, at one point, snivelling into a fistful of tissues. Moriarty put my emotions through the wringer. Apples Never Fall is an irresistible read. It's charming, and surprising, just what I have come to expect from one of my favourite authors. What I wasn't expecting was that final chapter. Stunning!⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐#ApplesNeverFall #NetGalley I: #lianemoriarty @macmillanaus T: #LianeMoriarty @MacmillanAus #fivestarread #contemporaryfiction #familydrama #mystery THE AUTHOR: She lives in Sydney with her husband, son and daughter.

18,3.0,kind of makes me laugh that i was bitching about middle aged couples and their portrayal in thrillers and then this book comes along
19,5.0,"What a tangled story ... and I loved it all!The Delaneys are a flawed, complicated, and extremely close family. Add to that Savannah, with her own faults, issues, and shady agenda. Together, they are quite an unforgettable group of characters. This is an intricate character-driven story full of surprises. I was hooked by the mystery and revelations, and really felt I got to know all the characters. Told in alternating timelines (Then and Now) and multiple POVs (main characters and community), it's a well rounded and captivating story. I loved the humor and perspective the story offered, while tackling some serious issues.I've read every book Liane Moriarty has written, and this one's now my favorite. I highly recommend the audiobook. As usual, Caroline Lee did a fantastic job bringing another one of the author's books to life."
20,5.0,"Do you have a favorite Liane Moriarty book? I’m a fan, and I think this one is mine, but then I always think her latest book is my favorite! 😍 Apples Never Fall is the story of the Delaney family. They are peas in a pod, those Delaneys. One day the mother, Joy, goes missing, and the Delaney father, Stan, is the prime suspect in her disappearance. Married for over fifty years, they seem like the perfect power couple ready to enjoy a new stage of life together. That said, they are beyond unhappy. The Delaneys have four adult children together.A stranger named Savannah appears one night, and the Delaneys allow her to stay. That’s when Joy goes missing, and only Stan is left holding the bag when his wife (and Savannah) are gone. Two children side with Stan in his innocence, but the other two aren’t so sure. Who do you believe?This is a juicy little mystery with a WOW ending I never saw coming. Lots of family drama in these pages, and a well-written, engaging story to boot. I already have hopes we’ll see it on the small screen one day. Well-done!I received a gifted copy.

21,4.0,"Ahh it doesn't get much better than a family which loves one another dearly - so much in fact, that they just want to murder each other sometimes, and may have done just that. I must admit, I was not a big fan of Liane Moriarty's previous two books, but this one reminded me of why Moriarty has been one of my go-to authors for years! The Delaney family is the envy of their Australian community - everyone knows them and loves this tennis-obsessed family. Not only did parents, Stan and Joy, once run a successful school where they coached renowned tennis players, including their four now-adult children; they still successfully compete in doubles tournaments in their golden years. All appears to be perfect until one night a stranger named Savannah knocks on Stan and Joy’s door, and life changes for them all. Fast forward less than a year later, and Joy Delaney disappears, and Stan's suspicious behavior places him as suspect numero uno, and even their children have doubts. Once Joy disappears, everyone speculates what exactly went on in the Delaney household after Savannah entered their lives, and the Delaney children begin evaluating their parents’ marriage and their family history with fresh, suspicious eyes.Interestingly, although the storyline focuses largely on a missing woman and a husband accused, it really isn't the focal point of the book. It is more about complex family relationships and rivalries, and is part contemporary fiction, part mystery. I love Moriarty's use of wry humor, even in an intense family drama. I also found it very clever how past and present day were weaved together in alternating chapters, not only with the main characters, but also with random secondary characters - it added an interesting touch to the back stories. Although this one doesn't contain the shocking, fantastical moments that some of her other books do, in signature Moriarty fashion, the plot takes numerous twist and turns, and the characters become more relatable with every chapter. I couldn't put it down, as I needed to find out what happened to Joy.The one thing I will say is that it is a LONG book, and I felt like it could have been a hundred pages shorter without taking anything away from the plot. I also thought that the sudden jump to COVID-world at the very end of the book felt out of place and forced - it just wasn't necessary. Overall, though, I found this to be a gripping family drama that deftly explores how parental expectation, even unintended, can become toxic to an entire family. 4 stars."
22,5.0,"I FINALLY FINISHED A BOOK ! It took forever, but I loved it. (*And it didn't take too long because of the book, it took too long because of my life at the moment. An almost 500 page book does not go quickly when you only get 10 minutes a night to read!)I know there are a lot of mixed reviews out there for this book. People complain they have no idea what the point was, nothing happens, it's too long (it kind of was - more on that in a second), but you know what? I absolutely, 100% could not have loved and appreciated this more.Real quick - if you have a chance to listen to the audiobook of this. I HIGHLY recommend that you do. (Or split your time like I did between reading and listening.) The narrator is so amazing in how she brought the crazy Delaney family to life. Particularly, in her personification of Joy Delaney. I was laughing out loud, in public - I don't mean chuckling - I mean full out guffawing. My husband looked at me weird a few times. Having the narrator's voice of each character in my head while I was reading was such a pleasure. This was NOT a plot based book - this is strictly character driven, so if you don't like those then 100% steer clear. The book I would relate this to that I've read in the past few years is All Adults Here. It is just like that in terms of you follow different members of a family in each chapter and the story is about a time in the life of this family.Joy (the matriarch of the Delaney family) is missing. Her four kids don't quite realize she is missing until they realize she is. It kind of looks like Stan (their father), may have had some involvement, but did he? Then there was this mysterious house guest that stayed with Joy & Stan for a few weeks a couple of months before she disappeared. Is she involved in Joy's disappearance? So many questions and it takes a long time to get through it, but wow, I loved every single second of that journey. This family was amazing to spend time with. I also loved how you zoomed out and got small chapters from neighbor's and police detectives and hairdressers and other extraneous people that had some connection to the Delaney family. It was just so great.Book length - yes. It's too long. I'm not quite sure what to cut though? I had the same thought with The Most Fun We Ever Had. That book was entirely too long and it made it drag, but for whatever reason this book did not drag for me. There was a period during the last 100 pages where I kept thinking this is the end. Oh wait, no it's not? Okay, now it's the end. Still? Not the end? But it didn't annoy me because it was providing a conclusion. I've been going through a lot in my life for the past month and a half. A lot of it has been very stressful and it has been wonderful to turn to this family every night and catch up with them. I will hold this book in my heart forever because of it. (Sorry this review is a jumbled mess, I'm writing it in a hurry!)Thank you so much to Henry Holt Books for the gifted print copy, Liane Moriarty and Libro.fm for the gifted ALC.

23,3.0,"Book = 467 pages totalling 144k words. Number of times a word appears:Mother = 494Father = 271Dad = 253Tennis = 244Girl = 237Love = 217Parents = 176Mum = 152Body = 65Migraine = 57Hate= 51Apple = 44Crumble = 27…71 chapters.Average reading time: 11 to 12 hours (less than 8 for me).Audiobook: 18.1 hours (at normal speed)I know that I’m bored when I start counting words.Anyways… this book started very well and I thought that I was in for a good ride.Although I enjoyed the writing, the humour and the book structure, I did find it a bit boring and pointless. I did not even feel that entertained. I do think that it could have been reduced by 150 pages.I like reading stories around dysfunctional families, but here I thought that everything was too shallow. The fact that I wasn’t connected with any of the characters was not a problem, but I wish that I was able to feel something instead of numbness.I also tried the audiobook (borrowed from the public library) narrated by Caroline Lee, but unfortunately her voice is too squeaky for my ears and I couldn’t stand it.As for the conclusion, the author added a small section that includes the current pandemic, perhaps to make this book more current, but I don’t think that it was necessary, as it added nothing to the drama. Then we have the solution of the mystery, which wasn’t what I expected.So, why 3 stars? Because of her writing. There is a quality that I can’t ignore and it’s also so unpretentious, just the way I like."
24,4.0,"Apples Never Fall by Liane Moriarty was a very enjoyable read. The story revolves around Stan and Joy Delaney, a couple of tennis tragics – having run a Tennis Academy in Sydney for many years. They have now sold their business and have four adult children, Logan, Amy, Troy and Brooke. Parents and kids alike were all terrific tennis players, just on the cusp of ‘making it’. As with any large family, there’s some interesting interplay between family members, such as sibling rivalries, jealousies – resentments and the parents have the usual smattering of issues you’d expect from any long-term married couple. This alone is interesting enough for a story.Enter Savannah, a mysterious girl who comes into the lives of the Delaney family. This turns the family on its head – the reader is left guessing what this young woman is all about, why is she there? You know, I’m not sure if it was the familiarity of Australian life (in Sydney), the sport of Tennis – which, along with cricket is a staple of the Aussie sporting diet over the summer months, or the writing. It’s probably all of these factors that made this a very enjoyable read for me. I found it fresh and lively and I was looking forward to picking it up after a day at work. The ending was a little unexpected, which was good.If you enjoy a mystery with a good dash of family drama – you’ll probably enjoy this one.4 StarsMany thanks to Netgalley for providing me with a copy in exchange for my review."
25,4.0,"In this family drama, Liane Moriarty does what she does really well, and that is to write interesting character studies and family dynamics. The Delaney family of parents and four grown children from 29 to 39, on the surface seem to be a normal, loving family. But like many families there are secrets, resentments and personality flaws seething below the surface. The Delaney parents, Stan and Joy are recently retired after running a well known tennis academy for fifty years. Their children Amy, Troy, Logan and Brooke all grew up playing competitive tennis but none had the dedication to go on to the world circuit, something Stan has never quite forgiven them for. Now with too much time on their hands, Joy is hoping for the arrival of grandchildren to help fill the void tennis has left. Although Troy is divorced and Amy never seems to keep a boyfriend long, Logan is in a long term relationship, and Brooke married although busy getting her new physiotherapy practice off the ground.The novel is told in two lines, telling of two significant events in the family. In the current time line, Joy disappears on Valentines’ Day 2020, sending the children a text to say she is going off grid for a while. She’s never disappeared before but the family are sure she will return soon. However, when she doesn’t return within a few days they report her missing to the police. Some months prior to Joy disappearing, a young woman, Savannah, turned up on Joy and Stan’s doorstep saying she had run away from her abusive boyfriend. Despite her being a stranger, they took her in, offering her a place to stay until she finds her feet. The children are suspicious of Savannah’s motives and concerned that she has become close with their mother and doesn’t look in a hurry to leave. She seems very sweet and nice but is she too good to be true?I found the build-up of both the two story lines somewhat slow, but intriguing enough to keep me reading. There was a lot of character development, which is always one of this author's strengths. Also a lot about the siblings’ life and their time growing up in a tennis academy, as well as a lot of details of the police investigation of the family. I did enjoy the myriad of little facts sprinkled through the novel that turned out to be important when they later slotted into place, but overall I felt the novel lacked some of the quirkiness and spark that add that little bit of fun and magic to Moriarty’s best novels.With many thanks to Pan Macmillan Australia and Netgalley for a copy to read"
26,5.0,"Oh, is Liane Moriarty a sly one indeed. This is a clever book written by a deft and skilled author. What seems like a story simply about the dynamics of family relationships becomes more complex when a dysfunctional family’s own interactions intersect. We find out immediately in the prologue that the mother, Joy is missing, and no one seems to know where she could be. Each chapter takes us back and forth between then, a year ago, and now. We’ll learn much more about each of the four siblings, as well as Joy and Stan’s marriage.Joy and Stan ran a successful tennis academy both being former tennis champions themselves. As Joy fell into running the business Stan did most of the coaching. They each taught classes as the business grew. At the start of this story Joy and Stan are retired and have sold the tennis academy. Having been active all their lives adjusting to retirement is taking some time. Joy constantly regrets the time she was too busy to spend with her kids when they were younger, she wonders why they never call her, she worries if she’ll ever have grandchildren. Stan meanwhile is content watching TV from his recliner falling asleep for occasional cat naps.One night, as it approaches midnight, there’s knocking on their front door. Naturally they assume their kids would call first if it were one of them, but yet they open the door. A young, distraught women, girl really, wet and bruised comes tumbling in, barefoot no less. Joy instantly brings her into the kitchen to clean and bandage her wound, offering her something to eat, before they know anything about her. They do learn her name is Savannah, she had a fight with her boyfriend, and she has nowhere else to go. Joy insists she stay the night, she does, in fact she stays several months. They still don’t know much more about Savannah, but she will play a key role in the Delaney family in many ways, as they are yet to discover.The adult kids are each interesting and the dialogue is funny and occasionally a bit weird.Amy, the eldest, seems to have mental health issues, but Joy feels, “she’s tough as nails at her core.”Logan, the eldest of the two boys, never really interested in tennis, is laid-back and seems so confident. Again, Joy knows, “he just pretends not to care, but he really does.”Troy, the third child, always the angry teen, always competitive, angling for his father’s attention especially the coaching he was giving to another student. As an adult he’s still competitive as a trader, flying between Sydney and New York as if they were just a few miles apart, dressing well, always wanting the best. Joy knows, “he acts superior, but feels inferior.”Brooke, the youngest and baby of the family, used to getting everyone’s attention, ’but wants to be the most grown-up of all the adult kids.’ But her Physiotherapy clinic is barely making it and her marriage is not working.“Only Joy knew exactly what lay behind the facades her children presented to the world.”Yet, as with most families, when siblings return to the family home as adults, especially all at one time, we all tend to revert to our childhood relationships of petty rivalries, competitiveness, as if we were all still twelve years old. Be prepared to spend a year with the Delaney family. If you get impatient, do not skip ahead, and for the love of lollipops, DO NOT READ THE LAST CHAPTER.It will NOT tell you anything about Joy, and it will make absolutely NO SENSE unless you’ve read the entire story. Please, trust me on this!We do find out about Joy and why it takes so long to figure things out. I’m being careful of my wording, so I don’t give anything away. It’s great and you’ll love it, at least I did. Last word. At 480 pages (print ARC) this story may not move as quickly as some readers might want, but if you settle in and approach it as a good mystery, spending time getting to know one family while discovering the total imbalance of another, you will surely be rewarded. Thank you, Henry Holt and Company, for the galley, and to Liane Moriarty!"
27,5.0,"Having Caroline Lee read this new Liane Moriarty release is the secret ingredient in my book experience. This is, without a doubt, my favorite so far from the esteemed author. There are so many moving parts: tennis, marriage difficulties, sibling rivalry, revenge, cell phones, flirting, shopping, memoirs, and so much more. The least of which is the famous apple crumble. What is it that gives it that over the top taste that no other apple crumble can match? And you need four apples to make it --love the cover art. There are also four Delaney children. Hmmm! So much to unpack with this one. I love, love, love this one. The surprises kept popping up. Each time I thought we had reached the conclusion, up goes the curtain for another scene that perfectly complements and completes the prior narrative. If you can, listen to it. You will not be disappointed!Thank you to Macmillan Audio and NetGalley for an audio ARC in exchange for an honest review."
28,5.0,I loved the book as I knew I would. It is a great family story with a mystery. There are some major surprises in this too. The people who gave it low ratings prior to the ARC release were ridiculous. I am glad I offset it with my review.

“The police might be calling it a missing persons investigation, but anyone with a brain knows they’re treating it as a murder investigation.”
Family drama, a random stranger appearing at the family home in the night, a missing woman and a husband who probably did it???? I mean this sounds like my cup of tea. Oh AND it’s by Liane Moriarty. What’s not to love? Now where did I leave that Tina Belcher gif????? Oh yeah, here it is . . . . . 

This was a huge hit for all of my friends, but I’m sad to report it missed the mark a bit – okay a lot – for me. For as much of a fan I am of family dysfunction I should have been falling all over myself. And I was …. right up to the point where I got my hands on a copy. At first I placed the blame on our air conditioning shooting craps in an Autumn that refuses to not be 90+ outside every day. So I put it aside and waited until the repairman worked his magic and I was no longer a fat, sweaty, whiny baby. But unfortunately I still didn’t connect. The pacing here was slooooooooow and could have easily been dropped by 100 pages. And for as much time as I had to spend with each of the characters i felt like I really didn’t get to know them beyond their flaws and medical ailments. I predicted the first big reveal nearly immediately because …. well, duh and had to wait what seemed like an eternity for confirmation my guess was correct. Moriarity did perform her typical magic trip of weaving together random nuggets dropped throughout the story into an ending that tied everything up in a big bow. That should have redeemed some of my grumblings, but still - soooooooo many pages getting to the good stuff and then 50+ more at the end rather than just wrapping things up. Whyyyyyyy? Not to mention those “random nuggets” I’m a fan of? Turns out I’m not so much of a fan when I’m beaten over the head with reminders about them over and over again. Kind of takes the fun out of the big reveal when you’re just waiting for that magnet to come back into play somewhere. And pleeeeeeaaaaase stop with all new books containing some sort of “shoutout” to the pandemic. Most of us read to escape the real world so this shit has already gotten old. Moriarty’s books have worked great as limited run series adaptations. They are full of quality characters and developments and action that keeps you tuning in each week. There’s zero chance this could keep my attention for more than a two hour film, if that, and this is one time where the Lifetime channel quality plot wasn’t enough to satisfy me : (2.5 Stars"
30,3.0,"Joy and Stan Delaney had retired after selling their tennis school business, which had been very successful over the years. Joy found herself bored with all the time she had available and wished at least one of her adult children would give her grandchildren. When there was a frantic knock on their door late one evening, and a bleeding young woman entered their home, Joy and Stan had no idea who the woman was and what a change she would bring to their lives.Savannah was the victim of domestic violence and Joy felt the need to care for her, even though she knew nothing about her. Joy found her spirits lifted, especially when Savannah began cooking meals for them as a thank you. When Troy and Logan, Joy and Stan’s two sons, went with Savannah to retrieve her possessions, they kept her safe. Brooke and Amy, their two daughters, were horrified at this strange young woman taking advantage of their parents, but Joy wouldn’t be swayed. When Joy disappeared and it was over a week before her disappearance was reported to the police, Stan was immediately in their crosshairs. He was quite obviously lying – they were sure he’d killed her. Especially when they learned of a big fight between Joy and Stan just before her disappearance. With the four adult children speaking to the police, examining the long marriage that their parents had behind them, they were frightened. What was going on? Was their mother dead? And had their father killed her?Apples Never Fall is the latest by Aussie author Liane Moriarty and I enjoyed some parts but not others. The focus on tennis was always there and I found the story overly long, too much thinking while waiting for something to happen. One example was when Troy and Logan took Savannah to her old house – the men stepped out of the car, then pages and pages passed with Troy thinking, before Savannah eventually got out of the car. I also couldn’t make much sense of the final chapter – it seemed irrelevant. A little disappointed but I know others have loved it. And I love our Australian cover with the big granny smith apple tree loaded with fruit.With thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for my digital ARC to read in exchange for an honest review. "
31,5.0,"Liane Moriarty is a favorite author of mine. I really had no idea what this book was about. But wait, this could be me 69 year old mother married 50 years goes missing, only I don’t have four children who were tennis stars. Oh well.It made me think what would my children do if I went missing.The Delaney is a very close knit family. The four adult children, Amy, Logan, Troy and Brooke have a dilemma, their mother is missing and their father has scratches all over his face. What happened to their mother? They each received a cryptic text message that she was going off grid. Then there is the mysterious Savannah, who knocks on Joy and Stan’s door one night bleeding.The Delaney’s invite her to stay like she is family.This is a very engaging family saga filled with drama as the siblings relationships are put to the test. Each sibling had a different perception of what happened. Two felt Dad was guilty, two felt he was innocent.Don’t miss this dynamic family mystery. The ending is jar dropping."
32,5.0,"Stan and Joy Delaney have been married for almost fifty years, they live in a quiet street on the outskirts of Sydney and the couple recently sold their successful tennis coaching business and have retired. They have four adult children, Troy, Logan, Amy and Brooke and the couple are classed as empty nesters. The one thing Joy doesn’t have, is grandchildren, and she’s eagerly waiting for one of her children to make her a grandmother.Joy mysteriously vanishes on a hot summers day, she left home, didn’t take her phone, handbag, spare clothes and her bank account hasn’t been touched. Stan’s a big man, he’s fit for his age, and he wouldn’t have harmed Joy, hid any evidence and lied to his children? The Delaney siblings are suddenly looking back at their childhood, for any signs their parent’s marriage wasn’t a happy one and like most couples they had the odd disagreement. Joy seemed happy being a wife, mother, business and tennis partner of Stan. Did she resent being the only one to cook the family meals, pack the school lunches, do endless loads of washing, did they all take what she did for granted and has she done a runner?Stan and Joy, had a young woman stay with them for six weeks last year, her name is Savannah, and could she have something to do with Joy’s disappearance? As the two detectives, family, friends and business acquaintances look back at life in the Delaney home, conversations, family interactions and celebrations can be viewed very differently and opinions vary. Liane Moriarty has a way of layering a story, with lots of little details and moments, that makes you think about what really goes on behind closed doors and anything is possible.I received a copy of Apples Never Fall from NetGalley and Pan Macmilan Australia, it has the perfect amount of intrigue, mystery, suspense, anticipation and family drama, and five stars from me.https://karrenreadsbooks.blogspot.com/"
33,4.0,"Joy Delayne disappears one day. For a while, her husband, Stan, and their four adult offsprings don't think much of it. But time passes and there's no news.The Delaneys are a formidable couple. Until recently, they ran a very successful tennis academy, they're well-known members of the community. Joy Delaney was the mother, business brain, accountant, cook, cleaner, nurse, events organiser. She doesn't cope well with her new retired life. The empty nest feels emptier than usual. Not being constantly busy and challenged by the latest dramas and emergencies gives one time to think, reminisce. And get irritated with one's husband. When a young woman appears at their door, bloodied and shivering, Joy takes her in. What if she's one of the kids' friends that she doesn't remember now?Joy and Stan bandage her and put her up for the night.Slowly, Savannah eases herself into their lives. She's an amazing cook. Joy is so grateful, she hates cooking, she's had enough. Moriarty deftly unpeels the layers of each family member. They're an interesting bunch. Through a variety of PoVs, including short ones from neighbours, friends and other acquaintances, we put together what's happened.While the build-up is slow it sure picks up the pace in the last quarter.As always, Moriarty's characters are real, layered and imperfect - just the way I like them.The adage - you never truly know anyone - shines through.Read the book before you see the miniseries (I'm sure it will snatched, if it hasn't already happened).I've received this ARC in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks to Pan Macmillan Australia for the opportunity to read and review this novel. "
34,1.0,"1.5 stars. This book. Was so boring. 464 tedious pages and very little happened. Like, it felt dull and slow the entire time, and then towards the end you find out — surprise! — even LESS happened than you were led to believe. What a twist!The characters/relationships didn’t feel believable at all to me, the timeline jumping around served no apparent purpose, the tennis stuff was tedious, the commentary on traditional marriage roles felt forced, the end was way too tidy, the last few chapters haphazardly talked about COVID because… idk, just because. And then the final chapter was wild. Over the top, but at least it was interesting.I’d advise not wasting your time on this one like I unfortunately did. But a lot of these other reviews are somehow positive, so who knows — maybe you’ll like it more than me! 🤞🏼Thanks to Henry Holt and Co. for sending me an advance copy of this book, I really was excited about it!"
36,5.0,"I love Liane Moriarty and was excited to read this even before I knew what it was about. After reading the synopsis I really couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I was super hyped. Then of course I started to worry that I was going to be let down. Nope! I LOVED it. I was gripped right from the start and while I was curious to find out how it was going to end, I was sad when it was over. I've seen some mixed reviews (obviously we're not all going to love all the books) but for me, this was a hit. Really hope we don't have to wait to long for the next Liane Moriarty novel! "
37,4.0,"Apples Never Fall is the fourth or fifth book I've read by Liane Moriarty. I enjoy her character development, family drama, and immersive settings. In this release, a family of former tennis stars takes center stage, and when one of them disappears, all the cracks in their façade begin to show. Two parents, four adult children, some with significant others, and a stranger who shows up on the doorstep. How is she connected with them all?This is not a suspense or thriller book. It's really not even a mystery. Although the prologue clearly suggests a hit-and-run, perhaps a death, the story isn't about a desire to turn the pages to find out what happened. It's more of an in-depth analysis on the relationships between parents and children, brothers and sisters, and husbands and wives. When Savannah, a younger woman with seemingly no connection to the family, wanders into their lives, readers quickly question... did one of the parents have an affair? Is she a jilted lover of the adult children who each have something to lose? The truth is a bit murky, but it does have a connection, and it throws a dollop of chaos into the book.Joy disappears. She's the matriarch. Often, I liked her. At times, she was too domineering or too removed. The father, Stan, seemed like a nice guy but there was underlying tension that could've broken free at any moment. All the kids were fairly normal, each with their own set of idiosyncrasies (we all have them). The way they related to each other as family was bizarre. Perhaps because I'm an only child I don't know much about it, yet each was so passive-aggressive, I wanted to slap them all back into proper behavior. Amy can't commit and is on medicine to keep her from getting out of control. Troy is out to sleep with anything he can. Logan can't figure out how to love his wife. Brooke is too committed to her non-tennis career.So why did Savannah show up? Why did Joy up and disappear? Did someone kill her? The book was a slow boil and kept my interest... but that last chapter was unnecessary. The timeline brings us to the beginning of COVID's arrival. We've just made all the connections and learned what happened. It could've ended there. I can't give away any spoilers, so I'll stop... just know that it will be a painful ending."
38,5.0,"Oh how I love Australian writer Liane Moriarty. One of my all time favourite books is What Alice Forgot, so when I hear about a new book coming the excitement builds. Apples Never Fall had all the ingredients of another hit and she nailed it once again. I hope this one will also been made into a series, I would love to see this on the screen.Meet the Delaney family - Stan, Joy and their 4 adult children - Loga, Brooke, Troy and Amy. The family used to run a successful tennis academy until recently and now Joy and Stan are retired. All the kids grew up playing tennis to please their parents but did they really want to? As with every family there are secrets, lies, resentment and lots of love. Sibling rivalry is a big part of this family drama. It is funny, emotional and real. I love how the author tugs at the heart strings and brings her characters to life. When Joy goes missing without a trace, no note and her bike discarded, the family is worried. It is not like Joy to not call, not answer her phone. But the siblings know that their father will be the prime suspect - it is always the husband right! We learn about the family in the now and flashbacks to the past. And who is Savannah and how does she fit into all of this?Liane Moriarty fans will love this story, set in my hometown. Full of drama and laughs, it is one not to miss.Thanks to MacMillan Australia for my advanced copy of this book to read."
39,4.0,"I didn't understand the last chapter. I kind of understood who was who, but there's a suspicion that the author was trolling in a way different from the rest of the book. It seems like Moriarty had overextended her resources. She might have worked the ending during a late night in buzzing critter infested Australia. At least that's what I imagined.The book is better than what I read of her other books. This book is special. It is the same with me with jokes. Recently I've been cracking more good jokes than usual. If the sense of humour is like a muscle, then so is the knack to write book after book. Stephen King practically said that if one can subsist on one's writing, he considered that person a good writer. So why does he keep degrading James Patterson?What's my business in this entire reading experience is the fact that just like with the best of writers, the words kept reaching my eyes with no lull in quality, bar a couple of early chapters where I imagined giving the book 2 stars. Apples Never Fall is such a surprising title that I thought there must be a tennis reference buried in it. Fat chance of that.Among the four siblings in the story, I mentally reached out to poor Brooke, who cannot catch a happy ending to match those of her brothers and one sister. But she does get a smashing (yep) apple crumble in the end. That counts, right? The most satisfying tennis trivia I have independently known is about why zero is called love in tennis. You should google it.I was thoroughly entertained by this book, which I bought from Amazon. I feel the necessity to support the best authors who repay you with words worth more than the book's price. Begging, borrowing, or stealing won't do here. I was reminded of how powerful a reading experience can be. The latter can be classified in merely the mystery/thriller register. But that would be unfair. There are traces of literariness, and chick lit in the mix. In the end, don't we readers crave for something similar? I look to the next book of Moriarty with great anticipation."
40,2.0,"Thank you to Macmillan Audio for this ALC..The 17 hours that I spent listening to this book are 17 hours I will never, ever see again. Do I regret this audiobook? Yes. Yes I definitely do. Moriarty man, first Nine Perfect Strangers and now this? .I waited every minute of every hour, for SOMETHING, ANYTHING to happen. And it never did. It never did. Sure, there was the signature Moriarty humor that I enjoyed and had a good chuckle. There were a few revelations that resonated with me. The characters were somewhat compelling. But ultimately, this felt like seventeen hours of nada lotta..The end confused me. First, why an hour and a half more after the main ""plot"" was revealed? Was that necessary? And the COVID content felt entirely random and tacked on to the end with little to no purpose. I know there is supposedly a twist and the very, very end - but at that point I had no interest and could barely coax myself into listening closely enough to understand..This is one I cannot rec to anyone tbh. :("
41,5.0,"Apples Never Fall is the ninth novel by best-selling Australian author, Liane Moriarty. When sixty-nine-year-old Joy Delaney goes missing on Valentine’s Day after a garbled text message to her four children, they are understandably concerned, especially as certain things (an argument that morning, scratches on his cheek, a professional car clean) sort of make their father, well-known tennis coach, Stan Delaney look guilty. Joy’s disappearance and her subsequent lack of communication is completely out of character so, of course, the Delaney siblings report their mother missing. Stan is strangely reticent when questioned by the police, and his adult children are being quite selective with what they reveal about their family. Detective Senior Constable Christina Khoury is finding it difficult to get a handle on this family. “On the surface they seemed loving and cheerful but she could sense dysfunction bubbling ominously beneath their sporty, matter-of-fact demeanours.” While the siblings are all very different, they do seem to agree that a potentially precipitating incident occurred during the previous September, when a mysterious young woman named Savannah was staying with the Delaney parents, and when tennis star (and their father’s former protégé) Harry Haddad announced a comeback. Only much later is it admitted that this was when some sensitive revelations were made, criticisms voiced and long-standing resentments aired.As well as split-time narratives from multiple character perspectives, the story is told by conversations overheard or gossip shared by the waitress, the beauty therapist, the physio patient, the Uber driver, the journalist, the neighbour, the receptionist, the hairdresser, and others.Some readers may find this too much of a slow-burn as Moriarty lays down the detail of the lives of each member of the Delaney family, but patience and persistence is rewarded as the story develops, with each new twist, turn and wrinkle adding another layer of intrigue before the dramatic reveal. Moriarty gives the reader a level of intimacy with these characters that may cause a lump in the throat on several occasions in the final chapters. A perfect mix of humour, heartache and drama, Moriarty’s latest does not disappoint.This unbiased review is from an uncorrected proof copy provided by NetGalley and Pan Macmillan Australia."
42,4.0,"I find Moriarty compulsively readable but her books are hit-or-miss when all is said and done. She's been changing it up and this new book, which still has high stakes but spends much of the time zeroing in on the intricate dynamics of one family, is her best yet. Moriarty is great at twist, building suspense, raising stakes. She also sometimes really goes for melodrama in ways that I don't enjoy. This book is very much based in everyday life and reality, even if it asks a rather melodramatic question: what would you do if you thought your father might have murdered your mother? And how would that crack apart a family?We answer this question on two timelines. The present, where mother Joy is missing, and a few months earlier when Joy and her husband Stan take in a stranger to stay with them. The stranger, Savannah, has an immediate impact on everyone, throwing off the usual routines, and sending all four adult children off kilter. Even though all the big stakes around what happened to Joy should be in the present timeline, it was the past one that I just could not get enough of. That is where we get to know the four siblings and their parents and see how they all see each other. I never really tried to answer the question of what had happened to Joy, or about who Savannah could be. I just let Moriarty pull me along and I enjoyed every minute.In a lot of ways this book is about the generation gap, particularly with respect to marriage and relationships, between Boomers like Stan and Joy and Millennials like their 4 kids. We see this play out in all kinds of ways, like how the parents are slow to understand and cope with Amy's mental health issues and Brooke's migraines. We also get to see all kinds of aspects of Stan and Joy's marriage. The Delaney's are a kind of golden family, known by everyone, held up as a kind of example, with Stan and Joy at the center of it. And yet, we see up close just how many cracks there are underneath this veneer, all the lingering resentments. Especially when it comes to Stan and his inability to work through conflict with the rest of the family. I could read ten more books like this in a row, I really love diving into this kind of domestic piece, with several characters, where we get to see all of them through each other's eyes. They all feel real and full, especially Joy who is one of those nonstop chatterers you have definitely met before. I thought the ending was great, even though I suspect some people will find it not big enough. Although Moriarty still throws a little twist at you to cap it off.Somehow this didn't feel like a murder book about potential domestic violence to me, which is weird, but there it is. I did the audio and really enjoyed it. The reader is the same as some of Moriarty's previous books and I feel like she's so well suited to the material. "
43,4.0,"Liane Moriarty returns to her domestic drama heartland in her latest release, Apples Never Fall.The dual timeline narrative follows the members of the Delaney family in suburban Sydney. Recently retired parents Joy and Stan remain highly competitive tennis players after selling their successful coaching academy. Their four adult children - Amy, Logan, Troy and Brooke - were also each successful junior players, none of whom managed to break into the professional circuit, and each face challenges in their personal and/or professional lives. The Delaney's comfortable, if imperfect, lives are impacted by the sudden arrival of Savannah, a young woman who knocks on Joy and Stan's front door one night, seeking assistance after experiencing domestic violence. The Delaney parents take her into their lives, offering her a temporary home, despite the misgivings of their four children.Some months later, Joy Delaney goes missing during a bike ride to the nearby shops. When she makes no contact, police begin to suspect foul play, and their investigation focusses on patriarch Stan. The situation places inevitable pressures on the remaining members of the family and their interrelationships.I found Apples Never Fall an engrossing domestic drama, with a healthy dose of intrigue and second-guessing of each of the characters' motivations and secrets. While not always particularly likeable, I found each of the central characters well-developed and identified with the concept that different members of the same family often have different recollections of the same events and that the scars borne in childhood often run deep. The conclusion was well-crafted and satisfying, but like other readers I felt that the novel could perhaps have concluded more successfully at the end of chapter 70. While intriguing, the rather macabre final twist felt superfluous and jarring.I'd encourage readers who enjoyed Liane Moriarty's early work - such as The Husband's Secret and Big Little Lies - to give this one a try. To my mind it's a return to form after her more experimental 2018 release Nine Perfect Strangers. Highly recommended.Thanks to the author, Liane Moriarty, publisher Pan Macmillan Australia and NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review this title."

46,5.0,"4.5/5I always love reading books by Liane Moriarty, and Apples Never Fall was the perfect example of Moriarty at her best. I loved the writing style she used, and I found myself chuckling or laughing out loud very consistently throughout the entire book. It reminded me a little bit of Anxious People in terms of writing style, and these are the kinds of books I love best. Joy's viewpoint always made me laugh, but I had a lot of fun with every single viewpoint there is. I loved the mix of the present timeline along with the past, and really enjoyed the way they tie together at the end. There are a lot of viewpoints, but I thought it was done very well and I never got confused about who anyone was. I liked the detective viewpoint as well, and besides Joy, I think hers was my favorite.Best of all, I LOVED the audiobook, which is narrated by Caroline Lee, and while I loved her narration for the entire book, I especially loved her for Joy. If I was going to voice cast, she is definitely who I would have picked, and she really brought Joy alive for me. The audio is fairly long at just over 18 hours, but I spent the whole time wishing it would never end. It didn't feel that long at all and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. While the ending wasn't a total surprise for me, there were still some great twists along the way that I wasn't expecting. I think that overall, I just loved the experience I had with this book, and I really think that if you loved Anxious People you will also love Apples Never Fall. I wouldn't say this is a fast-paced novel, but it felt very well-paced for me and I definitely liked the pacing more than Nine Perfect Strangers. I don't know much about tennis but that was a fun aspect as well and family drama abounds if you are into that too! Such a huge win for me with Moriarty and this is a book I will hold onto forever.Thank you to the publishers for my advanced listening and physical copies of this book. All opinions and thoughts are my own."
47,5.0,"Apples Never Fall is fabulous! A superbly written family drama that has all the elements of a true page turner. The prologue pulls the reader straight into a mystery. The story is told in present day where Joy Delaney is missing and then back over the previous five months that led up to Joy's disappearance.In the present day: the four grown Delaney children are trying to sort out their own feelings and the rising fear that maybe their father has harmed their mother. As police interview each family member it's clear everyone is holding something back and the circumstantial evidence against their father builds. Previously: recently retired Joy and Stan Delaney find that time on their hands leads to resentments, unspoken grievances and regrets.When a young woman arrives on their doorstep clearly distressed Joy invites her to stay. Suddenly Joy has meaning to life as she cares for Savannah.Savannah also gives Joy the attention that has been lacking from her children. But cracks start to form and everyone starts to wonder what Savannah's true agenda is.  Moriarty engineers a complex breaking down of each characters thoughts and dreams and we see everyone is holding something back. The mysteries are layered and compelling. Apples Never Fall is a keenly observed family drama with finely nuanced characters. Underlying themes of domestic violence, anger and child abuse give a chilling look at parents in competitive sports.  In Apples Never Fall Moriarty depicts marriage and family in all its love, rage, passion, grievances, regrets, dreams, resentments and splendid dysfunctionality. Above all this is a story of the complexity of family and all things that are left unsaid.I received my copy from the publisher"
48,4.0,"I enjoyed this one a lot more than I expected mainly because of the characters.When Joy Delaney goes missing the rumours start and it is not long before a possible murder is suspected but do her family notify the police? The Delaney family are a well known family in the local community with father Stan and mother Joy the envy of all their friends After fifty years of marriage they have sold their famed tennis academy and settled down for an enjoyable retirement. The four Delaney children, Amy, Logan, Troy and Brooke had varying success in their own tennis careers but never received any praise off their father, insisting they didn’t have what it takes to get to the top.Late one evening their is knock at Stan and Joy’s door, a stranger named Savannah is bleeding after a fight with her boyfriend and is looking for help. The Delaney’s are quick to offer Savannah help but it appears she is looking for more than they thought. Later, when Joy goes missing, and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the police question the one person who remains, Stan.Although Stan pleads his innocence there are a lot of unanswered questions which leads to suspicion. The family have split opinions regarding Stan’s innocence which leads to further arguing and digging in the families past.The book is more about the characters and their standings within the family rather than an whodunnit, lots of humour, twists and drama along the way make this an enjoyable read. Some really good character but my favourite was Joy who seem to offer every emotion to the story."
49,5.0,"Noone writes family dynamics quite like Liane Moriarty! In APPLES NEVER FALL, she takes us right into the heart of the Delaney family, whose life has always revolved around tennis. When the mother, Joy, disappears and her husband Stan falls under suspicion of having harmed her, her four adult children look back on their childhood and their parents’ marriage to see what they could have missed.I loved the way Moriarty slowly uncovers the family’s inner workings, their secrets, their regrets, their loyalties and rivalries. Whilst we mostly hear from the family members themselves, we also get snapshots of the siblings’ conversations and other moments observed by strangers and neighbours, which was an unusual and clever way of telling the story and deepening the mystery of Joy’s disappearance whilst also adding a unique angle. And who was the mysterious guest who had been staying with the Delaney’s? I was like the donkey following the carrot – always a step behind but so eager to get the answers!As with Moriarty’s other books, APPLES NEVER FALL is a slow burning, character driven mystery that focuses more on interpersonal dynamics and relationships than the actual mystery itself. The thing I love most about Moriarty’s books is the way she lets us see deep inside her characters’ heads and explore the deepest darkest corners of their psyche. This gives each character a depth often missed in other novels - noone is black and white here but complex personalities with a history that has shaped them. I particularly loved the way all four siblings remember the same events slightly differently, and the way those occasions affected each and every one of them and directed their future lives to some degree. Families are complex, and Moriarty has nailed it! As the story progressed, I felt that I knew each of the characters intimately, with the exception of Stan, who remained an enigma to the very end – with good reason. This was a long, thick book and yet I mourned the loss of each character as I closed that last page.If I had any gripes, I thought that the last chapters could have been cut out to leave it at the solution to the central mystery without that final “twist” and the inclusion of covid, both of which added little to the story for me and somehow didn’t quite fit the rest of the tale (just made the book longer). However, the rest of the book was still a solid 5 star read, one I enjoyed immensely and which touched my heart.In summary, APPLES NEVER FALL was the type of unputdownable character driven story I have come to expect from Liane Moriarty, and I enjoyed every stolen moment I could spare between work and chores to escape into it. Focusing on family dynamics, it contained everything I love in her books: strong enigmatic characters, a quintessentially Australian setting, a compelling mystery and that subtle tongue-in-cheek Aussie humour that always gets lost when someone decides to turn her books into a TV series. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it kept me glued to its almost 500 pages right until the end. Thank you to Netgalley and Pan Macmillan Australia for the free electronic copy of this novel and for giving me the opportunity to provide an honest review. *blog*  *facebook*  *instagram* "
50,3.0,"I enjoyed the characters of this book, but it seemed to drag! It took me forever to read. The book is about a family who lives,breathes, and loves tennis! It discusses each family member and all their positive and negative qualities! They even critique each other! I found the truthfulness to be the most invigorating! There were long life lessons dispersed throughout the book. The big event through the story was the disappearance of the mother,Joy, and the way the family and media dealt with the events. Of course the author did a great job wrapping up what had happened to the mom and why. The story did seem a bit long winded. Others who reviewed the book mentioned covid being in the ending chapters so, I was intrigued to carry on to the finish. However, I did enjoy the ending! Longing to know what happened to one character, wanting the best,expecting doom, and decidedly saying I’ll never know. I will say it seemed almost too much to think Joy could forgive Savannah for all her negative actions towards her own children. That part, just seemed unbelievable to me! Overall, I gave it a 3 because although it was long, I enjoyed it enough to carry on, and did enjoy watching the family drama, as it unfolded. "
51,4.0,"Yay!! One of Moriarty's best I think. If you enjoyed Big Little Lies, you need to read this. I thoroughly enjoyed this fun, suspenseful book and couldn't put it down. As always the author shines when writing stories set in the suburbs, and mixing up a mystery with a family saga worked exceptionally well. I loved getting to know Joy, Stan and all four their unique children. I think one of the things that I liked most was recognizing my own behavior in some of the behavioral patterns between the siblings, and between Joy and her children. Funny and insightful - I will be recommending this to everyone I know.The Story: Apples Never Fall is the story of Stan and Joy Delaney’s marriage, but it’s also the story of their four adult children, all of them a little lost and broken in their own ways."
52,2.0,usually never ever say i hated a book but i think i hated this 🥲😂😅 full review to come next week on my instagram. LOTS of bones to pick here. 
53,4.0,"The Delaneys are the ultimate tennis family. Joy and Stan were former top junior players who never made it in the highly competitive professional arena. But they turned their love of the sport, and each other, into their livelihood opening a tennis academy coaching the stars of the future. Once the couple had children, all four were groomed for success on the court. With the children now grown, Joy and Stan sold the business and looked ahead to their retirement, still continuing to play mixed doubles together. This engaging mystery thriller, set in Sydney, Australia, opens as their four children - Brooke, Troy, Logan and Amy meet to discuss their concern over the recent disappearance of their mother. The police are soon called in as concerns mount and persons of interest are identified. The story volleys between the present and past as the pieces of the puzzle are skillfully laid out. We learn about a former student of Stan’s, word-champion Harry Haddad, who is staging a comeback and is about to publish his memoir. Stan has never recovered from being replaced as the young prodigy’s coach just before he hit the big time. We also learn how desperate Joy is to become a grandmother. While she believes she is close to her children, she has little knowledge of the true state of their lives and relationships. Moriarty’s excellent storytelling provides interesting details on the lives of the four children. When a mysterious young woman arrives injured on Stan and Joy’s doorstep, Joy brings Savannah, who claims to be the victim of abuse, into their home. While the rest of the family questions the woman’s motives, Joy soon treats Savannah as a fifth child, moving her into Amy’s old room. So what happened to Joy? And if she has been harmed or worse, who is at fault? The scratches on Stan’s face put him high on the suspect list. Author Liane Moriarty has served up another ace with Apples Never Fall. While not my favorite of her many popular books, it did what a good thriller is supposed to do – held me in suspense, kept me guessing and surprised me in the end. Being a tennis player, it was a very good match. Apologies for the tennis puns. Also note that there are many references to apples in the book. I’ll let you discover those on your own.Review posted on MicheleReader.com."
54,4.0,"⭐️4 Stars⭐️I love Aussie writer Liane Moriarty, it was her books that got me back into reading again so I was absolutely thrilled when I received an early copy of Apples Never Fall!Apples Never Fall is going to be another hit, it’s a family saga where the mother goes missing without a trace and another family member becomes a murder suspect. ‘There were tiny seeds of bitter resentment at the centre of her heart, like the tiny bitter seeds at the centre of even the sweetest apple’.Meet the Delaney’s - Stan & Joy who have been married for nearly fifty years and their four adult children, Amy, Logan, Brooke and Troy. The Delaney’s have run a very successful tennis school and local tennis club. Their children grew up coached by their father but unfortunately none of them had the passion to become champion tennis players.The story is heavily character driven and has dysfunctional family dynamics, dramas and the unravelling of many secrets. There is a touch of humour throughout and the story goes back and forth between the present and the past. Apples Never Fall is more of a family saga than a thriller and there’s a heavy focus on competitive tennis and sibling rivalry. Recommended read, the mystery element will have you turning the pages!Publication date 14 September 2021Thank you to NetGalley and Pan McMillan Australia for an early copy to read."
55,4.0,"I adore Liane Moriarty and this was one of my most anticipated reads of the year! This read more like a contemporary fiction / family drama for me rather than a thriller but it did build a sense of foreboding that I really enjoyed. When Joy goes missing, at first, her family is unconcerned. She sent a text after all - though garbled and non sensical - indicating she was going off grid. But with no use of her credit cards, her cell phone left at home, and nothing noticeably missing, as the days and weeks go by, her kids start to suspect their parents’ marriage wasn’t quite what they thought and that their father may have murdered their mother.I loved the writing style of this novel. It alternated between past and present but the present story was told through bystanders overhearing important conversations and gossip or through the police investigation. Most of the story felt like a family drama as we learned of the Delaney’s dirty laundry and things from their past that may have led to Joy missing. Personally, I enjoyed the COVID aspect toward the end of the book. It made it feel very current though I can imagine in several years it will date the book and eventually make it less relatable to certain audiences. I also absolutely loved the ending. It was exactly where I needed the book to go and with the fact that most of the book wasn’t exactly a thriller, it added a thrilling element to the novel as a whole. My biggest gripe about this novel is the length. At a whopping 460 pages, it was unnecessarily long and probably would’ve been better kept around 100 less! It did read fairly fast though so if you love Moriarty, I wouldn’t let the length be a deterrent! A cross between We Are The Brennans and Not A Happy Family, if you loved either of those books, this is one you must pick up!"
56,5.0,"I have no hesitation rating this 5 stars, as it was clever and surprising, and right up there with my top read by Moriarty - Big Little Lies. I really enjoyed the characters too, particularly the four adult children - Amy, Logan, Troy, and Brooke. And, I'm not a sporty person, but even the tennis aspect was interesting. An all-round winner."
57,4.0," Amazing to think something beautiful could lie beneath the ugliness and all you had to do was peel it away.  Apples Never Fall is a dysfunctional family study on sibling rivalry and buried resentment. It is about family drama, regret, and revenge. The characters are competitive yet procrastinate. They love their family furiously but aren’t the close-knit kind. At the core, it is about the goodness in life that can be found by peeling back the dirty layers. Meet the Delaney’s: Stan and Joy, married for fifty years; and their four grown children, Amy, Logan, Troy, and Brooke. Plus a few exes, but no grandchildren. Their lives have always revolved around tennis. Either playing or coaching. It’s their business, literally. Stan and Joy recently sold their tennis school and have reluctantly settled into retirement. To their disappointment, none of their kids chose to continue in the family business. It took a couple of weeks before the Delaney children realized something was amiss. They had received a cryptic text from their mother about going off-grid. But the typos in the message and their own busy lives kept them from following up. Until now. They were worried about the lack of contact because it was so unusual to not hear from her every few days. Not so for their dad, who never owned a mobile phone or had much to say in general. Although the Delaney’s were concerned about their mother, they were reluctant to report her missing. They had differing opinions about this situation. Some felt their dad looked suspicious. Could he be involved with their mother’s disappearance? Or wondered if their parents’ recent houseguest, Savannah, could be connected. Others were sure their dad was telling the truth that he didn’t know where Joy was. The story was told in two timelines. The main timeline was from the present going forward with the police investigation being central. While the past chapters told what happened in the months leading up to Joy’s disappearance. Along the way, you get a POV from all the Delaney’s, the police, Savannah, and a few observers. The varying POVs were seamlessly written so I found it easy to follow. This was my first book by this author and my delight has been how keen was her view of families, marriage, and people. How she captured the frustrations, anger, joy, jealously of the characters. Some may call them flawed, but I’d rather think of them as normal. Because who isn’t flawed? However, the magic of the book was showing how relationships “ebbed and flowed over a day, or even a conversation.” I was interested the book right from the start, especially about unanswered questions I had on past family events and Joy’s disappearance. This momentum kept me going until I reached the 45%-75% mark. I just wanted to keep going with the mystery elements, but the narrative detoured into the Delaney’s inner thoughts and feelings. Maybe this section was too long. I grew restless even though I like big messy families. Once the plot gained momentum again, I could not turn the pages fast enough. The ending was not a surprise though. And I felt the explanation about Savannah’s motives was underwhelming. The part about the pandemic felt like an afterthought. Overall, I liked the mystery less than the character study. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the book, but I am a fan of domestic suspense and dysfunction. Which this author wrote with aplomb. Just know the mystery elements are not the focus of this complicated family drama."
58,4.0,"It was a race against the clock with this one people!

I haven't had as much time to read the last few weeks. For work reasons, my dad stays with us during the week sometimes and he has been here frequently lately. I love him to death but he can be...high maintenance. As in, he is an extrovert and doesn't really like to do stuff by himself. Except when he's reading. But he's not like me where I can read for hours. He reads for his allotted time each day and then he's ready to do stuff. Together. So my reading time has been more limited. But also I like to do this thing where I check out too many books from the library and then wait to late to start them until, before I know it, the library is yelling at me that I have one day left to finish the book and no I can't recheck it out because there are 500 people waiting for it. Rude!Me to Marci as we commiserate about our library woes and how she is the James Bond of the library system:

Ok anyway. I'm starting to feel like one of those recipe bloggers who want to tell me their life story and I'm scrolling and scrolling while shouting, ""JUST GIVE ME YOUR LEMON BAR RECIPE!""Liane Moriarty is an author who rarely misses her mark with me. I think there are only one or two that I haven't liked. She does tend to stick to a certain formula. A large cast of characters, lots of secrets and there's usually many POV shifts and time jumps. This one was no different. It's safe to say that if you've enjoyed her past novels, you'll like this one. If you haven't, you might want to steer clear. It works for me because while her formula might be the same, the characters are not and I think she writes such interesting, flawed people who are incredibly easy to connect with. While this one wasn't quite as good as  Big Little Lies  or  The Husband's Secret , I liked it a lot.The plot moved at a slow but not boring pace. More in a way that felt unsettling. The tension was slowly simmering and building. And it wasn't long before the carefully hidden SECRETS started revealing themselves.

(RIP to my attention span regarding  Pretty Little Liars  BTW. There are secrets and then there is the mess that was that show. But that's another story.)As the Delaney family fractured apart, while struggling to piece together what happened to Joy, I was riveted.

What I enjoy most about Moriarty's books is how she slowly reveals things. Again, some might find it annoying because she does this often, but I love it. The plot unravels layer by layer. It's all very delicate but gripping. Characters too. They show themselves slowly. At the beginning, I found most of the Delaney family annoying and by the end, I had warmed to all of them. Witchcraft.Now there was ONE thing that nearly put me off the whole book. It's not a spoiler so I won't tag it. But I almost took off stars for it. In the end, I decided not too because it was only the last 10% of the book or so. But suddenly, in the last few chapters, COVID reared its ugly head. I read to ESCAPE reality. I do not want Covid in my books. It seemed completely random and unnecessary too. Like she was mentioning it just to mention it. It was so bizarre and had no relevance to any of the story. Nope. Didn't care for it.

But even with the dreaded Covid, I enjoyed this one. And can't wait to see what secrets she cooks up next.

59,5.0,"It is so nice to have a new Liane Moriarty book to read and enjoy. This one was full on, denser than all her previous books, with all the elements that have made her so readable.Usually I hate too many characters and have trouble following who is whom and what were they doing in the story anyway. Not here, every character has a place and every major character is well developed and part of the journey. Especially the Delaney family, four adult children and their parents. A few major characters outside this inner circle, every one interesting, developed and relevant to the story. I found it very hard to put down.A minor quibble I seem to share with others is that it does go on for a few extra unnecessary chapters at the end, which slightly detracts from the story that should have ended earlier.Anyway I loved it, welcome back Liane, it's been too long between drinks."
60,5.0,"FIRST OF ALL, thank you so much to the publisher for sending me a physical ARC of this book, it made my year. I finished this book, immediately sobbed like a baby for a few minutes, and then opened up Goodreads to attempt to type my MYRIAD thoughts into some sort of coherent review.I have been reading a lot of 'serious' mystery/thriller books lately, with very disappointing twists and turns that leave me feeling unsettled in their poor execution. These books are generally by men, which is interesting, and generally involve womens' mental health issues. Liane Moriarty writes these books that always seem to be classed as 'women's fiction' (which is such a dumb genre title) but are SO MUCH MORE. This book is a mystery at its heart, following a family in Sydney whose matriarch suddenly disappears. Every twist and turn shocked me, the ending was deeply and perfectly satisfying, and every single loose end was tied.But alongside that, I got seven deep character studies of deeply relatable and invariably flawed individuals, all struggling to overcome their traumas, issues, and hurts. I found something to adore in each character, and something to hate too. Amy struck a particular chord with me as someone who suffers from anxiety.If you have ever discounted this type of book because it's a 'beach read', I would BEG you to reconsider!! It has every element of an excellent beach read in that it is compulsively readable, but its value is in its characters and its excellent plotting.LIANE MORIARTY FOR LIFE"
61,2.0,"Deciding between 2 and 2 1/2 Stars. Although there were some intriguing parts, the thought running through my head was...what a long strange trip this is. At times interesting characterizations of an unusual dysfunctional family, part mystery and an ending I could have done without, for me, this was not a particularly enjoyable book to read.Having really liked previous books of Liane Moriarty, I will always check out books by this author, hoping it will be a better fit."
62,5.0,"It is hard to be disappointed with a Liane Moriarty book if you’ve enjoyed her work before. There’s always a mystery, a personal struggle, big build ups and a legit ending. This book was all that I expected (and more) to the very end. The characters are well written, making each one seem like someone you personally know! I loved learning about the Delaney family. Two retired tennis instructors who are willing to bring a stranger into their home. I loved following their four suspicious children who are working together to make sure their parents are still making sound decisions. When Mrs Delaney suddenly goes missing, the hunt is on to find out the ‘where and why’. This is a wonderfully written story – You don’t even notice how long the book is until you’re finished. Liane Moriarty doesn’t disappoint!Side note: Am I the only one that saw the Savannah character as Keeley from Ted Lasso? 😂😂"
63,5.0,"Yes, it was long and slow. Yes, some parts seemed redundant, even ridiculous. Yes, the characters were definitely unlikeable. And yes, I don't care.Even with all those boring parts and annoying characters, it was still million times better than most of the books on my shelves. Liane Moriarty is the queen of characterization and family drama."
64,5.0,"“Accept nothing. Believe nothing. Check everything”I might be slightly biased since Liane Moriarty is one of my favourite authors and I will read and love everything she writes by default, but this was exactly what I was expecting from this book. There is just something so comforting when an author is capable of delivering a new book that is both similar and consistent with the style of their previous work but also, somehow, different and original, that just makes me feel like revisiting an old friend. I couldn't wait to read this one, and it did not disappoint. It's definitely not my favourite among her books, but some of the characters of this one (I love how Liane Moriarty writes female characters) are absolute favourites. If you are a fan of this kind of books, I absolutely recommend it! :)Note: I never read a book that dealt with tennis as a sport before. For some reason, I found that books about football, rugby, lots of other stuff are much more common (maybe due to the popularity of those sports)... but never tennis. It was refreshing! I know next to nothing about it and it got me so curious I am going to watch a match right now! :P"
65,5.0,"Apples Never Fall marks the return of the queen of the domestic-based psychological thriller, set in Sydney, Australia, this new slow-burn page-turner is a deliciously sinister story that unfolds when a seemingly idyllic family are put under the spotlight as their matriarch suddenly disappears. Joy and Stan Delaney met on the tennis tournament circuit half a century ago when they were both champion tennis players and have now been married for 50 years. They recently sold their successful and well-regarded business, The Delaney Tennis Academy, which became their passion, in order to retire peacefully. They are seen as a happy and contented couple by those who know them, but discontent has started to rear its ugly head. Even though they were frequently guilty of prioritising the game of tennis over both the health of their marriage and their children's wellbeing, now their four adult children - bohemian Amy, passive Logan, flashy Troy, and migraine-suffering Brooke - are grown, Joy often finds herself yearning for them to have grandchildren to enrich her life. One September evening a young woman shows up on the Delaneys' doorstep; they had never seen her before, but she informs them her name is Savannah, claims to be a victim of domestic abuse and with her injuries on full show the Delaneys have no reason not to believe her. Joy and Stan both welcome her into their home due to feeling sorry for her and her awful situation, but a temporary stay soon turns into a permanent one. Although Savannah pulls her weight in the house by doing chores such as cooking and cleaning, it isn't long before the Delaney’s children become suspicious about her sketchy behaviour as she seems far too relaxed and at home in their parents’ home, and they suggest that it's high time she moved on. Then suddenly, on February 14, 2020, Valentine's Day of all days, Joy vanishes and the last text she ever sent to her children had been so muddled, incoherent and tampered with by autocorrect to even begin to decipher what Joy had been trying to say.It soon becomes apparent to the Delaney children that their father is acting extremely suspiciously and he refuses to acknowledge that anything is wrong despite the love of his life being missing, and before long the police begin thinking along the same lines. Who is Savannah? Where exactly is Joy? And is Stan the one responsible for her disappearance? This is a compelling, engrossing and utterly masterful domestic thriller that is a character-driven narrative, and not only features plenty of thrills, twists and reveals but also has a deeper emotional side to it too. It's an irresistible and darkly delicious treat that takes readers behind the closed doors of seemingly tranquil suburbia as Moriarty expertly peels away the layers of a family to reveal heartfelt truths, deeply felt wounds and moments of humanity with her signature wit and expert observational powers. She has once again created a compulsively complicated and messy family dynamic. I just love how she uses the disappearance of a parent as a catalyst to unearth decades-long, unresolved issues within a family, but somehow does it all with biting wit, humour and ultimately hope. Highly recommended."
66,4.0,"Although I haven't read all of Liane Moriarty's books, I always enjoy her titles when I do pick them up and this one was no exception. In a way, this is testament to her writing, as this is about a tennis family, a sport which I find deadly dull. Stan and Joy Delaney are retired now, but were well known for running a tennis school, in which they had a lot of success - including creating one world famous player, Harry Haddad, who dropped Stan, rather unexpectedly, as his coach, before going on to success. Stan and Joy are quite bored by retirement and Joy is hoping that one of her four, adult children, will provide her with a grandchild soon - but there is little hope of that. Amy is the eldest and known to have had her mental health struggles, while sister, Brooke, the youngest, has separated from her husband and her time is taken up by her new physiotherapy practice. The sons are Troy, a divorced, successful businessman, and teacher, Logan who has also split up with his long term girlfriend. One night, a young woman, named Savannah, turns up at Stan and Joy's house and bangs at the door. She claims to have left her apartment after an incident with her boyfriend and chose their house at random, unsure what to do, or where to go. Joy, full of maternal love, takes her in and they offer her a spare room. Before the Delaney children know where they are, Savannah has moved in, but where did she come from, what are her motives and was her arrival really by chance? When Joy goes missing, the storyline moves between past and present, including the investigation into what happened to Joy, who sent a text to say she was going 'off grid,' but suspicion in the neighbourhood is running wild.The characters in this book are excellently written. I liked the interactions between the Delaney siblings and I enjoyed Savannah, who suspiciously quickly makes herself indispensable, but whose motives are obviously suspect. Stan and Joy are also well written, as are the various people who knew them - many of whom can't help wondering how perfect their marriage really was? I have to say that the characters worked better for me than the plot, but, overall, a really enjoyable read. I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, for review. "
67,4.0,"I enjoyed this one more than the last she wrote, but I did spend a bit of time wondering who was going to play who in the inevitable streaming adaptation! "
68,5.0,"Liane Moriarty is like a modern Jane Austen. — me OK, so already I need to fess up because the opening quote has been watered down. When I was trying to describe how much I loved this book to my husband, the phrasing was closer to: ""Liane Moriarty doesn't get enough fucking respect. She's like a goddamn Jane Austen of our time.""However it is expressed, the sentiment is real. I've written before about how, after discovering my love for Liane Moriarty's novels, I had to confront my bias against what I had assumed were shallow and fluffy stories about women. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Liane has been writing about the lives, relationships and longings of dozens of contemporary women — exactly what Miss Jane had been trying to do during her lifetime. Why is that automatically considered less important than what a man feels or does? Why are novels about women derided as ""chick lit,"" when novels with similar themes that have a man as a protagonist receive more critical acclaim and media attention?It helps to recognize how much misogyny and sexism there is in American culture, and how toxic it can be when you've lived in it for more than 40 years. Sadly, the logical extension of such sexism is that the publishing industry is dismissive of and condescending toward female writers, and that bias can unintentionally infect readers. You may have noticed that I've mentioned how much I love Liane's books, but I haven't said a single thing about the plot of ""Apples Never Fall."" That's because I think this book is more fun to read without having anything spoiled -- it's a clever story filled with clever people, and there are treasures to discover in the text. The richness of the dysfunctional family at the heart of the book reminded me of Jonathan Franzen's ""Corrections"" — which is rather appropriate because I used to complain about how much hype his books got.*Anyway, if you love a good epic novel about family, I heartily recommend this Liane Moriarty work. I listened to it on audio, performed by the marvelous Caroline Lee. And I hope Liane keeps writing stories about women for a long, long time.*Note: Regarding the media hype, my husband and I like to joke that Jonathan Franzen doesn't write about family, he writes about AMERICA. **ahem**"
69,4.0,"So....this was going to be a 5 star review. But. Unfortunately, she kinda blew the ending in my opinion. If I'm being completely honest, the advanced readers copy that I receieved is 464 pages and if they wanted me to tell the truth, I think pages 433-464 should have been completely scrapped and rewritten because the ending didn't serve the first 432 pages well imho. I loved the book. I think Apples Never Fall is honestly Liane Moriarty doing what Liane Moriarty does best. It's riveting fiction. An absolutely heart pulsing, page turning, full hearted novel with a huge cast of diverse characters with different personalities. It's what she is GREAT at. I love her writing style, and it works beautifully in this book: a story about a family of tennis professionals, the mother and father retired coaches, and their children, whose lives are interrupted by a bruised and bloody woman showing up on the Delaneys doorstep one night, and in a separate timeline many months later, Mrs. Delaney is missing. I was hooked from the very first chapter. I haven't wanted to put it down all week even though I've worked crazy hours and haven't had time to read, because like I said, it is Liane at her finest tackling some incredibly complex topics like the longevity of marriage and divorce and eating disorders and many more and in addition, the characters she has assembled are just stunning and you begin to root for them and want to know what really happened to Joy Delaney. I think the ending just didn't serve the book well and left a lot to be desired. As much I loved it, and I'm still highly recommending it, don't take me for granted, it's a solid 4.5, I'm taking away a star because the ending bugged me. 4 ⭐️ "
70,3.0,"I kept wishing something would happen, and 500 pages, about 20 hours of reading later, there was still very little!Positives - I loved the cover, I loved Moriarity's character development - the intricate sibling relationships, and ...well, that would be about it! Negatives - I really missed the humour, quirkiness and intrigue of her other novels. Stan and Joy's not-so-perfect marriage felt mundane and overwritten. The scenarios felt laboured and at times ridiculous, with bizarre side tangents that had me wondering what and why they were included in the book. This continued to the end with what seemed to be a random 30 page Covid mention at the end.I did complete the novel because I wanted to know what happened to Joy and how Savannah fitted into the Delaney family. However, once I got to the end, I realised I could have read the first 100 and last 100 pages and saved myself a whole lot of reading time!"
71,1.0,"Liane Moriarty has written two very good books---The Husband's Secret and Big Little Lies. Since Big Little Lies was published, she's written three mediocre/terrible books. While not quite as bad as Nine Perfect Strangers, Apples Never Fall is definitely up there as one of her worst books. For starters, there are a lot of pages wasted on discussions of migraines, anxiety, and tennis. I suffer from migraines and I love tennis, but these sections left me bored and skipping pages. How many times do you have to hear how great Stan and Joy are at playing doubles? Or how one of their daughters (whose name I've already forgotten) has to sit in a dark room when she has a migraine? In fact, none of the characters was engaging or sympathetic, least of all Joy, who we're supposed to be worried about because she's missing. Ultimately, the mystery and this book, are a big letdown."
72,2.0,"""Christina shot him a look. His eyes danced. She bowed her head and squeezed the bridge of her nose while she considered the absurdity of this case.""When I was offered this advance copy I was so excited but coming towards the end of this book I felt that absurd really is the sum of it. The jumping in time is tedious and I can only hope when the story is inevitably sold to Netflix for a mini series starring Nicole Kidman in yet another ensemble cast that this element is cut away. It is frankly done to death and not clever anymore. There's a twist at the end because of course there is. COVID is shoehorned in to be vaguely topical.Maybe this will work for the constant churn of television but as a reader I'm just so bored with it."
73,3.0,"*www.onewomansbbr.wordpres.com*www.facebook.com/onewomansbbr**3.5 stars**Apples Never Fall by Liane Moriarty. (2021). From the outside, the Delaneys appear to be an enviably contented family. Former tennis coaches Joy and Stan are still winning tournaments and now that they've sold the family business they can learn to 'relax'. Their 4 adult children are busy with their own lives, and while it could be argued they never quite achieved their destinies, no-one says it out loud. But now Joy has disappeared and her children are re-examining their parents' marriage and family history. Is her disappearance related to their mysterious house guest from last year? Or were things never as rosy as they seemed? I found this one alright. It was waaay too long, which a lot of reviewers are saying and I totally agree with. I kind of feel like this has been written with a TV series in mind because it just dragged in places and had unnecessary chapters, but I can see how it would work for a media adaption. To be fair, I feel like I judge this author a bit harsher than some other authors - because I think some of her earlier works are brilliant and so I've been a bit disappointed with the last couple as they haven't been as good (in my humble personal opinion). There were things I enjoyed with this one: the realistic sibling relationships, the concept of retirees being bored after retiring, the family dramas. I don't mind tennis but I got over the constant mention of it (maybe if the book was shorter I wouldn't have haha). Overall: I have no doubt that this book will be just as popular as all of the author's others, I think it was enjoyable enough but certainly not the author's best."
74,3.0,"*https://mrsbbookreviews.wordpress.com3.5 starsSydney based author Liane Moriarty is a household name. With eight published novels under her belt, record breaking sales figures and worldwide publication rights to her books, Liane Moriarty is an Australian success story. Moriarty’s latest novel has been highly anticipated by her huge fan base. Apples Never Fall is a suburban mystery tale that sees Moriarty untangle a set of complex family issues, tensions and heartache with her unique blend of satire and critical observation.Meet the Delaneys. The matriarch and patriarch of this enviable family are both well regarded tennis coaches. With their family business now off their hands, this couple plan to relax and take things easy. Joy and Stan know their adult children no longer need their help, despite their disappointments in life. The Delaneys are issued with a big shock when Joy goes missing. This kick starts a strong and critical look into the state of Joy’s marriage to her husband Stan. Why did Joy disappear, what stresses was she under and who was the mysterious visitor to the family home last year?Well known media outlets such as the Washington Post and The Australian have lined up to throw their support behind Moriarty’s work. Apples Never Fall will have many readers across the globe lining up to purchase a copy of this novel by the much-loved author. I will admit to being one of the many legions of fans who secured a copy of this book as soon as it was made available. I went into Apples Never Fall with quite high expectations and although I enjoyed elements of Moriarty’s new release, it isn’t my favourite novel of the author’s collection.I really did appreciate the premise and initial set up of Apples Never Fall. I had a good feeling about Moriarty’s new release from the opening. I was really excited about the prospect of delving into another promising page turner from Liane Moriarty. I have to be brutally honest and admit that it took a long time for me to click this one and I’m not sure if I truly connected to Apples Never Fall. There were moments of pure entertainment, brilliance and interest, but I did feel I checked out in parts, which seemed unusual for me, especially as I am a fan of Moriarty’s work. Moriarty spends a significant amount of time on background and character analytics. Apples Never Fall is well written and it does contain Moriarty’s trademark blend of wit, humour and domestic relations issues. This time around there is a gentle mystery and possible crime, which added something extra to the tale. I think Moriarty did work hard to tie things up conclusively as this was a rather long and complex family drama.The main game plan of Apples Never Fall is the sense of drama when it comes to family relations. With a focus on marriage, relationships, siblings, power, status, social issues, personal interests, truth, pressure, dysfunction, expectations, destiny and turmoil, Apples Never Fall is a full-bodied piece. Tennis (unfortunately not my favourite sport) features quite significantly in this novel and some of these parts did go over my head! But Moriarty weaves in a slight mystery thread through the full utilisation of her switching time periods and perspectives format, which I appreciated.A melting pot of family conflicts, life pressures, personal grievances and general struggles define the latest release from Liane Moriarty. Apples Never Fall is a great pick for contemporary fiction readers.*Thanks extended to Pan Macmillan for providing a free copy of this book for review purposes.Apples Never Fall is book #85 of the 2021 Australian Women Writers Challenge"
75,3.0,"This was my first Liane Moriarty book and I was really looking forward to it, I thought the story line was a great one a family saga that takes in a family of six who are all very different which is the way it normally is, families have their ups and downs but it seems that the Delaney family had a lot that was one day going to cause a lot of problems, especially when a stranger knocks on the door of retired tennis coaches Stan and Joy.The Delaney’s have been married nearly fifty years and have retired from running their Tennis School, they are very popular amongst the community people are envious of the love they shared, top notch on a tennis court even at seventy and sixty nine years of age and retirement should be thoroughly enjoyable years but somehow it is not what Joy thought it would be.There are four Delaney children Amy, Logan, Troy and Brooke all were very good at tennis growing up as you would expect with the parents they had but all have chosen different paths in life and they also have lots of ups and downs but Joy is hopefully going to get grandchildren.One cool night a strange young woman knocks on their door, it is late and she is injured and Joy and Stan are more than happy to help and soon Savannah has wormed her way into the family, but does she have a secret agenda or is she really as needy as she claims.All four Delaney children are not at all happy with the Savannah living with their parents even though she is doing a lot for them and their relationship with their parents becomes a little strained and when Joy goes missing, Savannah is gone as well and things are not looking good for Stan, and his kids are divided on their thoughts as to what happened.This story takes in a lot about families, their different personalities, their happiness and sadness, all the emotions that make a family and the way they all cope together and the pressure to do the best you can in life when the push to do that can come close to child abuse. I sadly found it very slow especially in the beginning of the story, there are so many characters to get to know, but it is also a story that compelled me to keep reading because I needed to know what happened.My thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for my copy to read and review"
76,4.0,"There are no bad apples in this author bushel of books.I really enjoyed this, especially because it had a similar feel to Big Little Lies in the way the story unfolded.We have a family of winners – tennis is in their blood - it shaped the way they are today, the good, the bad and the ugly. Now that Joy’s 4 children are grown and out of the house she and Stan are struggling to adapt to the life of retirees. And then one night a stranger comes knocking on their door and things will never be the same.Moriarty captures the turmoil of sibling rivalry and marital struggles so well and the mystery part (something I don’t always find appealing in a book) was kept light, almost as an afterthought to the story.The very ending was slightly unnecessary, but this is another of those books that’s very easy to recommend if you are in the mood for a light read with a solid story."
77,5.0,"If you enjoyed ""We Are the Brennans"", you'll love this twisty family drama set in Australia!I have read several Liane Moriarty novels and her writing style is very readable and highly entertaining. I loved how she set up the story and allowed the various family members to chime in with their thoughts about one another. Each has affection for the others but that doesn't mean they get along or hold back any punches. Their quirks would be both endearing and certainly crazy making too.The publishers blurb gives you all the information you need to get started and sharing the twists would ruin the surprises. A few I guessed but the way in which the story lines connected was masterful. I waffled between a 4 and 5, because some of the story seemed a tad unbelievable but Moriarty is so skillful I couldn't round down to the 4. While this may not be memorable, it certainly delivered a mystery, suspense and fun to boot."
78,5.0,Thank you Queen Liane. Exactly what I needed. Loved. 
79,4.0,"I was very excited about reading this book as I really have enjoyed other books by this author.In this book Joy and Stan Delaney have a long marriage and have now retired from running their own tennis school. They have four adult children, Amy, Logan, Troy and Brooke, each trying to find their own way in the world.When Joy suddenly and inexplicably goes missing, it starts to look as though Stan may be responsible for her disappearance.The story is told in two time lines, now with the police investigation and six months or so prior when Joy is coming to grips with retirement and lack of grandchildren.There are some funny and heart warming moments in this. Central to the story is tennis and what a competitive sport it is. The whole Delaney family sharing this sense of competition and oneupmanship. I think for me it could have been a five star read, except for that last chapter which to me detracted and was completely unnecessary.I am happy to recommend this book. Thank you Pan McMillan and NetGalley for the opportunity to review this digital ARC."
80,4.0,"Apples Never Fall is exactly what you’d expect of a Moriarty novel: perfectly paced and totally readable, with town gossip and parallel timelines that keep you guessing. There’s a cast of characters bound together, but each harbouring their own secrets – secrets a nosy detective is determined to uncover. If you’re a fan of town gossip and barely-founded assumptions, this is the summer read for you.My full review of Apples Never Fall can be found at Keeping Up With The Penguins."
81,5.0,"I absolutely enjoyed every bit of this story! It's been a while since an audio book was so good that I found extra things to do so that I could keep listening. The narrator for this one is excellent. If you enjoy audio books I would highly recommend consuming this one because Caroline Lee did a bang up job that made this story that much more enjoyable. The humor in this is subtle and awesome and I even found myself tearing up a bit in a couple of places which was so surprising. Excellent story with really good characters, a plot that unfolds well, and excellent narration. Full review to come. ***I received an ALC from Libro.fm in exchange for an honest review.***Where you can find me:•(♥).•*Monica Is Reading*•.(♥)•Twitter: @monicaisreadingInstagram: @readermonicaGoodreads Group: The Black Bookcase "
82,3.0,"Apples Never Fall works really well as a family drama- a family where tennis was always the focus even though the kids ultimately go in different directions- and where the familial relationships are all knife edge. Then Mum disappears and things start looking a bit dark.I'm a huge fan of Liane Moriarty but this one lacked her usual BOOM. The mystery element was hugely predictable and some of it felt a bit forced. I really enjoyed the siblings as a group dynamic, in fact their bickering love was the highlight of this for me.It is good but whereas her previous books have had that edgy feel and that really engaging sense of crazy, Apples Never Fall doesnt have any of that in my opinion. In fact it's such a straightforward process from A to B to me it felt like another author This probably feels like a negative but it's not so much negative as different. This is a really good book but I miss the madness."

""There was no such thing as a nice, ordinary, happily married couple.""

 Apples Never Fall is another winning exploration of relationships by Liane Moriarty. As is the norm for this author, approximately 90% of this book is character development, but with Moriarty, this is a good thing. I say it with every book she writes: it's as if she has lived these lives herself. Every nook and cranny of these people have been documented in a relatable way. Readers understand them, even the bad parts, and take away life lessons. I just love her writing! Check it out.Note: My only complaint (and why 4 stars instead of 5) is that Moriarty incorporated the pandemic in the ending. I understand authors want to document this period of time, but reading is my escape and I don't want the real-life reminder.The audiobook is a joy to listen to, with an outstanding performance by Caroline Lee. Her deep Australian accent gets me everytime! My favorite quote:""It starts out small. You put up with little things in a relationship and then the little things gradually get bigger."""
84,3.0,"So much emotional violence written in this family drama. Don't expect a thriller. Unfortunately, I found the characters unlikeable and the story overwritten. 2.5/3"
85,5.0,"For the longest time Liane Moriarty has been one of my favourite Aussie authors.   After being mildly disappointed by Nine Perfect Strangers I was both excited and a teeny bit nervous about her latest title.   Would it meet my typically high expectations for a Liane Moriarty novel or might I fail to gel with this one too?  I'm thrilled to report I thoroughly enjoyed Apples Never Fall and felt it was a terrific return to what she does so very well.  Contemporary Australian fiction; flawed yet loveable characters who seem so realistic; high drama with a bit of a twist; something to tug at the heartstrings all wrapped up with a great denouement.    What more could I have hoped for.The novel revolves around the Delaney family. Joy and Stan have tennis in their blood.   They've played competitively their whole lives, and they've shared their passion for tennis with hundreds of kids through their tennis coaching school.   Their four adult children, Amy, Logan, Troy and Brooke were each highly succesful junior players on the  Australian cicuit.    Joy and Stan seemingly have the perfect marriage but scratch the surface and perhaps this family is not as perfect as they seem.     When Joy goes missing after an argument with Stan there is plenty of reason for looking closer not just by the police but neighbours and social acquintainces all weigh in on the topic.      The thing I loved most was the way Moriarty completely nailed the family dynamics, the intracies and interplay between siblings, the way Joy knew her children - the facade they choose to portray to the world versus their insecurities, their vulnerabilites and their motivations.   I was only part way in when I started recommending this book to family and friends.   It only got better from there,  finished strong and I have no hesitation in recommending Apples Never Fall.   My sincere thanks to Macmillan Australia and NetGalley for the opportunity of reading this digital ARC in exchange for an honest review which it was my absolute pleasure to provide."
87,4.0,"The Delaneys are a tennis family institution. Perfectly competitive and athletic there are 4 amazing children and two parents with a loving marriage.At least that is what everyone thinks until the mother, Joy Delaney goes missing.This is Moriarty at her best as she slowly pulls the seams on perfection and we are able to study the human beings that are flawed and full of secrets. This book is really hard to put down, and as I got closer to the end I had no idea what was going to happen and changed my mind several times on how the mystery may be solved.If like me you were thoroughly disappointed with Nine Perfect Strangers, don't let it put you off starting this one. It is a great read!Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for providing me with an advanced reader copy in exchange for an honest review."
88,1.0,Soooo slow ... I’m surprised by the great reviews . I was very disappointed
89,1.0,"***MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD***Gotta talk about the reveal. How absolutely ridiculous, every single thing wrapped up perfectly. Joy decided on a whim to go on a three week retreat with a scam artist? She texted her kids about it without her glasses on? The note was held up by a poorly designed magnet and then it was eaten by the dog? The suspicious rolled up carpet taken to the car in the dead of night by her husband was because he wanted to surprise her with new timber flooring?? Her beloved shirt was innocently used to clean up blood then it was stolen from the bin by a cat?? Then the cat buried it in the woods behind their house???? Oh and some dude stole her bike and then died in a car accident?????? Like what. C'mon. It was so perfect I actually thought maybe when the cops came to arrest Stan that ""Joy"" was in fact Savannah, impersonating her after Stan killed Joy -- maybe Savannah was taking cash to cover it up, since they looked like mother/daughter and Savannah was apparently a savant at picking up mannerisms or whatever? Bah. What a joke. And what the heck was going on with the whole Haddad family!? And why were the two grandmothers stressed so much?? And who gives a fuck if Grant is domineering and Claire wants a baby? I could barely keep these kids and the partners straight. Literally there were so many unnecessary characters: a guy Joy kissed 20 years ago, one kid's ex-wife's mum, the Uber driver, the child of the friend from Denmark or something. And for the love of God, I don't read fiction to hear more about COVID. Whew. That was longer than I meant it to be. Sorry."
90,5.0,"Definitely one of my favourite books so far this year. The Delaney's appear to have the perfect family. Joy and Stan are former tennis coaches but in retirement, they have sold the family tennis coaching business they ran since they married. They have four children, two boys and two girls, all grown and forming their own relationships and careers now. But as the story unfolds, it’s clear their lives haven't turned out quite how they wished. One day Joy disappears and the children begin to question their parents' perfect marriage and whether they had the lives they wished for either. No one seems to know where Joy went and when the children report her as missing, we see the mystery unfold.This was a mixture of both family drama and mystery. We get to see the history of the family as we go along and secrets are uncovered. A stranger is thrown into the mix and we question their involvement with the couple, along with the underlying tension with the children. It's so hard to articulate what I loved about this one so much, as it was a combination of little things. The writing was fabulous and I loved the contemplation of the couples' marriage. The secrets and history that comes with being together so long was so realistic and the story was told with such intimacy, interspersed with humour. While it was a slow burn, it was still one I found hard to put down and the way in which the author uncovered each detail was masterful. Such a brilliant novel🍏Thanks so much to Pan Macmillan Australia for this advance review copy."
91,4.0,"Simmering, cunning, and cleverly intricate!Apples Never Fall is a compelling, character-driven, domestic thriller that takes you into the lives of the Delaney family as they each grapple with sibling rivalry, enduring jealousy, resentments, and long-buried secrets when their matriarch disappears one day leaving behind only a garbled text message and a husband who seems suspiciously guilty of her murder.The writing is crisp and tight. The characters are envious, secretive, and troubled. And the plot told using a mixture of narrative, police interviews, and alternating timelines, before-and-after the incident is a mysterious tale full of well-timed twists, unforeseen surprises, red herrings, deception, insecurities, and a whole slew of quirky, eccentric personalities.Overall, Apples Never Fall is another addictive, astute, tragically comedic tale by Moriarty that highlights once again her innate ability to delve into all the messy psychological and emotional entanglements that exist between family members and is definitely worthy of its spot on everyone’s must-read list this fall.Thank you to Henry Holt and Company for providing me with a copy of this story in exchange for an honest review."
92,3.0,"I am beginning to think that Liane Moriarty truly hates people, or maybe she only hates the people she puts into her novels. Perhaps she just comes up with all of the traits she hates about the people she has to deal with in life and gets to write them into messed-up situations of despicability. Moriarty is one of the few in the contemporary genre who can pull a story with a large cast of leading narrators. However, in this case, it was too many voices and repeated events for me.Amy was my favorite of all of the Delaney's. The Tennis element was, of course, a fun addition. None of the family members seem to care much that Joy was missing and the constant story backend forth with the majority taking place in a present WITH Joy being active in it, made me not care either. Overall it was good, but not great. Liane still does an excellent contemporary novel, but this wasn't one of her shining gems for me. Solid 3 star."
93,3.0,I could not keep my interest in this book. It was so overly detailed it lost the plot. I gave up after 150 pages. 
94,4.0,"Okay, I admit to being a big Moriarty fan; I've read them all and enjoyed her quirky and complex characters, sparkling dialogue, edgy humor, and often dizzying plot twists, the exception being the disappointing The Husband's Secret-2 stars. My favorites remain Big Little Lies and What Alice Forgot. Apples Never Fall satisfied my usual expectations of her stories. My one criticism is that the middle third of the novel really drags with the accounts of the characters' woes, resentments, and blunders becoming tiresomely repetitious. The tempo and energy picks up again at Chapter 51, and the remainder of the story is sheer delight."
95,2.0,I feel super harsh giving this 2 stars but the more I sit with it the more unsettled I feel. The ending was so disappointing. It make the whole book feel like a waste of time. I'm so bummed :(
96,3.0,"Exactly what I expect from Liane Moriarty: a family drama that peels back all the layers below a perfect, outward veneer.The Delaneys are a tennis family. For thirty years, Joy and Stan ran a tennis club and coached youngsters to their potential, including their own four children. Now the tennis club is long sold and they're closing in on their 70's; it's time to slow down and enjoy their golden years... except Stan can't give up his obsession with the game, and Joy doesn't have any grandchildren on the horizon. One night, a young woman shows up at Joy and Stan's house with cuts and bruises on her face. She says her boyfriend hit her and she randomly knocked on their door for shelter. She doesn't want to involve the police, but a cup of tea and nice, long rest would be great! Savannah's plight is Joy's chance to use all that nurturing that's just going to waste; Stan just wants Joy to be happy. Before they know it, one night turns into a few; a few nights into a week.When Joy goes missing a few months later and Savannah is nowhere to be found, the case becomes the talk of the town. Who was Savannah really, and was the Delaneys' house really chosen at random? The more everyone conjectures, the more the Delaneys take a look at themselves and each other, coming to terms with long-simmering issues that have never seen the light of day.The mystery itself was mediocre, but the worst section was the overlong denouement in which the Covid pandemic is mentioned out of nowhere. Once the reveal/climax was over, it should have just wrapped up (view spoiler)[Savannah's story (hide spoiler)] and that's it. As ever, the best part of any Liane Moriarty novel is her dissection of close-knit bonds, and her extraordinary way of describing the mundane."
97,4.0,"Let me start by saying I have read ALL of Liane Moriarty's books...and I love them all too...And yes, this was another great read from one of my faves!It's a sprawling family drama with multiple characters and multiple story threads which I really enjoy. If you are looking for action then this isn't the book for you.There is plenty of 'he said, she said' and going back in time and exploring feelings along the way. Yes, there is a mystery and I wanted to know what happened but this book is about people (family specifically) not plot.This is not perfect or my favourite from this author, but I really enjoyed it and I think it will probably grow on me with a reread. I did love the family dynamics and the offbeat humour that Liane Moriarty always offers."
98,5.0,"A Liane Moriarty novel is a treat to be savored slowly. Apples Never Fall is told from several points of view, and the story moves back and forth in time, slowly revealing the history of the Delaneys, a competitive tennis family. Moriarty's writing is so crisp and true, every Dulaney is a fully rounded person, with strengths we admire, and weakness we understand. Even relatively minor characters, such as the widow next door, or the young policewoman investigator, are real people we'd like to know better. This is a story about families, about how those close to us see both the best and the worst of us. It's about how our loved ones know the secrets we hide from the world, and still love us, in spite of, or maybe because they know us so well. It's also about another family, one not so fortunate as the Delaneys, but it would spoil the mystery if I told you about them."
99,3.0,"An entire family's dirty laundry is carefully washed by hand in this endlessly meandering book. The ""present"" plotline is that Joy Delaney disappears and her four children and husband don't know what to make of it. Eventually she is reported missing and detectives show up. The ""past"" plotline is a year back, when a strange girl just happened to fall upon Joy and her husband late one evening. They let her in and let her stay, to the grown-up children's chagrin. Who is this Savannah and what does she really want? And what really happened to Joy?If you, like me, are at the start of the book and wondering whether it can possibly be worth it, then the answer is ""yes"". Not unequivocally so perhaps, because the story meanders and loops and repeats - but still, you do get into it eventually. Definitely not a favorite book of the author by any means, but interesting enough for the plot to linger a bit."
100,2.0,"Surprisingly tedious. I had hopes at the beginning, made me laugh a few times, and there is a nice mysterious feeling, but it just dragged on and on and on and the characters got more and more annoying until I just wanted to get to the end...will it be bleak and dark or sunny and happily-ever-after? I actually think that whichever one it turned out to be would have made me roll my eyes by that point. Also, I hate tennis. Couldn't relate to all the tennis stuff."
101,1.0,"DNF at 85%. I gave it its chance. I waited for the twists and the drama. This will not win me over. Literally I cannot understand why anyone would give this more than 3 stars, let alone 5 and the other rave reviews its getting. It's so BORING - the family drama is the most Rich People Problems I have ever seen, and it doesn't get dramatic at ALL besides people bitching at each other over NOTHING. It's not dramatic, its annoying that no one has any communication skills. It's also not a mystery at all. Oh the mysterious girl isn't who she says she is? And the reveal is BORING. It doesn't even do much either! Did the husband kill her? I don't care! They are annoying and its not even an interesting mystery that we're following, its just PAGES and PAGES of flashbacks about some childhood event that no one can get over! This needed a serious edit and a real plot, because all I got out of it was people bitching at each other and refusing to admit any fault "
102,5.0,"I had never read Liane Moriarty before, but if this book is any indication, her reputation for writing engrossing cliffhangers is well-earned.Apples Never Fall gives us the Delaney family, Stan and Joy Delaney and their four grown children: Amy, the oldest and artsy one; Troy, a highflying businessman very proud of his wealth and losing no opportunity to flaunt it; Brooke, the youngest, a businesswoman who has not had much success in the romance department; and Logan, the disheveled teacher with a heart of gold. This is, in fact, a family saga that turns into a mystery and a bit of a thriller before the end.Moriarty is very adept at giving us an in-depth portrait of each of these family members. That, I felt, was one of the book's strengths and something that I really liked about it. She describes each of their backstories of experiences along with their struggles and mistakes along the way. In spite of their weaknesses and mistakes, the reader gains a real empathy for each of them. One feels that one knows them. They might be our neighbors. They might even be our family.The Delaneys are famous in the tennis world. Both Joy and Stan are former Australian tennis stars and after their playing career ended, they started a tennis academy where they instructed young players, including their own children, for years. They had hopes that one or more of their children might someday play at Wimbledon, but they were disappointed in that. Although talented, none of them had sufficient talent or desire to be such a star.Their real prodigy was Harry Haddad who went on to become a Grand Slam champion. As a student at the academy, he was a rival of the younger Delaneys, both as a player and for their father's affection. But Harry eventually broke Stan's heart. At seventeen, he left Harry as a coach and signed on with someone else. It was that coach who got him all the way to the Grand Slam. Now it is several years later and Harry had retired from tennis, but he's decided to try for a comeback and he is about to release his memoir. Meanwhile, Joy and Stan are retired after selling their tennis academy. Joy will soon turn seventy, and Stan is already in his seventies. They are both a bit bored and at loose ends since retirement. Then something happens to change all that. A young woman turns up on their doorstep.Her name (she says) is Savannah and she's supposedly running from an abusive boyfriend and she does have some physical injuries to support her story. Open-hearted Joy takes her in, gives her one of her children's old rooms, and she becomes a guest of the family. This guest though certainly earns her way. It seems she is an excellent cook and soon Joy and Stan are eating better than ever before.Of course, this idyllic situation doesn't last. The Delaneys learn something about Savannah's background that makes them suspicious of her. Stan and Joy have a serious argument and shortly afterward, Joy disappears. Has Stan done away with her? That seems to be the consensus opinion. Or has Savannah done away with her? Were Savannah and Stan having an affair?There are no apparent clues and as the disappearance lengthens into weeks, everyone fears the worst. Red herrings abound. Still, no body has been found. Even so, the two detectives investigating the case prepare to arrest Stan for murder. Moriarty builds the suspense layer upon layer until we are sure that some truly horrible fate has befallen Joy. And then we learn... But, no, you'll have to read the book to find out!I enjoyed this book from the first page to the last. I particularly liked the character of Joy and found it easy to identify with her. And the lessons of the book seem to be that, yes, we all make mistakes, and sometimes we betray those we love, either intentionally or unintentionally. Love is not always easy but it is built upon our willingness to accept mistakes and to forgive. To forgive others and to forgive ourselves. That's not a bad thing for a novel to demonstrate."
103,5.0,"Unfolding from multiple viewpoints, Apples Never Fall by Liane Moriarty is an engrossing, intimate domestic drama.Sixty-nine year old Joy Delaney hasn’t been seen or heard from for a week before her four adult children, Amy, Troy, Logan and Brooke, notice. Their father, Stan, has no good explanation for her absence, or the scratches on his face, and the siblings, aware things have been tense between their parents for some time, struggle to defend him when the police suspect he has murdered her. As the timeline moves between the present and the past, Moriarty unravels the complex dynamics of the Delaney’s, it’s disruption by a mysterious interloper, and the puzzle of Joy’s absence.Though the intrigue regarding Joy’s disappearance is central to the story, Apples Never Fall is a very much a character driven novel. I always appreciate how authentic and grounded Moriarty’s characters are, each with distinct and nuanced personalities. I found Joy’s frustrations, worries and hopes to be relatable, while Stan is more of a traditional patriarch. Their children, despite a rather extraordinary childhood, are fairly ordinary adults, with an interesting mix of strengths and flaws, accomplishments and regrets.As with most family’s, the Delaney’s relationships are a mix of love and rivalry, secrets and lies, resentments and guilt. I really liked the way in which Moriarty shows how each member has differing perspectives on the same incidents, and how that plays into how they define themselves, and each other. It’s with keen insight that Moriarty also explores a wide range of issues from empty-nest syndrome and domestic violence, to the pressures of elite sport, and the weight of family expectations. This is not a fast paced story, but there are plenty of surprises in Apples Never Fall. I’ve read more than a few complaints about the ending(s) of the novel (especially with its reference to the pandemic) but I thought there was a subtle and clever implication in it.Offering compelling characters, authentic emotion, and sharp wit, I found Apples Never Fall to be an entertaining, incisive and absorbing novel."
104,3.0,"Joy and Stan open their door to the injured young woman Savannah. Savannah is a total stranger and yet they let her stay in their home—for weeks. [Right—who does that? And this proves to be a bad idea? No kidding!] Oh yes, and Savannah lies---constantly. [Is anyone surprised?]Moriarty uses this premise to explore the family dynamics of the Delaney family—parents Joy and Stan; grown children Amy, Logan, Brooke, and Troy. This is a tennis family with a capital T. The parents taught tennis and all of the children played tennis as they were growing up. Stan was hoping that one of them would be talented enough to ‘go all the way’—but sadly, none of them did. Tennis-related metaphors abound in Moriarty’s writing.And then Joy goes missing. No one seems too concerned at first, but eventually the police are called in and the lead detective jumps to the conclusion that Stan has murdered her. Moriarty creates a bit of suspense here, but her real focus is on the family drama that unfolds with their mother’s disappearance. And what is the main family dynamic that she unearths here, that children are like apples that don’t fall far from the tree. Personalities have their origin in their genes and childhood experiences.While Moriarty’s characters are intriguing, I am not sure that I liked very many of them. Maybe Stan and Logan—and Stan took me awhile!"
106,5.0,"Intricate portrait of a family on a brink. Four adult children of a tennis obsessed parents, who went through some difficult times during their 50+ years of marriage. With elements of a crime thriller/missing persons mystery this works really well as a book about family, responsibilities, and mainly resentment and guilt. There is lots of unspoken pain from the past that surfaces and even though Savannah's revenge is far-fetched it is a gripping read and a valuable essay on relationships and family, sacrifices and mistakes. I liked it."
107,4.0,"I enjoyed this one from the beginning. There were ""clues"" placed throughout the book that I had completely missed. The then/now writing style worked for me. I like having small snippets of each character shown throughout the story, it keeps the mystery moving. There were plenty of times when some of those clues were revealed where I thought ""OH!"". I would definitely suggest this title to those who enjoy reading this author, now I just need to finish Nine Perfect Strangers by her, which I am also enjoying."
108,4.0,Review to come!
109,3.0,"Liane Moriarty is a talented and gifted writer however this was my least favorite of her novels. The first half of the book seems to drag for me. There was a bit too much drama in each of the character’s lives and the skeletal framework of tennis was so ever present-a bit too much for my taste. With all that being said, Liane Moriarty remains one of my favorite authors and her writing is always a pleasure. "
110,5.0,"ExcellentExcellent build to every little part of this story. I think it's her best one yet, with each character perfectly distinct, each clue dropped at the perfect time, and a perfect ending, along with a question. What if...?Very enjoyable."
111,5.0,took me awhile but I enjoyed this! nice and round you know? 
112,5.0,"I have mixed feelings when it comes to Liane Moriarty's books. Some of them I have loved, and others just weren't my cup of tea. So I went into reading Apples Never Fall with a sense of trepidation. However, this one was really interesting and kept me riveted throughout. The story started off with a lot of character buildup, which meant that each narrative went off on a lot of tangents and flashbacks. However, once I got to the part where Savannah first shows up, things started to smooth out more. She was an interesting addition to the family's drama throughout the story. I also enjoyed getting to know the siblings through each other's eyes, as well as through their own narratives. Troy had a really complex situation and I wanted to see how that would play out for sure. You really have to pay attention to the details in this story because certain things will have significance later on and you'll be wondering why you're experiencing deja vu when that happens. It felt anticlimactic toward the end, but I liked hearing how everything came together, and there were still other aspects I didn't expect. I don't really follow tennis much, but that aspect wasn't as overwhelming as I expected it to be. Overall, I enjoyed it more than some of Liane's previous novels, but it didn't surpass Big Little Lies.I heard this was optioned for TV, so it will be interesting to watch. In case the casting director needs some suggestions:Joy: Jenny AgutterStan: Anthony LaPagliaAmy: Charlotte RileyBrooke: Jessica Brown FindlayTroy: Max MinghellaLogan: Ben RobsonIndira: India de BeaufortSavannah: Juno TempleChristina: Tuppence Middleton

"
113,5.0,"This author never disappoints me. That's a sentence I don't get to write very often! Her characters are real, breathing entities who invite me to like and/or loathe them, and her plots are only slightly outlandish but in the most fun way. This book was a bit different in that the tone right from the beginning allowed me to remain unworried about the almost-unlikeable Joy, then pulled the rug out with that post-ending ending. Moriarty absolute aces dialogue - the best scene in the book is the adult siblings' conversation while they wait for Joy to finish wrangling and mangling Christmas dinner. It was so good I had to read it twice. Liane Moriarty has found the perfect recipe for a film-worthy novel - good characters, great dialogue, intriguing plot with a few gentle and not-so-gentle twists, lots of extraneous details that turn out to be crucial, and lots of threads that are tied up perfectly at the end - and she's dished it out again here. There are also a number of thoughtful comments, like the lovely passage where Joy and Stan remember a day in London differently, and Joy ruminates on the questionable value of accuracy as opposed to sentiment in our memories. BTW - the female equivalent of ""avuncular"" would be ""avauntular"" which would indicate the opposite quality. I've definitely been avauntular during the pandemic! One unsolved mystery though - why are there red apples on the cover when all the apples in the book are green?"
114,3.0,"3.5-3.75 stars Far and away better than her last book (9 perfect strangers was just dreadful!) but still missing that sparkle ❇️ I experienced in previous books.Overall this is a slow-to-moderate paced family drama. Around 63% it jumps up and becomes verrry interesting and thrilling 🤭 but then that aspect is over by 68% and slows back down to the family drama with a crawl to the finish. I would recommend this only if you like slow family dramas, the “mystery” aspect of this book is almost hardly present, it’s very much in the background with over 90% of the story being about this family and each persons “issues”I did like how the author used so many variations of narrators, including occasionally narrating from a waitress or other “stranger” POV SUMMARY: two timelines: “now” when 68yo mother has been “missing” for about a week and “then” which starts some months before her “disappearance” when a mysterious young woman showed up on the parents door step (this timeline works toward the now and the eventually sync up).The story mostly goes into the lives of the parents (missing mom and her husband, the dad) and their four adult children. One daughter is getting divorced and has started her own business, the other daughter has mental health issues, one son is also going through a breakup and the other son is wealthy and spending most of his time in America. There’s also the young woman who shows up; she is recently out of an abusive relationship and appears to have an eating disorder. The family is also a “tennis” family; all were stars at some point and then washed out. Dad was also a famous coach of sorts to many aspiring players.The “past” storylines reveal interesting bits about the family history — eg affairs, secrets, rivalries, and their unique forms of dysfunction. The past also recounts the months the young woman lived with the parents after turning up on their doorstep.The now mainly focuses on the mother being gone and the adult children wondering if “that girl” is behind it, but this timeline also discusses the problems each of the adult children have (eg sleeping with a flatmate, divorce)Most of the book takes place in the past storylines.By the end you get a very honest picture of a real family and know where mom went/what happened to her and who the mystery young woman really was and what connections she had to the family (it isn’t the usual answer). The end."
115,3.0,"You have suspicions that your father killed your mother. What would you do? For the Delaney family, the solutions aren’t clear cut. 𝗔𝗣𝗣𝗟𝗘𝗦 𝗡𝗘𝗩𝗘𝗥 𝗙𝗔𝗟𝗟 has a solid premise and eccentric family dynamics—there is a lot to like here!This is a light mystery/family drama with a large dose of quirkiness. I enjoyed the Delaney's ties to the competitive tennis world and the way each sibling forged their own path in life.With highly anticipated books my expectations run high. Clocking in at 480 pages (18+ hours on audio), this is a heavy hitter and I wonder if I would have enjoyed the pacing more if it was shorter. Even though this is a hefty book, the frequently shifting multiple POVs made me feel disconnected to the characters. I’m still not sure how I feel about the ending--the tone felt different and a bit disjointed from the first 400 pages of the book. I’ll be curious to see what you think!I enjoyed this one more than NINE PERFECT STRANGERS but not as much as some of Moriarty’s other well known titles. Liane Moriarty is undoubtedly a great storyteller and I’ll continue to read anything she writes!𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗡𝗚: 3.5/5 ⭐️(𝐼𝑡 𝑤𝑎𝑠 𝑓𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑙𝑦 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑 )𝗣𝗨𝗕 𝗗𝗔𝗧𝗘: September 14, 2021A big thank you To @henryholtbooks for a physical copy and fun swag bag as well as @librofm for an ALC."
116,2.0,This was a slog. It started off well enough but as soon as Savannah entered the picture I was a little less excited. I really hated her character. I also detest people who insert themselves into situations they have no right to but that's not why I didn't like the story. It just got way too stupid. And unnecessarily long. I love a good meaty book but this was a waste of paper and ink. The whole thing. Without giving spoilers I really can't go on but this was very disappointing just like the 9 strangers one. Sigh. I really loved her early books but these last were such duds. 
117,1.0,"I wanted to love this book as I have read great things by the author but this is 461 pages of lots about nothing. Yes, a dysfunctional family and a mom who disappears and the adult children struggling to be adults. Then she brings Covid into the last few chapters. It was a waste of time & $25. I’m not sure what others find riveting about Moriarty’s words in this book. Sadly disappointed. "
118,3.0,"3 1/2 starsPanic hits the perfect family when the mom disappears into thin air one day. The four grown kids come home to take care of dad only to find out that maybe all wasn't so grand at the Delaney household. Joy and Stan have run a successful tennis school, have a great marriage and still play doubles so no one understands it when Stan ends up as the murder suspect. The couple also have recently taken in a young woman who seems more than a little sketchy to the kids. There is family drama and secrets galore just like Liane Moriarty is known for. My thanks to the publisher for the advance copy."
119,4.0,"4.5 Stars!Another fascinating family drama from Liane Moriarty, I had to give it 4.5 Stars! SUMMARYJoy Delaney is missing! No one has seem her or heard from her in days. Her adult children finally decide to report her missing after not hearing from her in five days! When they start piecing together the events surrounding the last time she was seen, they realize she disappeared shortly after having a horrible fight with her husband Stan. And, to make matters worse, Stan has a big scratch mark on his face. Their children, Amy, Brooke, Troy and Logan are divided the subject of their dads innocence and on what they think actually happened to their mother. The story follows the police investigation as the entire community searches for Joy and it also jumps back in time laying out the background of the family dynamics, explaining exactly how the Delay family found themselves in this predicament. And, to add even more intrigue, there is was a mysterious stranger who wormed her way into Joy and Stan's home just months before Joys disappearance. WHAT I LOVEDI loved the way the family dynamic was laid out; all families are complicated and relationships ever changing, yet never changing. I loved they way Joy said she had been in and out of love with Stan many times throughout their marriage. It rings so true of all long lasting relationships. To make their family relationships even more complicated, Stan and Joy ran a tennis school. They trained many local children, but also their own very talented children. Having their parents as their tennis coaches added many layers of dysfunction to the Delaney children's relationship with their parents. It was both fascinating and relatable. The subplot of Savannah, the mysterious stranger, added an additional wild card to the story. I loved it. The plot itself was well thought out and quite well executed. It kept me guessing from the first page.  WHAT I DIDN'T LOVEA few things toward the end, within the resolution, were a little convoluted. Particularly the parts two pets played in with story. I don't want to spoil it and say too much but it felt a little cheap, cheesy and like a Disney tv show ending. OVERALLThe good far outweighed the cheesy for me. I recommend this book to any of my GR friends who love a good family drama with a bit of a mystery thrown in."
120,1.0,"Another negative review for this month. I hate that that is the case. This has not been a great reading month at all. I will make this brief.This is the second Liane Moriarty I've read, and since I've given her a second chance, this will be my last. I think I'll just stick with enjoying her shows, because I've come to the conclusion that her books aren't for me. And that's ok.This was another audiobook, but I feel like this wasn't the audiobooks fault, I just didn't like it. I felt it was long and rambling. I thought it was going to be about a wife and mother who went missing, with the children divided on if their father killed her or not. Instead, what I got was a boring book about tennis, and a very long and pointless back story. I felt there were more pointless conversations in this book from before their mother went missing than was necessary. I assumed it would all tie together at some point, and there would be a reason for it, but if there was, I somehow missed it. I wanted a story about the mother going missing, not about which child was best at tennis and which felt resentful because they weren't the best, and who was dating who and who was the favorite or felt they were the favorite. The whole time I was listening I wanted to scream ""what's the point?! I don't care!!""I know there are many people who really enjoyed this, so I would say if it sounds interesting to you, especially if you are a tennis fan, or you enjoy Ms. Moriarty then you should give this a try. I actually disliked this one more than ""The Husband's Secret, but I recognize her writing style, it just isn't for me. This is 1 star. It wasn't good. "
121,3.0,"What a hot mess, but better then Truly Madly Guilty! Didn’t bother with Nine Perfect Strangers, but decided to pick this one up as it was getting better reviews. This book lacked focus & was way too long. I even read another fiction book while still reading this one which is something I never do. That one I loved, but this one not so much!2.5"
122,2.0,Disappointing. A slow burner and quite a lengthy book with no real plot. Felt like a waste of time reading it as nothing exciting really happens! Didn’t like any of the characters and the heavy focus on tennis…snoozefest.
123,5.0,This was my 9th book by this author! I have liked everything except Nine Perfect Strangers. But I’m so glad I gave her another chance. Loved it! 
124,2.0,"Yikes, this book was too long and drawn out and the ending was out of place. "
125,2.0,"This book was so slow and long-winded. At nearly 500 pages, I feel like I’ve wasted so much time and energy constantly thinking something interesting was going to happen but it never did! The tension kept building but the result was completely anticlimactic and pointless! There was too much extra detail and side stories that were just a bit boring. Though well written and humorous at times, it was not worth me spending 3 weeks reading!! Regrets :( I usually really enjoy her writing but this one just missed the mark for me! "
126,3.0,"I loved Big Little Lies, and since then, I’ve been reading Liane Moriarty, hoping to find that interest again, but it didn’t happen. The intrigue of  Apples Never Fall  seems pretty far-fetched to me - an unknown young woman knocks at Joy and Stan’s door one night, she says her boyfriend hit her, and the elderly couple practically adopt her. Of course, this woman isn’t as innocent as she seems, but you already have guessed that. And when Joy disappears, it’s obvious that it is related to that woman. I thought about giving up on reading this novel, but then at the half of the book, I felt a spark of curiosity, and I kept on. Do I regret reading it? Well... the end almost made me throw my e-reader with frustration. I have read 500 pages for that? And in my humble opinion, the last chapters about the pandemic were totally unnecessary."
127,4.0,"I really enjoyed this book! From the first page I knew I would enjoy it! I LOVE a good family drama! This book is about four siblings and their parents, I couldn’t get enough! The writing immediately sucks you in and you really care for each family member! I found their personalities so interesting. I also thought this was so funny! I was laughing out loud constantly. I also really loved how you get perspectives from random people overhearing the siblings! It was so unique and such a fun thing to add to the story. There’s a mystery throughout the novel that’s really interesting and makes you want to find out what’s going on. It’s in the background of the story because the main focus is getting to know the characters.Favourite quotes:“Harry Potter would never hit a woman.”“Harry Potter deserved to feel fear and confusion because he was legally, morally and spiritually in the wrong.”"
128,4.0,"It’s family, mystery, drama, complex characters and relationships all in one. It’s a slow burn, the author not revealing too much at once but kept me turning the pages. The end got really interesting and I found myself reading for several hours- not able to put it down until I finished. I love Liane Moriarty books and this was another hit for me. "
129,5.0,"This is everything one could hope for from a new novel by Liane Moriarty. Her masterful storytelling brings chick lit to a whole new level. It is thoroughly enjoyable reading!I am so happy that I did not read the book blurb prior to starting this book. Everything was fresh and unexpected - which is exactly what you want.PS Of course, I had to Google the frog in boiling water…"
130,5.0,One of my favorites by this author!
131,3.0,"Genre: Domestic Fiction/MysteryPublisher: Henry Holt & CompanyPub. Date: September 14, 2021The four gorgeous red fruits on the book’s cover represent the four children of Stan and Joy Delaney, who founded a sought-after tennis academy. All their offspring, including themselves, are “almost” good enough to make it to Wimbledon. The family falls apart questioning each other when Joy disappears.Moriarty stumbles throughout this story. The family dynamics are interesting yet the plot is unbelievable. Especially at the end when all is boringly explained. And, we learn what the title is all about: the importance of parental love and guidance. Corny.I received this Advance Review Copy (ARC) novel from the publisher at no cost in exchange for an honest review.Find all my book reviews at:https://www.goodreads.com/review/list…https://books6259.wordpress.com/https://www.barnesandnoble.com/review…https://www.facebook.com/martie.neesr…https://twitter.com/NeesRecord\https://www.instagram.com/martie6947/https://www.amazon.com/"
132,5.0,"A woman goes missing, a police investigation ensues. Investigators, when talking with the 4 children and father, begin to unravel a secretive past incident—in which a female alleged victim of domestic violence shows up at the home of the woman and her husband, and begins to radically alter the dynamics of entire family—a few months prior. As the narrative cuts back and forth between the past and present, wildly different conclusions suggest themselves to the police. It’s also fascinatingly comprehensive in its psychological underpinnings. Every character has a B plot that intersects with one another, and ties into the A plot. But more than just being relevant and tying into it, the entire plot actually hinges on seemingly innocuous interactions that are further explored as the book progresses. It’s actually astounding how much everything matters and how well-crafted everything about this is and feels. The voice is so distinct and masterfully interweaves every person, even as it head hops and maintains a personable and curious gaze. The interconnected effects of subtle moments that land on the characters illicit a gamut of emotions and consequences. There are no easy answers and there are a lot of complex themes at work. People as contradictory creatures, displaying absolute love and horrid betrayal, characterized prismatically varied, depending on character point of view. The narrator is absolutely perfect in the audiobook too. I found it very affecting, enjoyable, and unique. "
133,4.0,(free audio review copy from Libro.fm) Excellent on audio! After the author’s last few books that didn’t wow me I was hesitant about this one. BUT it didn’t go the direction I worried it would and really did keep me guessing. Loved the family dynamics and how it all wrapped up. Narrator was the perfect fit for the story and setting.
134,5.0,"Another great story from this author. I always love how much you get to know her characters. I loved the family dynamics here. Sibling rivalries old and new, parent grievances, challenges of retirement. It had it all. The book jumped between present day and about 6 months prior as you try to solve the mystery of what happened to mom who has been missing for 2 weeks. I sort of took my time with this one and it was perfect for that. But whenever I wasn't reading, I was definitely curious about what was going on with that Delaney family. It's one of those books where you sort of start to think they are real people and you know them. I just love that."
135,3.0,"I was beyond excited to receive an ARC copy as I’m a big Liane Moriarty fan. Unfortunately, I felt this one didn’t quite match the calibre of her other books. There were aspects that I enjoyed – the interchanging timeline, the eccentric characters, the dysfunctional family drama, and of course unravelling the many secrets. However, it didn’t seem as refined as other Moriarty books I’ve read. It was long, the first half felt particularly slow with too much backstory on the characters which didn’t seem relevant. Things felt over explained – just a minor example but Brooke’s migraines were mentioned again and again which was a bit tiring, and Savannah’s story was a little too far-fetched. Finally, the inclusion of Covid seemed clunky and irrelevant. With Covid news dominating my social feeds, the radio, TV and papers I really don’t want to start seeing it in my books, that’s my escape from reality! I hate to be negative about anyone’s work but unfortunately, I didn’t enjoy this as much as I hoped."
136,5.0,"I loved this book and while I wanted to know what happened I also wanted the story to continue. This is a story that is about miscommunications. From spouses to children and friends The Delaney’s - Stu, Joy, Amy, Troy, Logan and Brooke - have always caught the eye of their neighbors. For their heights and their tennis talent. They’ve always been close and competitive. They fall well into the roles set forth by family but how well do they really KNOW one another. With Joy experiencing a loss of self and searching for a purpose other than being a wife and mother and her children searching for their place things sometimes get loss. When stranger Savannah shows up in the middle of the night and gives joy that attention secrets and the past come to the present. It’s only when Joy turns up missing that the family really starts to examine their place and their affect on one another. Part contemporary fiction with characters you love, part page turning thriller. Don’t miss this one come September Thanks to the publisher for an early read!!"
137,5.0,"""Apples Never Fall"" is the story of the Delaney family, a family of tennis players, and what happens when Joy Delaney, who is sixty-nine, goes missing. Her husband, Stan, becomes the chief suspect in her possible murder, and her four adult children have to deal with the possibility their father may have killed their mother. Factions form and the kids have to reexamine their parents' marriage and what they know about their family history.One of the things that I loved about this book was that the author kept giving us the vantage point of other peripheral people like the Uber driver or the waitress. Those side characters may only interact with one of the main characters, but it makes us feel like we're an outsider looking in on this family. I thought it was a cool device. I also loved the way the author depicted Joy and her empty-nest-dom. This is the time of year when so many parents are dropping their kids at college and saying goodbye. It doesn't matter if they're gone forever or gone for the year. The author nailed that sense of longing, sadness, and emptiness parents face.

138,4.0,Moriarty has redeemed herself with this one. I was a little concerned after nine perfect strangers. I love these characters and how they were developed in this twisted story of family.
139,2.0,"Good god, what a slog! A family drama centered around a defunct tennis academy - the matriarch has disappeared and so commences the hunt for her whereabouts. This timeline intermingles with flashes to the previous year’s visit from a quirky house guest. Slow burns are fine. Family dramas are fine. Just please make the story interesting. I *did* like the ending, but it took way too long to get there. "
140,4.0,"The four Delaney children are beginning to worry. Their mother sent them a text a week ago saying she was taking some time but she left her phone at home, and nobody has seen her since. They can’t find Savannah who had weirdly moved in with their parents after showing up on their doorstep, and their dad has scratches on his face. Now they must try to find out what happened to their mom. This felt like the Liane Moriarty we know and love! It reminded me of The Husbands Secret and Big Little Lies, both of which I loved! I really enjoyed the family drama and the different sibling characteristics and rivalries. It was super weird that they just let Savannah move in but it added so much to the story. I also really loved that while the base of the story their missing mother, the book felt like it was mores about the family dynamics. I don’t think Covid needed to be included in this one, it felt a bit out of left field and not necessary, but I can understand the desire to throw it in. If you love Moriarty, you will enjoy this book!"
141,4.0,"My favorite chapters of this book are where the POV is some random background person (waitress, salon worker) who is basically eavesdropping on the characters (usually one or more of the Delaney children) as they work out what has happened to their mom. It's a little weird (and kind of funny) to discuss out loud in public the fact that your dad may have murdered your mom. When the family is together in a group the story is the most compelling.I do not watch or really understand tennis, so a lot of those metaphors sailed right over my head. (Like a Serena Williams serve?) This entire family is shaped by tennis, the parents and the children spent much of their lives devoted to it, to the detriment of the family at times.Finding out what happened to Joy kept me reading, but I enjoyed getting to know the characters too. Except Savannah. I'm still not sure which version of her (any?) was the real one, and I found none of them likable. I kind of wish the Savannah parts hadn't been in the book, it still would have been good even without all her drama."
142,5.0,"This novel is classic Moriarty at her best. It's a messy family story told from multiple points of view and with multiple timelines that come together beautifully in a well crafted narrative. I know that it's become a staple for Moriarty, and maybe a little formulaic, but I love novels that are crafted like this - juggling timelines, storylines, secrets, and points of view. I always want to know more about what kind of planning goes into constructing stories like this. Moriarty does it really well, unfolding information about the characters in small snippets until you've got the whole story. Thanks to Libro.fm for the ALC and to Henry Holt for the print ARC."
143,4.0,Moriarty is just so readable. Ordinary lives made significant. 
144,4.0,"“We're all on our own. Even when you're surrounded by people, or sharing a bed with a loving lover, you're alone.”The Delaney appear to be the perfect family from the out side but from the inside the cracks have begun to slowly creep out. Joy and Stan were former tennis coaches who have no sold the business and are trying to learn how to relax. The 4 kids have their own lives and Joy wants nothing more than to be a Grandparent.Not one of the kid every quite achieving their full potential, no one game enough to say that aloud. Joy suddenly disappears and her children begin to dissect their parents marriage along with their finding history. Does Joy’s disappearance relate to the house guest Joy and Stan took in last year or is the picture perfect family hiding something?This book has Moriarty’s signature style of domestic drama. This would be a perfect Aussie tv series. I loved each of the characters and how relatable theirs life’s were. Laine’s 9th novel was perfection."
145,2.0,"This book was a bloated waste of my time. So why did I read it? Well I bought the book in a special deal and then read it to satisfy a prompt on an autumn read-along. It centers on a ""tennis family"". The parents ran a tennis academy and are now retired. They are bored out of their minds. I am dumbfounded when people retire and find nothing to occupy their time. Their four grown children are all struggling in various ways. A stranger, a young woman, shows up at the Delany's (the parents) house late at night and they take her in. She stays and stays. Then she leaves and a few weeks later, the mother disappears.I thought this was a thriller, and murder is a possibility throughout. But for 300 pages  nothing  happens. We learn about each of the couple's children's lives in mind numbing detail. And of course a lot about tennis which did not interest me at all. Then in the last one-third, there are developments.At 437 pages, this book is twice as long as it should be. It occurred to me that the author wrote it with a TV mini-series in mind. The end is a dud, with a ridiculous twist. Don't waste your time."
146,2.0,"This might be the most boring book I've read this year; which came as a surprise, because I've only read one of Liane Moriarty's previous books but that one was Big Little Lies and I was blown away by how much I loved that book and immediately got sucked into the story and characters. This book, however, is at least 150 pages too long and is incredibly boring as s result. I do think that Moriarty is very adapt at writing about small family dramas and the pettiness that can exist between siblings or different family members. It's something that's inherent to human nature, and she has a keen way of exploring that.Nevertheless, I didn't care about any member of the Delaney family, I thought they were all being spectacularly stupid (and I have when smart people make obviously dumb decisions for plot reasons) and the ending was just bizarre. I'm not even going to touch on the COVID-19 chapter at the end there, because really, what was that even? I'll check out some of her older books at some point because she's so beloved, but I'm definitely not in any hurry after this."
147,3.0,"I do love me a good chunky book. They really are the ones I've been buying in volume over the past 2 years. Alas, not every book needs a ridiculously high page count to tell its story. Apples Never Fall falls hard into this category. It truly did not need to be an almost 500-page novel. While I liked the structure of it, I liked the story of the Delaney family, their parent's marriage, their flaws, their secrets, I did not need so many pages to read about them. I also felt the reveal about the whereabouts of the missing mother ended with a meh. Good, not great and editors need to return with their slash of the pen, no matter who the author may be."
148,4.0,"(3.75 stars) I’m a fan of Liane Moriarty. Big Little Lies is one of my all time favorite books and I’ve enjoyed other books by her. So I was thrilled to see she had a new book out and that it was getting good reviews. Fast forward to me finishing the new book and being slightly disappointed. I loved how Moriarty weaved the story around tennis and an athletic family of 6. What was disappointing was that I never connected with any of the characters. Even the “villain” failed to rouse my emotions. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad book. It’s well-written and entertaining. I was just hoping for some of the same magic that I felt with Big Little Lies. There were glimpses of it but not enough."
149,4.0,"I usually take a few notes as I read to include in my final thoughts of a book. Not this time. This well-crafted work of juicy domestic fiction was so unputdownable that I didn't take a single note. I listened to the audiobook version (all 18 hours of it) and was completely captivated. The smart, fun writing and the absolutely impeccable narration kept me hooked from start to finish. Moriarty throws so much into this novel (tennis, missing persons, marriage and parenting, trading, physiotherapy), but the underlying theme is emotion - how we make others feel and how we respond to our feelings. I *highly* recommend ""Apples Never Fall""."
150,4.0,I received an advanced reader’s copy from Goodreads. Loved this book. Couldn’t put it down! It kept you wondering what was going to happen. Comes out is September. Get it!
151,5.0,"★★ 4.5 stars! ★★A finely layered, intriguing family drama and suspense! The narrator is amazing and the hours absolutely flew by. [full review to come]"
152,2.0,I feel like this book could have been 400 pages shorter. 🤷🏼‍♀️
153,3.0,"This story of a missing sixty-something woman set in contemporary Sydney has some of the hallmarks of Moriarty's earlier work. The book starts with the disappearance of Joy Delaney on Valentine's Day 2020. Then the story looks into to the past, starting with the day about 6 months earlier that Joy and her husband answer their door to a young woman, clearly hurt and in distress. The present and past are revealed by introducing us to the four grown Delaney children and their father. We learn about their youth, their family dynamics, their relationships, their ambitions, and about the Delaneys' connection to tennis.While the mystery of Joy's disappearance (a murder? a kidnapping? a running away?) and who may have been responsible is at the core of the novel, this is really the story of a family. For me, this was only okay. I didn't really connect to any of the characters and never got caught up in finding out what happened to Joy.The audiobook was read by Caroline Lee, who has narrated several of Liane Moriarty's books. Her performance was very good in terms of characterizations and expressive delivery. Thanks to the publishers for digital, print, and audio review copies."
154,4.0,"I like Moriarty's writing, and this audiobook was lots of fun. The narrator, Caroline Lee, is so talented. She's narrated other books by Moriarty and I enjoyed her style. Overall, this book was a hit for me. The main reason why I took off one star is because of the end. It should have ended when the mystery was solved. (view spoiler)[ I didn't think adding anything about the pandemic was needed. It did not add anything to the story. I would have preferred to know that everyone was happy and done. It felt odd. It didn't quite fit with the rest of the story.  (hide spoiler)]"
155,4.0,"A truly absorbing piece of domestic fiction that examines family, marriage, and sibling relationships.Stan and Joy Delaney seem to have it all -- fifty years of wedded bliss, a successful tennis academy that they've recently sold, and 4 grown, reasonably adjusted children. Unfortunately, retirement isn't exactly proving to be as exciting as they'd hoped and tensions build as they each reflect on their shared history and their individual disappointments. After a disastrous encounter with a young woman, Savannah, who shows up on their doorstep one night, things come to a boil and the family is having some serious issues. When Joy later goes missing, Stan is the main suspect. The children seem to take sides and no one wants to believe that Stan could be responsible. As the days drag on, each of them takes a closer look at each other and their memories. No spoilers.I really enjoyed this one though it took awhile for the story to really get going. Told in alternating points of view with time jumps, each of the characters comes slowly into perfect focus and the reader is left feeling that they know these people quite well. The author is an excellent writer and is really able to give these characters the depth and range to elicit our sympathy and frustrations. Set in Australia, the story comes alive on the pages and the mystery of Joy's disappearance begs to be solved. Enjoy!Thank you to NetGalley and Henry Holt & Company for this e-book ARC to read, review, and recommend."
156,4.0,"This has a similar set-up to Big Little Lies while being a totally different novel, which I really enjoyed. You get the mystery at the beginning, and then you follow the main characters, and then it all comes together at the end. The mystery is strong throughout (did he or didn’t he?), and there are even detectives added in along with the family members.The Big Little Lies adaptation being filmed in California seems to make my brain forget that I love that Moriarty’s novels are set in Australia. This time we have a tennis family. The parents were coaches, including of a player that went pro, and the four kids were all coached and placed in competitions growing up. Now they’re all grown doing separate things with varying views of growing up in a tennis family.And their mother is missing. After their parents took in a stranger to live with them. And there are confusing things that make it sound like maybe their father was involved with their mother’s disappearance…I love that the mystery was very much a page-turner to find out what happened but the characters were equally interesting–including the exploration of how we’re pigeon-holed as children and how even if we’re different adults, those who knew us as kids hold on to that childhood behavior. This book reminded me that Moriarty has a great ability of sucking me into a story and writing these asides for all the characters that are always the interesting thing about a person without weighing the reader down with unnecessary details. If you’re looking for something absorbing with equal detail to characters and plot, grab this one.(TW domestic violence/ briefly mentions past date rape, not detailed/ eating disorder/ mentions past teen having suicidal thoughts with no details/ anxiety)--from Book Riot's Unusual Suspects newsletter: https://link.bookriot.com/view/56a820..."
157,3.0,"This book was WAY longer than it needed to be and was a slog to get through, but I did love the humorous writing and the twists and the ending "
158,4.0,"Click here to join the spoiler discussion: https://www.howdidthatbookend.com/app...I’ve been a fan of Liane’s for years. The first book I read of hers was What Alice Forgot, and I’ve absolutely devoured all of her other books since. I’d love to re-read some of them to write reviews, if I ever find the time.Apples Never Fall was no exception to Liane’s brilliant writing. She’s back with another tale of the most dysfunctional of families, and this whole story is such a well-concocted web of lies that I couldn’t tear myself away from. As with many of her books, the mystery isn’t the main focus so much as the brutally honest look at each of the characters and the dynamics of the Delaney family. There are so many secrets and grudges within this family, and it was a delight to peel back the layers to figure out what really happened to Joy Delaney. I loved how a portion of the story was told through conversations between the Delaney siblings overheard by strangers.Savannah’s character was fascinating. I won’t go into detail to avoid spoilers, but she shows up in the Delaneys’ lives and immediately gets way too close to their parents. I was so intrigued by her motives, and couldn’t wait to figure out what she had to do with Joy’s disappearance.Thank you to Henry Holt for a gifted copy of this book and to LibroFM for the ALC. I received the ALC before the physical copy of this one, so I actually listened to most of it. I re-read a few passages when I received the physical copy, too.QOTD: Do you play tennis? I only have a couple times, and I’m terrible at it."
159,2.0,"Thank you NetGalley for an eARC in exchange for my honest review.I know my opinion of this book is the outlier, and I feel bad for saying negative things while there are so many wonderful reviews of this book. This book was...fine. It's about a bored retired couple, in boring suburbia, who have four adult children who all seem bored with their lives and each other. All six have links to the professional tennis world and you are constantly reminded of how competitive the Delaney family is (So! Competitive!), but I didn't get that at all. The stories from the kids' childhoods seemed like normal sibling stuff.Savannah showing up was weird, but rather than being interested in whatever the hell she was up to, I was too busy being annoyed by Joy's naivety and general aloofness. How could someone who ran a household, raised four kids, and managed an elite tennis academy be so irritatingly dumb? I did enjoy the reveal of Savannah's identity. Definitely the high point of the book.But then Joy wasn't murdered and it was back to being boring. I was really hoping she was murdered so something would happen.How could she have written such a detailed letter to Stan and then send an incoherent, autocorrected disaster of a text to her kids? She would have checked that, or sent a correction.Anyway, this is a quick, easy book that doesn't require much brain power of the reader."
160,4.0,"Another great family dynamics book from this well known Australian author. The Delaney family look like a normal family from the outside with parents Joy and Stan and four grown up children, living their own lives. Joy and Stan have recently retired from their successful tennis coaching business after 50 years and now have to find how to fill in their time. But looks can be deceiving, undercurrents run deep and with small flash backs we learn that our childhood can really shape the adult and not all was rosy in Joy and Stan’s marriage. It all comes to a head when a young woman named Savannah knocks on the Delaney parents door one night, claiming to be a victim of domestic violence and somehow she is embraced into the house, especially by Joy. And then a few months later after Savannah has left, Joy disappears and Stan finds himself under scrutiny.At times I really wasn’t sure I even liked Joy or Stan but their children did stir empathy from me as I felt they were a product of their parents lifestyle/job.(ie obsession with tennis). This book really focuses more as a family drama than a mystery of Joy’s disappearance and that was fine with me. While I did enjoy this novel it wasn’t my favourite of this authors but still highly recommended.Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for a copy to read."
161,5.0,a really great read- unputdownable!
162,4.0,"Apples Never Fall by Liane Moriarty was as fun as making this reel with my nephew was.This was a moving story of Stan and Joy’s family of six. They both ran a tennis school, and both coached at their school. The story has a dual timeline going back and forth to the past when Joy went missing and the present when they are investigating her case.It was a character-driven story about Delaney’s family. The author did a great job penning vivid detail about this family to the point that it made me feel like they were my own.Overall, I enjoyed this book however, I’d liked it more if it was a bit shorter with fewer dialogues. "
163,4.0,"#FirstLine - The bike lay on the side of the road beneath a gray oak, the handlebars at an odd, jutted angle, as if it had been thrown with angry force.Today book was filled with so many twisted and turns. I thought I had it figured out, but I certainly did not! It was so original with characters you have strong feelings about. You will love some and others; well…not so much. You will be pulled into the life of this family and follow along as they try to figure out what happened! An amazing story. I recommend it highly!!! "
164,5.0,"Wow, what a fabulous book by one of my favorite authors. The best book I’ve read this year. Her characters leap off the page, her story lines are woven so beautifully. I had to stop reading so many times and just absorb this book. I found myself re-reading passages like I was reading a poetry book. I know that sounds crazy but it was magical. Bravo Liane Moriarty, I can’t wait for your next book! ❤️"

169,4.0,"Not my favorite of hers, but Moriarty hasn't really disappointed me yet. It started a bit slow. A lot of beating a dead horse with important characterizations of everyone. The story was really good though. I enjoy the signature style of jumping back and forth in time until we meet in the middle (or the end). I never really doubted (view spoiler)[Joy was alive. I figured she got caught up in some Savannah-related thing, (hide spoiler)] but it was still a good journey to get to the ending.But the ending... (view spoiler)[Moriarty decides to add the COVID pandemic and how it affects her characters in at the end of the book, having it hit just after Joy is ""found."" I am not sure I liked this. It didn't make it any more ""real"" to me. It felt forced. It didn't add to the story at all.  (hide spoiler)]Spoilery synopsis for my garbage memory:(view spoiler)[Stan and Joy Delaney's lives are Tennis. They play(ed) doubles and were the best around. They owned a tennis school. Stan was the coach to this kid, Harry Haddad who ended up being famous for tennis, but he leaves him and goes to another coach before hitting it really big and the Delaney's are all mad about this. Come to find out near the end, that Joy actually talked Harry's dad into doing this because she wanted Stan to coach and focus on their 4 kids who all played tennis.They have this weird girl stay with them for a while. She shows up with the purpose of punishing them for being jerks to her when she was a kid. She was starving because her horrible mother starved her for ballet and they were all mean. She is Harry's sister, living with their awful mom while Harry gets to live with their ""great"" dad. Turns out Harry's dad tells Harry she has cancer so he has to win and make money to help pay for treatment (a lie). What great people. Anyway, she starts to really like the Delaney's and the reason Joy is ""missing"" is she goes on an Off-Grid thing hosted by Harry Haddad with Savannah.There are some really silly coincidences that cause all the confusion which was like... okay... I mean what are the odds? But meh, I enjoyed the characters.Their kids.Logan, in a relationship with Indira. Recently broken up. Going to get back together and he's going to be a tennis coach again.Brooke, recently divorced from spirit-crushing husband. Owns a PT business.Amy, has issues, starts dating her roommate Simon. It's sweetTroy, very rich, lets his ex wife unfreeze their embryos so she can have a baby. (hide spoiler)]"
170,3.0,"Delving into the cracks of a seemly perfect family, Moriarty's new novel is strongly character driven and exposes the secrets, deceit and betrayals of the Delaney family after their Mother goes missing. Questions are asked, accusations thrown out as the Delaney children begin to query whether their Father could have something to do with her disappearance. Things become messy, after all what do you do if your Father has hurt your Mother? Character development is a huge part of what makes this novel work. As a reader you learn so much about the Delaney's and of their dysfunctional family unit: the unmet expectations, the jealousy and the failed dreams. There is so much tension, it's easy to see why they'd second guess their Father - I was certainly pointing fingers at everybody! The one character we learn the least about is Savannah, the girl who arrives seemly out of the blue. It's when she enters the picture, that things become real interesting! None of the characters were particularly likeable, however I still found myself fascinated by the mystery at the heart of the plot. I needed to find out more about Savannah, how she was connected and what had happened to Joy. The writing is twisty, so full on and completely suspicious that although at times the story became a bit slower in pace, there was no way I was putting it down! And the ending!? It was not at all what I was expecting. At first, I was a little disappointed when it came to the big reveal BUT with a few chapters left, little did I know Moriarty had a trick up her sleeve... and it was that little bit of wicked I was waiting for - what an intense read! 🍎🍏"
171,4.0,"4/5 starsThis follows the Delaney family- soulmates and forever tennis partners Joy and Stan and their four children. The story starts off with the children (now adults) discussing that their mother might be missing. But, they're hesitant to report it to the police because they don't want everyone to think their dad is responsible. As the story unfolds and more days pass without hearing from Joy, they start to wonder maybe their dad knows something?Not sure why is is in the mystery thriller category for the choice awards? It's more of a lit fic/dysfunctional family/character study type of story. Think Malibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid. We spend so much time with each member of the family getting to know them, all their flaws, secrets, and little quirks. They all had so much depth as characters with realistic traits and motivations. Although I grew fond of each family member, Joy was my favorite Delaney by far. Absolutely adore her. The reason this wasn't quite a 5 star for me was because I do agree with all the people saying it was a little bit lengthy. After the point of the story where Joy's disappearance is solved there was quite a bit left and I felt like much if it wasn't necessary. Especially where COVID was randomly introduced at the end. I really enjoyed my first Liane Moriarity experience. The writing style was easy to get into and the characters were compelling. Definitely looking forward to reading more from her. Also slight TW for eating disordered behavior. It came up a few times and caught me off guard because I hadn't seen anyone mention it."
172,3.0,"2.5 starsMy friend got this for me and we read it together. I can say that this book… was weird. I expected a shocking mystery that unravelled the Delaney’s unbelievable secrets. I expected a page turner. It was an such underwhelming experience (and a headache).- I didn’t realise how much this book would dwell on tennis. It wasn’t even on the blurb. It got boring and repetitive.- The secrets that were revealed… weren’t really worth a mystery? Idk. It wasn’t convincing. (Was it really a mystery though?)- There were a lot of unnecessary chapters and characters. Many things didn’t add to the story and just made it really slow. It was too long for no apparent reason. (Brooke’s migraines, Amy’s therapy sessions, side characters that didn’t play an important role to the story, etc.)I was intrigued at first. My expectations were really high. It was executed so poorly — a really REALLY slow burn with no twist. I pushed hard through all those pages for nothing like why 😭 why such an anticlimactic reveal??? What was the reason?? I genuinely wanna know Liane Moriarty’s thought processThe ending dragged A LOT too, there was no point in a lot of it and I found it unnecessary. However, I must say that I enjoyed the last CHAPTER. Chapter 71 and nothing before that. It was dark. If only the entire book had that tone. I would read another book by her if it was only about Savannah."
173,5.0,"I love watching tennis and sport in general. I was never active professional but I was interested in my favorite athletes life and I consider me a sport entusiast. When I saw this huge book I was quite scared and when I had the possibility to listen I was in seven heaven. It is about a family that live for tennis. They were all in the circus but now they are doing other things. Mother and father are retired and the children found other things to do. But tennis is always there. It was nice learning about them in the past, and it was also sad what happened to them, they were not excactly happy. They were separated and no children. And the mother wanted so much grand child. And this mother one day is missing. Also an other woman that was somehow connected to the family os nowhere around. But slowly slowly we get to know all the background and all the feelings. And also the mystery of disapearing is resolved. And apples never fall. Not all decision we make in life are good for us, or for someone else. But we always try to do the best. Sometimes we can repair something but sometimes we can not."
174,5.0,"Moriarty writes about a group of people, many of whom are first order relatives of one another, but also significant others, coworkers, friends, enemies, school mates, club members, wait staff... lots of people of all ages sometimes thinking to themselves but largely in conversation with one another. And the amazing thing is even though I don't know anyone who resembles their characteristics, the whole way through the book in the back of my head I'm going ""yup, just like that; oh, yeah; nailed it.""It's a weird phenomena to be reading a work of fiction, knowing full and damn well it's a work of fiction, set in a place so far from me that just flying there would take 22 hours, and all the way through I'm congratulating her on writing about these people so accurately. Weird effect, but cool. Yes, please, tell me about staring in the fridge and wondering ""what can I fix for dinner?"" and how boring that is and also about everything else you can think of. Even the acknowledgements are entertaining, which doesn't seem possible.Library copy"
175,5.0,"Liane Moriarty specialises in big family dramas that are a little bit darker than they first appear and always have a strong mystery at the core. I've read and loved both Big Little Lies and Nine Perfect Strangers, but I think Apples Never Fall is my favourite so far.The story is set in Australia and centres around the Delaney family. Thirty years ago, Joy and Stan were moderately successful tennis players but when their children were born they gave up the circuit and switched to running a training academy. While each of their children inherited their talent, none of them were good enough to take it further. The very competitive Troy is now a wealthy trader. Logan, who makes a point not to compete at anything any more, teaches business studies. The youngest, Brooke, forever playing catch-up, has recently opened her own physiotherapy practice. Only Amy remains a free spirit/problem child - depending which parent you ask!This is one of those stories where if the characters had just sat down and talked through their problems with a family therapist, this would have been a very short, dull book! And if Joy had not vanished without trace at the start of the book, with husband Stan soon touted as the main suspect, all the Delany's simmering and festering tensions would never have rocketed to the surface. As the police begin their investigation, each character is forced to re-examine their past, and how their family relationships - and tennis! - has contributed to how they've shaped their lives. Apples Never Fall is an incredibly clever, twisty family drama with brilliantly drawn characters that feel very true-to-life. Liane's skill is such that whichever viewpoint I was reading, that person became my favourite character - until the next scene! If the epilogue seems longer than one would expect, keep reading for a jaw-dropping finish! I thoroughly enjoyed it. Apparently there is a TV series on the way. I can't wait!Apples Never Fall will be published in the UK on 14th September 2021.Thank you to Liane Moriarty and Michael Joseph (Penguin) for my copy of this book, which I received via NetGalley and reviewed voluntarily."
176,5.0,"Apples Never Fall reminds me a lot of Anxious People in its style, and of Where'd You Go Bernadette with all the flashbacks and the missing person and having to piece it all together.Liane Moriarty has a strong skill in characterization and creating authenticity in her characters and their relationships with each other. She also has a good way of weaving stories that compel readers to keep reading.I was lucky enough to be able to get the audiobook for this from my library soon after it was released, which meant I didn't have the time to leisurely listen. I found myself binging on this book as I really became involved and wanted to understand what had happened to Joy (the missing woman) and what was really going on (because obviously all is not as it seems to be).This would be a good book to discuss at book clubs. There are several instances of swearing, but not excessive, and limited to certain characters (I felt these instances gave these characters their signature voice and showed frustration with what they were facing)."
177,4.0,"This novel was almost too sprawling to describe. On the surface, it’s the depiction of a long-time marriage, but it ends up being a character study of seven (!) people, and a murder mystery as well. The main story centers on the disappearance of 68 yo Joy, the unflaggingly domestic doormat / martyr / mother of four and wife of one demanding, hostile, cranky old man. Did Joy leave or did Stan murder her? Did Savannah, the mysterious guest, have something to do with it? How will the grown children respond to this new and overwhelming pressure on their already messy, flailing lives?Moriarty is a fantastic writer, even more so in the first half of this overlong book, when I had the energy to appreciate her subtle hints and foreshadowing. She is brilliant at presenting a character who seems frustratingly inept at life, but as we see flashbacks, their behavior becomes understandable and reasonable. And then they morph by the end of the book, although the end of this novel was both rushed and too long. So much of what I didn’t understand about the characters was explained in a fulsome burst in the last few chapters. It was interesting, especially the chapter on Savannah! But I could have used more of that info earlier, when I was about to give up on these frustrating people. And the ending was a bit of a disappointment.After I finished the book, my first question was, “What was that all about? What was her point?” Beyond the facile, “people can evolve if you put them under enough pressure,” there were themes of grace and forgiveness, adaptability, what you do to survive! But what I enjoyed the most was what Moriarty said about old people...some of them are still fierce, brazen warriors, even if all you see is the foolish, accommodating surface personality. A thought-provoking novel that could keep a book club discussion going for days."
178,3.0,"I started this and with more interesting reads in hand, put it down, but then picked it up again with that digital library expiration looming near. In the beginning of the story I was curious, did the apples on the side of the road mean tragedy for our leading lady? Did she meet with foul play? Did Savannah do something sinister? Was it the husband? Maybe she just left cause the family drama was real.But as the story trudged forward like a snail making its way through molasses I stopped caring. The ending was unexpected, but also unexciting. I felt like I came all this way for nothing. In the end what happened to our leading lady? *spoiler* Nothing. She neither abandoned the family or met with foul play, nor was she struck by a car whilst riding her bike. She just came back. She didn't leave in a huff, perhaps the biggest villain in all of this were the pets that buried laundry or ate well meaning notes. This is my second book by the author and like in Nine Perfect Strangers it seemed like a lot of build up for a relatively mundane reveal. I didn't hate it, but I barely liked it. I'm going to try some of Moriarty's more well known works before I bother with a new release in the future."
179,2.0,"Bo-ring. This book was long, and when I had to put it down, I didn't want to pick it up again. Another silly, ridiculous ending (as with 9 Perfect Strangers). The very last twist sort of was okay, but it doesn't fix the book. THAT part should have been extended and the others shortened (or cut out). None of these characters are likeable. I'm not sure if I'm just over this domestic type of ""thriller"" fiction, but it's wearing on me. Also, the same narrative over and over about women's role in the home - while all true, I'm sick of reading about it. It's not that it isn't true or interesting, but it's the WAY it's written - it makes these women sound crazy, not relatable. Don't think I'll be putting my name on the next wait list ... "
180,5.0,"Michael Connelly returns us to Los Angeles and a divided United States undergoing the trauma of the pandemic and the background of a socially and politically turbulent environment, including the Black Lives Matter protests, calls to defund the police, and the horrors of the insurrection. We get a picture of a LAPD that feels underappreciated and a public that views them with suspicion, officers are doing only what is absolutely necessary, being reactive rather that proactive, and not looking favourably on those police officers that are genuinely committed to solving crime. Detective Renee Ballard is still doing nights on the late shift, although she is now actually living in a apartment, and having lost her beloved dog, Lola, to bone cancer 8 months ago, she is looking for another dog for companionship, and settles on a rescue dog that is the polar opposite of Lola, Pinto.New Year's Eve celebrations result in a gun shooting that Ballard becomes aware is murder when she examines the victim, Javier Raffa, once a gang member of Las Palmos, but now a business and family man with children. A lucky break means that the bullet casing is recovered from beneath a car, and it turns out this gun was used in another shooting years ago, the victim was Albert Lee. Coincidentally, the now retired Detective Harry Bosch worked the case. Strangely, the murder book on the cold case is missing, and Ballard assumes Bosch has it. However, this turns out to not to be true as once again the two detectives find themselves working together. Ballard is on another case, the Midnight Men, a tag team of rapists, and there is now another victim, but there are new aspects to the investigation but Detective Lisa Moore, also on the case, is seriously lacking any desire to work the case.Ballard finds herself being let down everywhere, by fellow police officers, the department and others, the only person she can rely on, who remains steadfast and has her back is Harry. Unsurprisingly, she begins to harbour doubts about her future with the LAPD, but this is to have serious repercussions, as her determination to find the truth and seek justice leaves her isolated and in danger. Connelly, as a seasoned crime writer, once again demonstrates why he remains a popular author, providing his trademark details of policing and running investigations, along with a background of American contemporary realities. This is an entertaining and engaging addition to this wonderful crime series, well plotted, full of suspense and tension, whilst covering issues that resonate such as violence against women. Highly recommended. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC."
181,3.0,"This latest mystery, focuses more on LAPD Detective Renee Ballard as she tries to solve two different cases, one an apparent random shooting on New Year's Eve in which a now business and family man with children but formerly a gang member of Las Palmos gets murdered and the other involving a pair of brutal rapists, the Midnight Men.The first case links to an unsolved ten year old murder initially investigated by her friend, now retired Harry Bosch. Ballard doubts her future with the LAPD, gets let down by fellow police officers as her determination and fearlessness to fight the LAPD bureaucracy as well as take on violent criminals remains steadfastThe style of writing is fine but not gripping. I just wanted to enjoy a book but this book goes on and on about the covid, mask, vaccine agenda. The realities we are trying to escape in a good bookOver all, I enjoyed this story, the plot and the characters were compelling but it's inclined to being too political which I found irritatingI would recommend for fans of police procedural and politically motivated people I would like to end my review with a recommendation of a wonderful thriller by a young author. Though not a police procedural but a fast-paced organized crime thriller, Money Ain't Loyal"
182,5.0,"On the Clock.Detective Renee Ballard is back on the ‘Late Show’. Just as she likes it. A supposed punishment, she’s secretly pleased to be working the midnight to eight AM shift again. More freedom of movement and fewer people to report to.Although this time she’s saddled with a partner who’s lazy and unmotivated. What’s a girl to do?Well, Renee works the cases herself until her overflowing plate prompts her to contact retired cop Harry Bocsh when a potential murder investigation intersects a previous unsolved case of his. Then, it’s off to the races.I’ve read most, if not all, of the twenty two Harry Bosch books and the three previous Renee Ballard stories. As police procedurals, I love the balance between complicated plots, explanations, with just enough detail. The Dark Hours is no exception and I didn't want this to end. Weighing heavier on the Ballard side, Renee battles time limitations while navigating public hatred, co-worker apathy, and department politics. She’s putting in the hours, but she seems to be one of the few wanting to actually do her job.It’s a lot to deal with, but my bet’s on the dark horse. Thank you to Little Brown & Company, Michael Connelly, and Novel Suspects for my print copy to read in advance of the November 9 2021 publication date.."
183,5.0,"Review to be posted to blog: books-are-a-girls-best-friend.comNowadays, times appear rougher than they used to be. Danger shows itself in different ways. Here and now, you can’t always see what’s right in front of your face simply because everyone is hiding behind a mask and Covid is ever-present. Never one to shy away from reality, Michael Connelly’s new novel, The Dark Hours brings it home. It’s in The Dark Hours that Detective Renee Ballard does her best work. She is a night owl and she loves flying solo. When a homicide occurs on her watch in the Late Shift, she wants it, even if the investigation should go to the detectives in the Hollywood Division. Once she dives into the case, what she finds, makes her want it even more. Her case links to an old unsolved crime, a cold case of retired Detective Harry Bosch’s, and wouldn’t you know it, the two decide to work together to solve them both. Ballard, of course, investigates other crimes as well, one of which involves several women assaulted in their homes, in the middle of the night, by a group called The Midnight Men, which brings about a different type of danger altogether.This was a nail-biter, to say the least!A very well-written, well-done police procedural, which took place during the pandemic. Something very few authors even attempt. I truly appreciated the care that Michael Connelly took, to center a police procedural in and around the pandemic and give major kudos to him for that.  What I love most about this series is the camaraderie between Ballard and Bosch which warms my heart. If you know me, you know how much I love these characters, Harry Bosch specifically. I could, in fact, wax poetic about my love for Harry Bosch (and have, in many a book review in this series, lol). While I wish that Bosch took a more prominent role here, I still adored this novel and love the character of Renee Ballard. It's clear that there will be some changes in store for both of these characters and I look forward to seeing where life takes them. A huge thank you to Little Brown and Company and NetGalley for the arc. Thank you for always being so generous in feeding my Harry Bosch obsession (lol). Published on Goodreads, Instagram, and Twitter. "
184,5.0,"This is the first mystery I’ve read that tackles COVID, Black Lives Matter, Defund the Police protests and the January 2021 Insurrection head on. I really appreciated that Connelly didn’t try to avoid the current times, like I see so many series doing. It’s NYE going into 2021 and the vaccine is around the corner. Renee Ballard has already had COVID. A majority of the police force is demoralized, working the bare minimum, because why bother? She’s been partnered with Lisa Moore, of the Hollywood sex crimes unit to try and track down two tag-team serial rapists. But she also catches another case, a homicide that occurs at a NYE party. A homicide that has links to a murder Harry Bosch investigated years ago, before he retired. Of course, her LT wants her to turn over the murder to the Homicide dept. But she keeps delaying, while she and Harry begin an off the books investigation. Connelly perfectly captures the mood of the police. It seems like Ballard is the only one that even cares anymore. As the story goes on, she walks a fine line between catching the criminals and the ire of the department. I really enjoyed Ballard in the first three books, but she truly won my heart by adopting a rescue dog. This is truly Ballard’s story, not Harry’s. There’s a cliffhanger at the end and I’ll be curious to see how the next in the series starts off. Once again, Connelly has put together a fabulous story. It moves quickly with a great sense of underlying suspense. I did see how the rape story was going to play out, but that didn’t dampen my enjoyment. I can only hope some studio is smart enough to tag this series for a tv mini-series. My thanks to Netgalley and Little, Brown for an advance copy of this book."
185,5.0,"LAPD Detective Renee Ballard loved working the dark hours, her graveyard shift and on New Year’s Eve she and her partner were parked under a bridge among the homeless people, waiting for the traditional ‘rain of lead’ as guns went off into the night air to celebrate the arrival of a new year. But not long into the New Year, Ballard received a call of a body found at a street party – when the bullets go up, they must come down – so did the ex-gangster die from one of those random bullets, or was he murdered? Meanwhile a team of two rapists had been brutally attacking women across the city and Ballard was determined to stop them. With her teamed up with ex-LAPD Detective – now retired – Harry Bosch, because of the ex-gangster case, she picked his brain and used his considerable experience to work on the two cases. She was being ostracized by her department, even down to her superior, and although she liked working alone, in some situations it was preferable to have a partner. It was when she’d gone home to sleep after working almost twenty-four hours straight, that danger came closer and Ballard knew she must be near to having the answers she needed... The Dark Hours is the 4th in the Renee Ballard series by Michael Connelly and once again it was an outstanding read! With plenty of action, lots of twists, the pandemic creating change in every situation, and Ballard crossing the line to get the job done, I thoroughly enjoyed every part of Mr Connelly’s latest title. I love Renee’s feisty, gutsy passion to get the bad guy at almost any cost, and her interaction with Bosch is proving to be an excellent partnership. The Dark Hours is another great police procedural from the pen of a master, which I recommend highly.With thanks to Allen & Unwin for my ARC to read in exchange for an honest review."
186,5.0,"As one of my favourite authors, a new Michael Connelly book is like Christmas come early for me. His books were some of the first police procedural books that I ever read, thanks to my dad who thought I would like them. And he was right. All these years later and Harry Bosch is my all time favourite fictional detective. There was a happy dance happening when I opened this bookmail in the middle of lockdown in Sydney 2021. A very big thank you to Allen and Unwin, who understand my obsession with all things Michael Connelly.This is the 4th Renee Ballard book and I am liking her more and more each book. She is one tough cookie, working the Late Show (or graveyard shift) for the LAPD in Hollywood. She sees the more hidden and darker side of the city and that is the way that she likes it. This book starts on new years eve 2020 during the pandemic. It has been a tough year with lockdowns, department politics, Black Lives Matter and the scrutiny of the police force as a whole. On the job is now more dangerous than it has ever been. As always with a Connelly book, there is alot going on. Renee is called to the scene of a homicide early on new years day. She wants to hold on to the case and gives it everything she has. When she finds a link to an old case that her friend and mentor, Harry Bosch worked on, the pair team up once again to hunt down the killer. While she is doing this, she is also working on the Midnight Men case where women are being in attacked in her own home. A serious page turner, The Dark Hours shows the lesser seen side of the law. Renee is not one to stick to the rules and probably why she gets on with Harry so well. They are a team that will never give up and really care about the victims of the crimes. They question the system and it is not always taken well by the higher ups.It will come as no suprise to anybody that this was a 5 star read for me and will be one of my favourite books of 2021. Do yourself a favour and pick up a Connelly book, sooner rather than later.The Dark Hours is released November 9th."
187,5.0,"This is the 23rd book in the Harry Bosch series by author Michael Connelly but is the character Renee Ballard features just as prominently. Michael Connelly is probably my favourite author so I was eager to read this and not surprisingly read it in one sitting. All the usual ingredients are there, great characters, interesting plot and expertly written.LAPD Detective Renée Ballard and ex detective Harry Bosch team up to try and solve two cases where investigation appear to have hit a brick wall. In Hollywood on New Year’s Eve Ballard is called to a crime scene where an auto shop owner has been fatally hit by a bullet in the middle of a crowded street party.Ballard’s investigation leads her to look into another unsolved murder that was previously worked by Detective Harry Bosch. Together Ballard and Bosch try to solve the shooting and search for a two rapists who have been called ‘the Midnight Men’ and team up to terrorise the public committing awful crimes.400 pages went so quick as I raced through this novel, fast paced full of action and I loved every minute of it, I just wished there were another 400 pages."
188,4.0,"4+ Fostered by my mother, my love for mysteries and detective novels, began when I was a pre-teen. Long ago. Together we read Phyllis Whitney, Victoria Holt, Agatha Christie and watched on television, The Thin Man, my mom's favorite. Throughout the years I've read many series, dropped some as my reading tastes slightly changed, picked up a few. Connelly and his Bosch novels is a series I've faithfully read from the beginning.Now retired, or supposedly retired, he works on unsolved cases. The addition of a young Ballard, a detective who reaches out to Harry, is a welcome addition, as well as keeping the series fresh. What is unique about this book is that the author doesn't shy away from the events occuring at present. A demoralized police department, social unrest, Covid, masks and vaccines are integrated into the story. The plot itself features two different cases but Harry's help is once again sought as one of the cases touched on an unsolved that Harry had worked when he was in the department. These stories always read fast, always interesting and we'll written. Ballard is different because she doesn't shy away from using unusual and often frowned on tactics to solve a case. A little like a younger Bosch, though of course she is female. At books end Ballard will be given a choice. Alas, we have to wait for the next book to see what decision she makes.ARC from Netgalley."
189,4.0,"This story mostly revolves around LAPD Detective Renée Ballard. It is New Years Eve 2020 and Renée is back working the late show. Parked beneath an underpass as shelter waiting for midnight and revelers to fire guns into the air. Renée would much rather be working solo but she has no choice in the matter. She has been partnered with Lisa Moore of the Hollywood sex crimes unit. They have been investigating rape cases where the suspects are a pair of men dubbed the Midnight Men. It is New Year's Eve and all hands on deck. Moral is low following riots, Black Lives Matter protests, calls to defund the police. Members of the LAPD are doing the bare minimum. Reactive rather than proactive. This includes Moore.Then Ballard and Moore getted called to the scene of a shooting victim. The owner of an auto shop has been fatally hit by a bullet in the middle of a crowded street party. It doesn't take long to determine that the fatal shot was not from a bullet that fell from the sky. It was close up and intentional. A shell casing is retrieved and it matches a cold case that Detective Harry Bosch had worked. Ballard goes to Bosch's house to try and determine where the cases intersect. What did the victims have in common. Moral and motivation are low in LAPD but not with Ballard and Bosch.Together they are able to figure out what the victims had in common, the motivation for the shootings, and potential suspects. But Renée is supposed to be working on the Midnight Men case not a murder case. She is supposed to turn over her report on the shooting to someone else and focus on the Midnight Men. She wants to keep the murder case and works around the clock all the time partnered with someone who would rather be enjoying the holiday weekend and isn't even around. But Harry is always there. She knows that he has her back.Once again Renée runs afoul of her superiors but that doesn't stop her. Her career is in jeopardy but she is thinking about a change anyway. Maybe return to Hawaii. Maybe partner with Bosch. Work on unsolved murders? The ending was a cliff hanger. What does the future have in store for Renée Ballard? Looking forward to the next book in the series to find out.This story dealt with some very timely issues (at the time this review was written) ... COVID-19, vaccination and vaccine hesitancy, social unrest. Michael Connelly writes police procedurals and this story also talks about the topic of defunding the police and it's consequences. A great story with things to think about."
190,1.0,"I have numerous problems with this one. Michael Connelly has lost his way. I think his success with the Bosch TV show has gone straight to his liberal mind. He literally spent 35 or so Bosch books being completely unpolitical (I know cuz I read them ALL!) and has now gone completely high and to the left. Insanity. Not only do you get every reference to the pandemic (which I DO NOT WANT TO READ ABOUT WHEN EVERY SECOND OF EVERYDAY OF OUR LIVES REVOLVES AROUND THAT NONSENSE!!) But we also get every liberal talking point thrown in just for fun too. Put on ur mask, get ur vax, Black Lives Matter, on and on and on! This is my last Connelly book. What really infuriated me as a Bosch lover, picturing my father in law as a Vietnam veteran badass cop who spent his entire career at LAPD kicking ass, not letting the department dictate his work ethic and basically being a complete and total badass all around, Connelly wants us to believe Bosch would sit in his house cowering during this bogus pandemic?!? I’m sorry but any Vietnam vet would never sit back and let the government shoot him up with an experimental vax. Give me a break. Sorry, Harry, I know this wasn’t you. What a joke. Connelly, you are no longer a must buy for me. I hope that makes you happy since you caved to Hollywood liberals and sold yourself out. Bravo. "
191,4.0,"Renee Ballard, the strong female protagonist, is an LAPD detective. She is intensely devoted to her job, and finds the bureaucracy and lazy cops on the force frustrating. She wants to solve a murder, but after she does most of the work, the case is turned over to someone else. The case of the serial rapists is so important to her that she actually resigns to solve it. Harry Bosch is there to help when her fellow officers won’t. Thanks to Edelweiss and the publisher for allowing me to review an advance copy of this edge of your seat thriller."
192,4.0,"Thank you Allen and Unwin for sending me this book to review. It was absolutely fantastic. I loved it. Michael is highly recommended by many people I know , and there will be lots of discussions about this one.I really liked the character of Renee Ballard and connected with her the most. I loved the banter between all the departments. This book had me from start to finish. If you love books about police , you will love this book. The ending was superb.Highly recommend."
193,5.0,"It’s New Year’s Eve and LAPD Detective Renée Ballard is working “the late show” shift in Hollywood. After the normal tradition of people shooting bullets in the air, she is called to a crime scene where a local business owner is found dead in what was made to look like an accident from a falling bullet. Forensics reveals that the bullet was shot from the same gun as a bullet from a decade old cold case of the now retired Detective Harry Bosch. In addition, Ballard is part of an investigation into two rapists called The Midnight Men who have struck several times around the area. In working her cases, Ballard finds roadblocks at every turn including budget issues as well as some apathy and struggles within her department, a disapproving supervisor and a possible coverup. Seeking help, she works behind the scenes with Bosch, who has few fans left at the LAPD. The Dark Hours is the fourth book featuring Ballard, a very appealing character. She has added a great element to the world of Harry Bosch, who continues to be a talented investigator even though he is no longer on the force. They make a terrific team. The cases in this latest installment are as strong as ever. Author Michael Connelly keeps things timely with real-world events and social issues. Ballard has recovered from Covid and vaccinations for the general public are about to be rolled out. Masks are a part of life. It is all handled well. If you haven’t read any of the more than 30 books in what is known as the ""Bosch Universe,"" it’s time to jump onboard. Starting with the Renée Ballard series would be a good place to begin unless you’re adventurous and want to start from the very beginning. Try watching the Bosch television series on HBO – it is a perfect companion to the books. Many thanks to Little, Brown and Company | Hachette Book Group and Novel Suspects Insiders for the opportunity to enjoy The Dark Hours in advance of its November 9, 2021 publication. Rated 4.5 stars.Review posted on MicheleReader.com."
194,5.0,"Michael Connelly again delivers fantastic read, the third in the Ballard Bosch series, this one is centred on Renee Ballard with Harry Bosch called in for a supporting role. Ballard still working the dark hours(the night shift) as a punishment, it actually suits her, although she works the small hours with an unmotivated and often absent partner. When a murder happens on her shift and the murder squad are busy with another case she temporarily runs with it until she has to hand it over. When she links it to an unsolved legacy case she calls Harry Bosch in to help her. She is also working on an unusual double rapist case where two men are breaking into houses around midnight and raping women. This case is the meat of the book so to speak and quite sinister yet intriguing. Set during the pandemic with the back drop of the Black Lives Matter movement and general distrust of the police, Connelly delivers an utterly compelling and complex read. Many plates are being spun by the author but he keeps them all spinning perfectly in this multi story tale. Ballard, taking centre stage here, is a superb and stubborn character. A strong and driven woman, she is allowed to shine here as Bosch plays second fiddle to her. I was all in with this one from first page to last. The more I read the more I realized the title of the book had many many meanings. Dark, current, atmospheric and ultimately satisfying, Connelly shows no sign of dropping his standards of putting out some of the best police procedurals/thrillers out there today. Get your hands on a copy if you can. Thanks to the publisher for the ARC through Netgalley. "
195,5.0,The only thing wrong with a Connelly book is that they end. I could read pages and pages more. He has not dropped a step even this far into the Bosch Universe.
196,4.0,"I have to say I have read every book in the series and that Michael Connelly is the best fiction writer in the universe lol. This was another good addition to the series and always a bummer when done with one of his books. Last year he wrote two books so one can always hope for two in 2022 lol. The two main characters were good as always and the carried the story. I however did not get into the one case of the two that involved murder-was somewhat complex and for me it missed the mark a little bit for him. The rape case was a good moving case and was good . I am glad Harry was more involved in the second half of the book. The two characters make a good team. I think this writer could write about a telephone book and it would be great.The ending kind of had three parts to it, the first part I was not wild about but the two other parts were good. The ending in a way was open ended for him but we have a good sense where it is going to go-she is following his footsteps and history lol.I give it around a 4.2 and say give it a big spin."
197,4.0,"Harry Bosch is ageing (aren’t we all!) and has been retired from the LAPD for some time now. We’ve been through his temporary return to work on cold cases and also a period working for the San Fernando Police Department, but now he’s completed that stint too. So what to do with him? He’s too good a character to lose so why not team him up with a younger cop who has many of the behaviours and traits we’ve witnessed Harry display for years and then tag Harry along as a mentor and sometime helper? That might do the trick. And that’s what Connelly has done – and done it pretty well too, in my view.Renée Ballard was initially introduced as a new stand-alone character, a detective with an interesting past who’d been relegated to the night shift after raising a sexual harassment complaint against a supervisor. She’s strong willed and punchy – just like Bosch – but she’s just different enough to avoid notions of a new mini-Bosch creeping into my thoughts. Well okay, not quite. I enjoyed the first Ballard book  The Late Show and then in her second outing Harry appeared on the scene and he’s been there ever since as a friend, mentor and sometimes a coincidental holder of information on relevant past cases. The combination does work well, although at times the fit does seem a little forced to me. But in this latest book there's the suggestion that Bosch maybe handing over the mantle to his younger counterpart - this is clearly Ballard’s story, with the old star making what feels like just a cameo appearance. The plot concerns two cases: that of a couple of guys who are on a break-in and rape spree in the City of Angels and the murder of an ex-gang member who’d been shot just as the clock struck twelve on New Year’s Eve. I won’t go into the detail but you can take it as read that both cases are interesting and the combination works well to maintain both variety and pace. As always, Connelly seems to get all the detail right, the cop talk feels authentic and some interesting insights into how the LAPD works are dropped in for good measure. The author is brilliant at this, he never loses me in his linear telling of a story or causes me to doubt actions taken by either the chasers or the chased. He’s simply a brilliant story teller.This is the first book I’ve read in which the COVID-19 pandemic has featured in such a prominent way. It’s not that a big thing is made of it, it’s more that it effects routines and behaviours very visibly. There’s also mention of the violent insurrection in Washington lest you have any doubt that MC keeps the clock ticking real time in his books. I’m not going to say this is his very best work, I just feel that the Bosch/Ballard combo feels just a little too clunky for that. But I did enjoy spending time with both of them and I’d be very happy if they could be brought back together in a partnership that feels more natural. The good news is that there are hints here that something maybe afoot in this regard - we’ll see how that plays out in due course."
198,2.0,"The Dark Hours (A Renee Ballard and Harry Bosch Novel 4), Michael Connelly, author; Titus Welliver, Christine Likin, narratorsIn this fourth book in the Renee Ballard series, The plot is obvious from the beginning. From the get-go, it is obvious that there are two crimes being investigated. One is the murder of a former gang member gone straight, and the other is the rape of several women. There is a little mystery, as the reader knows that the crimes will be solved by the indomitable Renee Ballard, who is the protégé of Harry Bosch. Both are rogue cups. Arrogant and defiant, because she really wants to work homicides, as she once did, Renee is not viewed as a team player. Often acting on her own, defying the rules, she attracts even more negative attention. Since she does not trust the department to have her back, so she often calls on Harry, instead, to back her up and protect her. This conflict makes her think about leaving the force and joining Harry Bosch doing private investigation. Her thoughts trouble her because Harry’s daughter is in the police academy. Shouldn’t she be more supportive? At the end of the book, the reader is left to wonder whether or not she will remain a police officer or join forces with Harry Bosch. Both ideas are now attractive to her, but it is a difficult choice. Although the story is laden with hackneyed phrases and trite sounding conversations and often seems like a treatise on male toxicity vs. women’s rights and inequality, it is also eye opening in one respect. It seems that having to follow the watered down current regulations and policies of the police department actually inhibits the solving of crimes. The bureaucracy and power structure make it hard to do one’s job. Also, the “honor among thieves”, code of silence, that protects wrongdoing in the department, often punishes the victim and not the perpetrator. The progressive, pro Democrat messages are unwelcome interruptions in the novel. The final insulting, political straw for me, was when the January 6th so-called insurrection is raised, and the murder of a policeman is mentioned. It is a false message, which has already been discredited, since the only murder that day was of an unarmed woman, climbing through a window in the Capital. The Capital Police Officer whose identity was hidden, at first, was not charged. "
199,4.0,"Ballard is back on her loved late shift and working on a serial rapist case when she is called to a nearby crime scene. What appears to be an accident is soon recognized as murder and the events that follow lead her to partner up with the retired Bosch to search for the killer. Most importantly, Connelly does not sidestep issues. He incorporates Covid, Black Lives Matter, the disturbed social and economic conditions, and calls to defund the police. He walks a tightrope between the view that LAPD, feeling unappreciated by the public, are being forced into a reactive rather than a proactive stance, and the recognition that the problems in law enforcement run much deeper than many believe. Another Michael Connelly procedural that never lets up from beginning to end. A great read!"
200,5.0,"Whenever I read a book by Michael Connelly, I am reminded of what a good writer he is and how much I enjoy his work. This is no exception. I was totally engrossed in the story; didn’t want to put it down. I really liked how he tapped into the “spirit” of 2020 with Covid and all the issues surrounding police. And, Bosch is my favorite Connelly character; so glad he played a major role in the story. If you are not familiar with any of Connelly’s works, I highly recommend him to anyone who likes police procedurals and good writing. This is book 4 of the series; I can’t wait for the next one in the series. It does work as a standalone, although do yourself a favor and go back and read the other three."
201,5.0,"Got a review copy. Great book, another awesome installment in the new Ballard series. Bosch plays a role in the book as well but could have had a larger role. But none the less this is a great book, Ballard works a couple cases and you can see some of the influence that Bosch is having on her and her procedures."
202,4.0,"November 19, 2021 Update Added a new item under Trivia and Link where author Michael Connelly gives a video tour of The Dark Hours locations in Los Angeles.Into the DarkReview of the Little, Brown & Co. audiobook edition, released simultaneously with the Little, Brown & Co. hardcover (November 2021)You surprise me Harry, that's all. I didn't think you listened to anything recorded in this century. - Renée Ballard reacts to Harry Bosch playing Compared to What performed by John Legend and The Roots (2010) on his stereo.There are not many light moments in this latest Renée Ballard mystery, so the above nod to Harry Bosch's jazz listening habits provided some relief. Otherwise this was another strong entry in the series which provided an opportunity for the now-retired detective Bosch to provide backup to the hard-pressed Ballard. Ballard is dealing with a not-too-cooperative partner, and a demoralized police department in this latest story which is set in the first days of 2021 in a still masked pandemic world of Los Angeles.Too much of the pandemic, defund the police, insurrection background will date these books in the future, but the two crime cases still provide effective suspense and investigative paths for the duo. One current murder case again involves a past unsolved cold case, which is how Bosch is brought in. In the other, Ballard is seeking to stop what appears to be a team of home invaders / assaulters. It does stretch believability that Ballard involves the retired Bosch to the extent that she does, often skirting the bounds of legality. Regular readers will just be happy that the senior investigator still has a role to play in Connelly's fictional universe. The ending gives us a cliffhanger as to how Ballard's career will continue. Fortunately the new Bosch TV streaming series Bosch: Legacy (2022 - ?) will allow a younger version of Harry to continue for the foreseeable future. The narration by now series regulars Christine Lakin (voicing Ballard) and TV-Bosch's Titus Welliver (voicing Bosch) was excellent as always. They alternate chapters for the most part, with the Ballard role dominating the material. Towards the end there are some limited dialogue exchanges.Trivia and LinkAuthor Michael Connelly gives a guided video tour of The Dark Hours locations, including Harry Bosch's favourite restaurant Birds Cafe and the location of Bosch's house in the Hollywood Hills, which is actually an empty lot after the last house there burned down 35 years ago."
203,4.0,"Whilst Renee Ballard may perform many feats of bravery within these pages, the action is fraught with tension as she is driven by forces that do not always include backup from her fellow cops who resent her. Go for the ride, as it is one heck of a roller coaster. Thank God for Bosch and his assists, otherwise she may not have survived the many harrowing situations she finds herself in.This book includes the latest newsworthy situations throughout the Pandemic and the civil unrest throughout the country. Just the 4th Ballard book in the series and looking forward to seeing her join forces with Bosch in future.I can't describe the plot as it would spoil this great book for other readers."
204,5.0,"As an avid reader, it's been interesting to me that authors of many of the books I've read over the past couple of years that are set in the present somehow manage to totally avoid what's going on in the world - most notably, the COVID-19 pandemic. A couple have set the time frame slightly before or slightly after, while others simply avoid the issue and carry on with their stories as if it didn't exist. Now comes a story that hits it - and other political goings-on - square on the nose (or more accurately, on the mask that's covering the nose). If I appreciated nothing else in this book, I'll give kudos for that.That said, it gets my vote for many other reasons, including an intriguing and attention-holding plot and competent, well-developed characters. That I've come to love them over previous books helps, of course, but overall that doesn't matter much; even if there's an occasional clinker amid the series (to which no author is immune), the characters are strong enough to carry the plot and result in a positive rating. For sure, though, this one's no clinker.Detective Renee Ballard is assigned to the West Hollywood Police Department's Sexual Assault team; checking out a homeless area under an overpass is where this story begins - as do the references to the vagaries of vaccinations and masking (Renee actually contracted the virus, which knocked her out of action for three weeks; now, she's been vaccinated and is very careful about wearing a mask herself). Most recently, she's been on the trail of a ""tag team"" of rapists who have struck twice. Here, a man is shot - perhaps accidentally - and it turns out the bullet came from the gun that was used in one of retired Detective Harry Bosch's cases back in 2011 (interestingly, while Harry has some health issues, he says he's not been vaccinated ""yet,"" so Renee wears a mask when they interact in person).Although Harry's murder book seems to have inexplicably disappeared from the department, he saved enough information for them to hit the ground running with their investigation. And then, Renee gets a call saying that the ""Midnight Men"" rapists have struck again. Now she's got two cases to worry about, but as the murder investigation with Harry heats up, she gets the order to turn it over to a different unit. Never one to follow the letter of the law (on occasion, she's been known to stomp on it), Renee refuses to let go, although she and Harry try to stay under the radar while they try to find a link between his 2011 case and the current shooting.Much more than that I can't say without revealing too much, except that it's a thoroughly engrossing adventure that I didn't want to put down until I had to - and even then, I polished it off in two days of spare time. In short, another one well done and highly recommended!"
205,5.0,"I was happy to see a new book in the Harry Bosch (and Renee Ballard) series at the bookstore and The Dark Hours did not disappoint. It's particularly impressive that Connelly wrote the book during the pandemic--a time when the framework environment for a mystery/thriller of what was ""normal"" was so drastically changed.Ballard is a great, strong protagonist and Harry has a series-developed role as her knowledgeable, trustworthy, (all the characteristics we readers appreciate about him) loyal, still-tough mentor.A few points I didn't like, that date the book, and that take readers too far out of the story/may not appeal to half or more of the audience: author scolding via the protagonist about vaccines (p. 155) and (for a book set in Los Angeles) commentary about the Jan. 6, 2021 (Washington DC) protest (p. 309+)--but no equivalent mention of the rampage of summer 2020 looting and rioting throughout the US. By contrast, the 'defund the police' movement is highlighted appropriately--simply presented as yet another hurdle for LAPD officers. John Grisham has said it is much harder to write nonfiction than fiction: these examples show the dangers of trying to blend in non-fiction/political views. Readers want a credible story, not lectures. And, since books are all about language, Connelly or his editor missed a word early on: ""diffuse"" was substituted for ""defuse."" FWIW, the California-specific pandemic rules come through when Ballard gets out of her car and immediately (even though she is outside!) puts on her mask.In the end, these are minor details that took me out of the story at a few points, but the plot, subplot, characters, and settings make this another Michael Connelly book well worth reading.Highly recommended."
206,4.0,"The Dark Hours is the fourth novel to feature detective Renee Ballard, & is my favourite featuring her so far. Michael Connelly keeps the reader gripped with two separate investigations in another fine police procedural.Although the legendary/aging/retired detective Harry Bosch is involved in the story the focus is much more on Ballard & Connelly develops her character nicely. It would be good to see Harry Bosch go out in a blaze of glory in one final novel rather than have him sidelined as a support character. This probbaly won't happen as I expect Connelly has a great attachment to the character, as well as the money he brings in. Over the years Michael Connelly has written some superb Bosch novels, but I think it's time for Ballard to take over for a new generation (& an old one, like me!) of readers."
207,4.0,"Connelly's plotting is completely formulaic, with most of his books ending the same way. Still, I liked the LA pandemic setting, and Ballard's perspective on it. "

211,2.0,"I have been a fan of Michael Connelly for many, many years. I have enjoyed Harry Bosch and have read every single book in his series. I've also read all of the spin off series. We all knew that Harry was getting older and realistically there was going to be a limit to how much longer his character was going to be able to continue. So, I thought the teaming up with Renee Ballard was a smart idea.Unfortunately, this is another author who has made the decision to insert the woke politics of today and certain views on masks, the vaccine, defund the police and BLM into the story. I lost count of how many times ""masks"" were mentioned. Either being put on, taken off, describing the masks by color - even the people who chose not to wear one. It was so often and at times, so very not relevant to whatever was happening on the page. It does truly pull the reader out of the story. The inclusion of the ""hate Trump"" graffiti, the January ""insurrection"", the BLM ""protestors” (rioters) and many, many other similar events just seemed superfluous and wasn't really necessary for the story. I'm not sure why it was needed- especially since this entire series has been a police procedural series that have centered on the actions and cases of a cop and the LAPD. Besides that, I have grown to really like Harry. Harry Bosch was a cop. He devoted his entire life to the LAPD and was already screwed enough by them. Now, we have the police department shown in an even more horrible light. Who knows, maybe the LAPD is completely corrupt, but it seems to take everything that Harry worked for and believed in and throw it back in our face.Anyway, that is neither here nor there. That was just an observation. I didn't find the plot and the story itself up to what we have come to expect from Mr. Connelly. I didn't finish the last page with a feeling of accomplishment on the part of the protagonists. I really felt just...sad.There is enough going on in the real world today that I don't want to come away from a book feeling even worse. I'm hoping this was just a one off and that we can get back to what made the series great in the first place. If not, it might be time to say goodbye to this series. But...I truly hope not."
212,4.0,"On the one hand, it was another good case (actually two) for Ballard and Bosch. On the other, it was a horrible indictment on how screwed up our world has really become in LA and the rest of the country."
213,5.0,"I’ve said it before, but it’s true. There is no classier an act than Michael Connelly. His books are sublime. Like any artist, the pictures he draws have depth and range; his characters are three dimensional and everything is contextualised in the brush strokes; none of it heavy handed, but in a few strokes conveying the light and shade that gives meaning to what you are reading over and above a skilled and layered plot.In The Dark Hours, Renee Ballard is finding it tough going. The protests against police brutality and racism following the death of George Floyd and the impact of the close-following pandemic has led to a bigger breakdown of public trust in the police than she has known before. The events surrounding the Capitol in January have been so disturbing that it is hard to understand what is happening to American civil society, other than it is substantially less civil than it felt before.The police are finding difficult to do their jobs and many are simply not bothering to do more than go through the motions. The malaise is impacting on Ballard’s assigned partner and so for much of this case, she is on her own.It’s New Year’s Eve and Detective Renée Ballard is quietly cursing the insanity of those who celebrate by firing their weapons in the air. A man has died after this ‘celebration’ but it is soon clear that this – the first murder of the year -was no accident. By rights she should pass this case over. She’s not on the murder squad; instead she and her partner are working a serial rape case, sitting waiting for the next victim in the hope that they can find similarities that will allow them to track the perpetrators. But Ballard wants this murder case and she has found a connection between it and one that Harry Bosch worked more than a decade ago.If Ballard’s partner is lazy and all too often missing in action, Bosch, whom Ballard has worked with before, is the opposite. He may be retired, but he hates to let a cold case go unsolved and Ballard knows he’s as dogged and determined as any policeman.In The Dark Hours Ballard is working both the serial rapist case whose perpetrators have been tagged ‘The Midnight Men’ and the homicide with Harry Bosch lending a hand and his expertise. She also has to contend with departmental politics and some on the LAPD team who still resent her for speaking out about unacceptable harassment.Connelly laces his utterly gripping police procedural with some well-placed observations about the current state of America. Not just what’s happening to the Police, but the growing homelessness epidemic, and the growing problem of an unregulated, unchecked dark web where the worst of all aspects of manhood goes to fester and suppurate until it boils over into unchecked rage and criminal action.Ballard is a smart and determined cop and she is prepared to work all the angles to find the answers to both these crimes. Doing so will endanger her job and her life and cause her to question everything that is important to her. Bosch, despite his brush with serious illness is still mentally agile and a great silent partner to Ballard, using his extensive memory and cold case files to assist and ensuring she has back up when required. They are a terrific team who understand each other and work well together.Verdict: I got more of a sense of Renee Ballard in this book than ever before and as a consequence she has become more likeable and more admirable. This partnership has fast become unmissable and I really hope that there will be many more to follow. Michael Connelly is such a fantastic writer and these books encapsulate the essence of the best of police procedurals, married with fantastic characterisation, well–layered plotting and a sense of the state of America today that is both riveting and worrying. It is to be hoped that these dark hours are coming just before the dawn…A top class, five star outing not to be missed."
214,4.0,"4.5 stars. Michael Connelly is one of my go-to authors. If I want or need to be glued into a book, he’s the one I go for and luckily this came in from holdlist at just the right time. A very creepy read re a pair of serial rapists who work together pulled me right in and left me creeped out at night - but not creeped out enough to ever put the book down. I just love Renee Ballard and the combo of her and Bosch together is just fab imo. I was thinking about picking up a different book after this but I may just go for another Connelly. ( I’m still trying to read all of the Bosch series for the first time, a situation I’m pretty happy about, because I can always find a Connelly I’ve not yet read!)This loses half a star bc the ending felt a bit rushed and also just slightly implausible in a couple of ways but all in all I loved this book and the audio version was also well done. Two thumbs up!"
215,2.0,usually enjoyed his storiesI believe the writer put in the story on his opinions regarding covid vaccine and insight into what happened inside the police situations.
216,5.0,"Another excellent read from Michael Connelly. Great characters, gripping plot. Renee Ballard's character and career continue to develop convincingly. The book's very current, being set in 2020, with real life events being referenced.A very enjoyable read. "
217,5.0,"I look forward to Michael Connelly books with even greater anticipation in this extended period of Corona Virus and the never ending summer of global warming writ large. I now read to mentally escape flash floods, fires, and heatwaves. Lucky for me THE DARK HOURS provided plenty of distraction. This is really a Renee Ballard book with Harry Bosch providing assistance on the edges of two cases; much as Bosch fans might wish it otherwise. Ballard is up to the task and has now become a strong enough character in her own right that she carries the book. But the real strength in this book is Connelly’s ability to weave the present into the atmosphere of the LAPD. If readers are struggling with issues, than consider the police having experienced everything, and then some. Connelly makes it real for his characters as Ballard struggles to work cases without much support from burned out cops reluctant to leave precincts. When Ballard decides to solve the cases on her own, she sets the stage for a showdown with her superiors. Bosch has a few things to say about her methods, as you might imagine. The book is a great addition to the Bosch Universe. I received my copy from the publisher through NetGalley."
218,5.0,"***See this full review, and more, on TheRealBookSpy.com ***#1 New York Times bestselling author Michael Connelly brings back his new hero, LAPD Detective Renee Ballard, and longtime protagionist former detective, Harry Bosh—once again teaming them up as the duo takes on two cases that’ll keep readers reading well into the night. It’s called “the rain of lead,” and has become a New Year’s Eve tradition in Las Angelas. Just before midnight, partiers take to the streets and ring in the new year by firing their guns into the air. It’s all harmless until it’s not, and for LAPD detective Renée Ballard, the new year starts off with a case involving an auto shop owner named Javier Raffa who was hit with a stray bullet in the middle of the street. Still working the graveyard shift (following 2019’s The Night Fire), Ballard gets the call and arrives at the scene expecting to find that Raffa—who throws a yearly shindig that draws plenty of Las Palmas gang members—was hit with a stray bullet. But after poking around, Ballard . . . .Continue reading this review here: https://therealbookspy.com/2021/10/18..."
219,4.0,"It’s New Year’s Eve 2021 and COVID-19 is in full effect. LAPD Detective Renee Ballard and Harry Bosch team up in search of a serial killer duo in Los Angeles called the Midnight Men. Another murder takes place under the cover of the typical “gunfire in the air” that occurs as the clock strikes 12 in L.A. Are these 2 cases related somehow? Ballard and Bosch are determined to solve it!Michael Connelly is a truly exceptional author and THE DARK HOURS is a great addition to his collection of outstanding novels. I can really appreciate that he incorporated all of the important current events of 2020 in the storyline, such as COVID-19, Black Lives Matter, and Defund the Police protests. This gave the book a unique style that kept it very interesting despite the fact that I have read many of Connelly’s books. Another great read with some of your favorite repeat characters!Many thanks to NetGalley and Little, Brown and Company for my ARC in exchange for my honest review.This review will be posted to my Instagram Blog (@coffee.break.book.reviews) in the near future."
221,4.0,"Since Harry Bosch’s retirement from the LAPD, Renée Ballard has kind of taken over the Bosch fanbase – especially as she still gets Bosch to mentor her, on especially tough cases. Here, on New Year’s Eve 2020, Ballard and her partner in the graveyard shift get a call to attend an accidental shooting case. But when they reach there, it seems like a wilful homicide. Ballard and her partner are also working on the Midnight Men case, where a tag team of two are assaulting women at their home, while they were sleeping.The shooting case ties into another case from a decade ago, which Bosch had handled but couldn’t get a solve. So, when Ballard’s partner skips town to spend a weekend away, she contacts Bosch to assist with her case, particularly on a case where he had not been able to get the murderer. Another rollicking ride from the master of the Police procedural – Michael Connelly!

222,2.0,"Not His Best!I've never given Mr. Connelly only two stars before. I love any novel about Bosch, and have anxiously awaited this one. I just don't like Ballard at all. She thinks she's the only decent cop. She should take a look at herself. She plays by her own rules, but condemns others for it. I almost didn't finish this one. That's a first for me. I'd like to see more Haller and Bosch!"
223,4.0,"I'm a big Connelly fan which, naturally makes me a fan of Bosch. But, Ballard gets most of the action in the joint series so some fans will be disappointed. Still, what makes Connelly so popular is his ability to draw you in, keep you guessing and moving the story along briskly and he manages that again in this one.Interesting the folks that want to attack the book on political grounds as they do other authors like Steven King. Maybe someday they will figure it out than most authors are educated, intelligent, and analytical which leads them to conclude that it is probably better to trust the science rather than the fringe of conspiracy nuts and this may be reflected in their writing. By the way, the critic who commented that the ""vaccines don't work"", have you an explanation why 99% of the most recent hospitalizations for Covid are among the non-vaccinated?"
224,1.0,"I discovered Michael Connelly’s books this year, and I read almost all of his books, whenever I could escape to the action-packed world of Harry Bosch, Mikey Haller, Jack McEvoy and Renee Ballard. I was looking forward to reading his new current-time novel so much that I preordered it months ago. I started reading The Dark Hours today, and I was not able to get through the first few pages of political propaganda: presenting the police as a victim of the last years’ events, blaming the defund the police movement (and not the incompetent leadership or purchase of military equipment) for not having enough well trained detectives, then repeating again these accusations…Connelly is great describing crime plots and process of detective work. I knew that his renditions of deep emotional interactions are less convincing (ex: Nine Dragons); now I’ll list political-economic reasoning as his weakness too.ADD:I tried to return to book, but I couldn’t. So, I have to admit it, I speed-read it. Interesting story, but many plot holes (no-spoiler example: where did the killers get their car?), uncharacteristic actions (Renee Ballard suspects something, presents as certainty to others, then shows up unprepared) and unrealistic ending. I am standing by my rating.(It is interesting that other readers found this book’s tone too liberal, even “woke” - perhaps because the socio-political thoughts in it are contrived, forced, inconsistent.)"
225,5.0,Read it in one day - two sittings. Excellent story.
226,5.0,"I’m a big Michael Connelly fan, especially of anything featuring Harry Bosch, and now his sort of unofficial partner, Renee Ballard. Bosch is a retired LAPD homicide detective, and Ballard is a current detective working the night shift. Ballard catches a New Year’s Eve murder featuring a bullet to the back of the head, and ballistics reveal a connection to an unsolved homicide Bosch worked a decade earlier, so she gives Bosch a call to pick his brain. She’s also working a case involving a (rare) two-man team of rapists who break into their victims’ homes late in the night, dubbed the Midnight Men. This novel is set very much in the current moment: the Covid pandemic is raging, and Black Lives Matter protests have led to de facto police defunding and widespread distrust of police. In turn, a malaise has affected the department, and most cops have turned resentful and are doing the bare minimum to get by. The partnership and respect between Bosch and Ballard continues to grow and deepen, and Ballard’s expertise and ethic come more and more to the fore. One suspects Connelly will retire Bosch as a character one day soon (he’s currently about 70, I think, and fighting chronic leukemia he picked up from exposure to radiation in a previous story in which he prevented the launch of a dirty bomb). I think Ballard is being cued up as an equally engaging and competent lone wolf cop, a worthy successor to Bosch."
227,5.0,"I have been eagerly awaiting the fourth book - The Dark Hours - in Michael Connelly's Ballard and Bosch novels. And IMO, this is the best one yet!It's New Year's Eve and Renée is again working the night shift - by choice. By tradition, revelers shoot their guns into the air at midnight in Los Angeles. Sounds like a recipe for disaster doesn't it? Uh huh, it results in one of the first homicides of the new year. Here's the thing - the bullet may be tied to an unsolved case - one worked by Harry Bosch. Now retired, Bosch has become a mentor and a sometime off the books partner of Renée. I'm always so happy to see Harry again. He's like an old war horse that just keeps riding into battle. His experience, (usually) calm demeanor and drive for answers and justice keep him going. ""Everybody counts or nobody counts"" Renée is fearless and has that same drive for justice. Her determination has not endeared her to her fellow cops. Connelly has woven current events and happenings and the turbulent state of policing and politics into the narrative. While others do just the bare minimum, Renée never lets up. In addition to the New Year's Eve case, she's also trying to find a pair of serial rapists who've been labeled as The Midnight Men. A lot goes on on the late show....Connelly's crime novels are second to none. The characters, the settings, the details, the plotting - all of it makes for fantastic reading. And yes, lots of action. The dynamic between these two really works. In the final pages, I thought I saw where the Ballard and Bosch books might be headed in the fifth book, but Connelly throws in an alternative. I can't wait to see which way things end up. Highly recommended!"
228,5.0,"Besides having a typically creative Michael Connelly plot, this is a book that could be read in 50 years that would give the reader an accurate portrayal of current times. I think the background of the story is a perfect snapshot of the upside-down early pandemic era, the anxiety of post 2020 election unrest and the additional circumstances that have created frustration and low morale for law enforcement officers. it’s a great police procedural and a logical development of the feisty Renee Ballard character and her relationship with Harry Bosch. My only regret is that the book ended and that there will be a long wait for the next one."
229,5.0,"Excellent book with two plot lines. The final chapters bring up things that are too real and scary. Since it is written during the pandemic, Mr. Connelly relates it very well to real life problems and issues. I have read all of his books and of course watched the entire TV series ""Bosch"" on Amazon Prime. Reading all of the books before the TV series, I didn't picture in my mind Titus Welliver as Bosch but watching the series he plays Bosch very well. And I really like the actress chosen for Maddie. At my age, I just wish the books came out faster---I read them the same day, then I have to wait a year for the next book."
230,5.0,Great.
231,1.0,"This novel demonstrates just how far the USA has fallen in the last 2 years, but not at all, unless I missed some really well hidden sarcasm, in the way Michael Connelly intended."
232,5.0,"I’m a BIG Michael Connelly fan. Recently, I have enjoyed 2020’s Law of Innocence, (he latest “Lincoln Lawyer” novel featuring Mickey Haller) and Fair Warning (with Jack McEvoy from The Poet and Scarecrow books), but have been eagerly awaiting more of Detective Renee Ballard, introduced in 2017’s The Late Show. The strong female protagonist always appealed to me, and the combination of Detective Ballard and retiree Harry Bosch is terrific! In Connelly’s latest, The Dark Hours, Ballard is back! No longer sleeping in a tent on the beach when she isn’t crashing briefly with family, Renee has an actual apartment and is looking for a new dog to replace her former tentmate and protector. She is still working the night shift, and as the story opens, it is New Years Eve and she is temporarily partnered with Lisa from Sex Crimes, working the case of the “Midnight Men”, serial rapists who have been terrorizing women in L.A. A call comes in about a death possibly caused by one of the many falling bullets that come down after being shot into the air in celebration of the start of the New Year (or perhaps the end of the past year, which has been a tough one for the everyone, but even more so for police, with both the pandemic and the anti-police feelings going strong throughout the community). Lisa displays a serious lack of work ethic, which aggravates Ballard, even though she gets it: “After a year of pandemic and anti-police sentiment, commitment to the job was sometimes hard to find.” Both issues (pandemic and anti-police sentiment) are deftly woven throughout the story, and Connelly superbly captures Renee’s frustration as she deals with what seems like a lack of support from fellow cops, too burned out to want to even leave the precinct, let alone seriously pursue solid leads. Fortunately for Renee, one of her leads goes straight to a cold case that was handled back in the day by none other than Harry Bosch, someone with whom Renee has a history of tackling sticky situations in a slightly unorthodox way. I love Renee’s struggle as she tries valiantly to work the cases despite challenges that are exacerbated by departmental politics intertwined with current social and public health issues. “It sometimes seemed to her as though the biggest barricades in the so-called justice system were on the inside, before you even got out the door.” Although there is some resolution to the cases Renee is working so hard to solve, the story ends with a bit of a question as to what is next for Renee, both personally and professionally. Here’s hoping she and Harry Bosch are back soon with another outstanding entry in this series. Five stars, and thanks to Little, Brown and NetGalley for a copy in exchange for this honest review."
233,5.0,"I received a copy of The Dark Hours from Allen & Unwin Australia to review.The master of crime fiction, bestselling author Michael Connelly, returns with another outstanding Ballard and Bosch novel, The Dark Hours, which sets his iconic protagonists on another intense and captivating case.As the clock ticks down the last seconds of 2020, the citizens of Los Angeles celebrate New Year’s Eve in their typical chaotic way, with hundreds of celebrators firing guns up into the air, with a rain of bullets coming down shortly after. Sheltering under a bridge, LAPD detective Renée Ballard is staking out the nearby neighbourhood in hopes of catching a team of rapists terrorising women during the holidays. However, she instead finds herself called to the scene of a party where an auto shop owner has been fatally hit in the head with a bullet.Initially assuming that the death was an accident brought on by the lateral bullets fired in celebration, Ballard soon discovers that the shooting occurred at point-blank range, indicating that someone used the revels to disguise their up-close murder. Starting her investigation, Ballard soon discovers that the same gun was used in an unsolved murder case which had been investigated by her friend and mentor, retired LAPD detective Harry Bosch.Working with Bosch, Ballard soon finds herself on the trail of a dangerous killer who may have killed many times before and is at the centre of a deadly conspiracy. Determined to catch this killer before the case is taken away from her, Ballard is willing to break any rule to catch her suspect, no matter the danger to herself or her career. At the same time, Ballard becomes obsessed with catching the team of rapists destroying lives in her city, but finds herself fighting against a demoralised and uncaring police department, more concerned with maintaining their image than police work. Can Ballard and Bosch solve these latest crimes before it is too late, or will the predators they stalk land another fatal strike?This was another incredible book from Connelly that contains a clever and captivating murder mystery that I deeply enjoyed. The Dark Hours has a fantastic story to it, that not only takes the reader on an intense and particularly dark couple of cases but which also explores the state of policing in 2021. A brilliant and powerful read, this was an excellent Connelly novel that gets a full five-star rating from me.To see the full review, click on the link below:https://unseenlibrary.com/2021/11/15/...For other exciting reviews and content, check out my blog at:https://unseenlibrary.com/"
234,4.0,"4.5 starsThe quality of Connelly's work in the police procedural novel can never be questioned. Of course it's another excellent read. Renee Ballard is the lead character here, with a supporting role from Bosch. Two intriguing cases running parallel - a shooting and a rape case - whilst Ballard also battles with internal issues within the LAPD. "
235,4.0,The Dark Hours by Michael Connelly is the 4th book in his Ballard & Bosch series.“Ballard seeks shelter on New Year’s Eve to avoid the shower of lead from the guns fired in celebration. She is called out to a scene where someone has been shot. She ties it back to a cold case that Bosch investigated. They think it’s a cop. This time he knows someone is after him.”This is a bleak LA Police force that Bosch writes about. Covid and social unrest have driven many of the officers inside and away from solving crimes - many just putting their time in until retirement. Ballard is different. She just wants to catch bad guys - even when it’s not her responsibility. Connelly weaves another case in that has a wild ending also. There’s some surprising news about Bosch. Connelly gives us more great crime fiction.
236,5.0,"I love the team of Ballard and Bosch. Connelly has written another exciting book about their involvement in 2 major cases. I enjoy the relationship between these two. Ballard is a rebel and a professional which is constantly getting her into trouble with the LAPD. When a former cop turns up in the middle of a murder investigation, she finds herself a pariah in the force. Even more fascinating is her brave and careful involvement in the series of rapes by a team known as the “Midnight Men”. Sure, we have to suspend disbelief as we follow this pair. I must say I enjoyed every page. I can’t wait to see how Connelly positions Ballard and Bosch for their futures. Thank you Netgalley for allowing me to review another remarkable Connelly book."
237,4.0,"I received this as an Advance Read Copy (to be published Nov. 2021). It is one of Connelly's best! The world is dealing with Covid, masks, protests, and calls to defund the police. While Renee investigates a New Year's Eve murder made to look like an accident, she also becomes involved in a case involving serial rapists -- yes, a team of two. Once again, she finds that the retired Harry Bosch is the best partner she could have. Connelly is a master."
238,5.0,"Welp, I blew through that in about three hours.This is the 4th Renee Ballard book, the 23rd Harry Bosch book, the 35th entry in the HBU – Harry Bosch Universe – and the third time that Ballard and Bosch have teamed up. And I will add that for a series that is entering its third decade, Connelly is on fire here.Which brings me to the theme that he has decided to explore with the Ballard books – all of the titles of the books featuring her (The Late Show, Dark Sacred Night, Night Fire, The Dark Hours) involve the things that happen in the city under cover of darkness. Renee Ballard herself is a graveyard detective, a woman who haunts the night and tries to stave off the evil that men (and it is mostly men) do to one another, and to women, after the sun goes down.Harry himself is frankly old at this point. He is in remission from leukemia, stemming from exposure to radioactive materials in The Overlook. His battle with the LAPD, however, is not over. Ballard teams up with him again when she pulls a murder on New Years Eve 2020, which has a tie to a cold case that Bosch had worked.As always, there are two cases. The NYE murder is one, and the second is a pair of serial rapists known as the Midnight Men, who committed their third (reported) rape on New Year’s Eve.This is an ambitious book. LAPD is in crisis following the pandemic and a summer of protests. The police and the community are, often, working at cross-purposes, and the city government is poorly managing the public safety needs. Ballard herself is unsure if she wants to remain with the department, and many of her best colleagues have left, leaving behind a police force that is depleted and nearly paralyzed. Crime is up all over the city.
It was an example of how protesters demanding the defunding of the police department had achieved their goal in an indirect way. The move to defund was turned away by the city’s politicians, but the police department had burned through its budget in dealing with the protests that followed the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. After weeks of tactical alert and associated costs, the department was out of money and the result was freezes on hiring, the disbanding of units, and the end of several programs. In effect, the department had been defunded in several key areas.
Connelly is talking about an LAPD in need of reform, but unable to move forward. And he’s talking about what happens in communities when violence becomes an uninterrupted pattern. He’s writing about what happens in places where everyone has ceased to care.The book takes the well-worn path of a police procedural. The murder is solved first, and exposes the rot that festers deep within institutions when protecting the institution becomes a goal that is deemed more important that protecting the vulnerable. And by pure hard police work, Ballard solves the serial rape at, potentially, the cost of her career. She will never be content to just phone it in, and the LAPD has become a place where that type of police work puts a target on her back.The book ends perfectly, with a question mark. Is she in, or is she out?"
239,5.0,"Okay, this one confirmed for me that Connelly is the grandmaster of police procedurals and no one does it better than him. I think I like this one more than both Dark Sacred Night and The Night Fire, probably because it's primarily a Ballard novel, not a Ballard and Bosch novel as advertised, I mean... Bosch was much more prominent in The Reversal and it wasn't even called a Haller and Bosch novel, it was just a Haller book. And the reason I like this one more than the last two isn't that I like Ballard more than Bosch in any way. It's just that both DSN and TNF were more or less cut in half and shared between Ballard and Bosch, making them not complete Ballard and Bosch novels but a mishmash of two half novels. So when I say The Dark Hours is a Ballard novel, I mean it feels like a complete novel, not shared between two important characters who both need their own space and effort. Therefore it feels more natural, more developed, in a way a like direct follow up to The Late Show, because once again it's completely Ballard's show. She has the space to herself now that there isn't a lot of Bosch and it really works. In turn, there is very little of Bosch and I'm not really okay with that. I really want to see a solo Bosch novel, or at least Connelly can do for Bosch what he did for Ballard here and make her some kind of supporting character at least for one more book. Because Bosch is getting really old and I don't want him to just leave everything to Ballard and completely retire or possibly die of old age. We deserve a solo Bosch book, even if it's going to be the last one we ever get. "
240,2.0,"I have a HUGE problem with this book. It's not a Harry Bosch book, it's a Renee Ballard book. I read this book believing it was a HB book. It was like ordering a cheese/mushroom pizza and the pizza arrives with plenty of cheese and 1 mushroom. This book is a RB book. It's all about Renee, Harry is like a bad Xmas ornament hidden on the back of the tree. I wish Mr. Connelly would have said it's a RB book with a few visits from Harry. On it's own it's an okay book. I enjoyed the first three books about RB but I was so looking forward to a Harry book and then realized I was catfished. This book is really about getting us hooked on Renee and using Harry as the hook. It's not a bad book and I finished it in 2 days but I really wanted a book where Harry is the star and not a side kick to stand outside the car. It's an easy read and I didn't buy the ending but oh well. "
241,2.0,"None of these Renee Ballard novels have been very good. Not only is she an uninteresting character, but she’s been given some of Michael Connelly’s least inspired cases. Here she (and Bosch) are juggling two cases that come together anticlimactically, without many twists or turns. In the background, the author wades his toes into current events regarding police (de-)funding and reform, but, surely not wanting to alienate the audience who read these books as copaganda, uses Ballard to point out problem areas while remaining apolitical and non-committal. Connelly more successfully incorporates details of pandemic life. However, there are parts that feel a bit like every awkwardly mundane conversation I’ve had upon reemergence into the world: “so, the last two years have been crazy, huh?” Anyway, it’s fine for what it is, but I wish he’d give Ballard more personality and/or more to work with. Edit: after discussing this with my dumb books for smart people book club (Spencer), I’ve dropped the rating out of fairness to the hundred other books I gave three stars this year. "
242,4.0,"I really like Renee Ballard. She’s smart, calm and cool and use her brain than emotion.There are two cases for Renee to crack in The Dark Hours and both are equally interesting but the book gave the majority time to the murder case. Anyway, Ballard did a great job for an MC, I love her character."
243,5.0,Harry Bosch will never get too old to entertain us and Renee Ballard makes for a good partner. 
244,4.0,The main character in this entertaining book was Renee Ballard. Although Bosch only makes cameo appearances he’s a must in keeping this story going. Usually can’t go wrong with Michael Connelly stories.
245,1.0,"This one felt like it was just mailed in. It didn't make me care about either Bosch or Ballard. There was almost no character development, other than a potential new boyfriend for Ballard. Harry was a cardboard character. It was hard to keep track of what, exactly, Ballard was doing as she worked two cases and apparently went days without sleep, yet functioned fully. He also threw in more than the normal number of acronyms, then explaining them in the next paragraph, which was just disrupting. Finaly, the references to Covid were distracting and unnecessary, as were the political references. I read this for pleasure and to escape."
246,5.0,"Typically excellent Michael Connelly. He perfectly balances two plot threads - one, the death of a former gang banger on New Year's eve, and the other, a case of serial rape. In this 4th outing with Renee Ballard she and Bosch work vey well together. He's like the necessary, all knowing ghost in the background, his meticulous work pairing nicely with hers. My only caveat was a needless woman in jep (alone in a dark house) scene at the end. It was handled well but I wish that bit hadn't been there. However, a great, impossible to put down read. "
247,1.0,Yet another casualty of the current narrative; how incredibly disappointing. Will be saving my money.
248,4.0,4+ stars
249,5.0,"I'm always up for a book that involves Harry, and I really like Renee as well. I have to say that I read a few series, and Michael Connelly is the only writer I've read who is really dealing with the pandemic in his books. I was surprised by the inclusion of how hard it was on the police force of a major city, and think that inclusion makes some excellent points. The mention of the Capital riots as well, had me remembering those days."
250,5.0,"""The Dark Hours"" is an exceptional novel. In fact, I think it's the best novel Michael Connelly has written to date, and I am quite sure I've read them all. It's a great mystery – make it two mysteries, one about a pair of serial rapists, the other about a New Year's Eve shooting in Hollywood that unfolds into a much larger case – but the book is much, much more than a clever procedural.Connelly has found a way to write about every major theme in today's society: violence, obviously, and violence against women, also obviously, but also public attitudes towards the police after the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020, cops' increasing sense of remove from their own mission as public trust erodes in the police force, misogyny in the workforce and at home, the sense of divide in America that led to the most contentious election ever and culminated in the horrible, criminal insurrection in January of 2021, and, of course, the pandemic. The book starts on New Year's Eve of 2020 and covers the next several days, so it's a world where most people are still not vaccinated and some are refusing to wear masks – and everyone's nerves are frayed and fraying. Lest anyone is put off by the above, don't be. The book is not a diatribe or an aggressively political statement; it's a police procedural featuring two great characters, Reneé Ballard (in her fourth outing from Connelly) and Harry Bosch (whom I hope lives forever). It has tremendous procedural chops; Connelly always does his homework on that front. And, once again, Connelly proves that he is the noir poet of Los Angeles. But he has also made ""The Dark Hours"" into a ""state of the nation"" novel, one that reflects and refracts a broad swath of contemporary life. This is a really great book. "
251,5.0,"Every year like clockwork Michael Connelly come sup with another and sometimes even two, incredible books. How does he do it, how does he keep so fresh and full of ideas so that the new book is as good if not better than its predecessors?Perhaps it is perhaps he is not afraid to freshen things up and introduce new characters. Renee Ballard is to new to us readers but she is developing as a character in every book and she is beginning to resemble her mentor Harry Bosch more and more in terms of her attitude and doggedness.Thos is yet another wonderful book and totally topical in its mention son covid and BLM amongst other matters.I will not provide spoilers but simply say that if you want an impeccably written and researched literary thriller and police procedural then this is for you."
252,5.0,"Michael Connelly just gets better and better. In this fourth entry in his Rene Ballard/Harry Bosch series he seamlessly interweaves two sets of crime - murder and rape -- with contemporary social issues that encompass the coronavirus pandemic, sexual harassment,homelessness, the role of the police in today's culture and the result of recent events on both society's and internal police reactions, the January 6 insurrection, and more. Connelly keeps the reader in suspense as the focus sharpens on Ballard and her resistance to her colleagues who take the easy road instead of the hard work of actually solving their cases. There is plenty of action but it never overwhelms the flow of the story. There are times when Connelly paints Ballard with a bit more heroism than seems plausible, but that is just a minor nitpick. The Dark Hours is by far Connelly's best book and readers will be eager to get their hands on a copy.Thanks to NetGalley and Little Brown and Co. for providing an advance readers copy in exchange for an objective review."
253,5.0,"This is my favourite long running series of books. It is fascinating how Michael Connelly has managed to keep the series running - Harry Bosch's 35th episode and Renee Ballard's 4th. I felt as though Ballard was the central lead character in this book, with Bosch taking more of a secondary role. I think that's OK - after all, she is the one who is employed by the police department whilst he has supposedly retired.The storyline starts with a rape case and quickly turns to a fatal shooting - two separate cases which Ballard is determined to keep working herself. This is all set against a timeline of 2020 into 2021 with the covid pandemic ongoing. It is very current, very believable, fast paced and absorbing.Very highly recommended.Thank you to NetGalley for an early copy in exchange for an honest review."
254,5.0,"Long time fan of this author, and I love the Renee Ballard series. She is such a badass. Great story.Great characters. Curious as to where she will end up. Note that I did receive a free copy of this book. "
255,3.0,"I have mixed emotions about this entry in the Renee Ballard-Harry Bosch partnership, part of Michael Connelly's masterful plan to extend Harry's career as a detective by making him a mentor to a young cop consigned to working night-shift cases.Ballard is an interesting character -- a good detective but a loner, a surfer, and until recently, technically homeless. She goes through a lot of changes in this novel. She's forced by the pandemic (which closes the beach where she has a tent) to finally get an apartment, forced by the death of her longtime pet to adopt another dog, forced by an on-the-job injury to meet an eligible bachelor EMT with the ironic name Single.And she winds up with her life in jeopardy not once but twice -- once by surprise, the second time because of her own recklessness. Even Harry tells her she's being stupid about that second one, and she ignores his advice.She also, as Harry often did, gets cross-wise with her superior officer, although she doesn't throw him through the glass window of his office the way Harry once did. The two have a lot in common. She also has a few snarky encounters with an officious HOA president that made me snicker when she got the best of the guy.But unlike Harry, Ballard sometimes seems to go out of her way to create conflict, both with her fellow officers and her boss. She makes a lot of noise about caring about victims, but when one texts her a dismaying message, she fails to call the woman back. Her survival at the end of the book seems almost more like luck than skill. That bothered me a lot.So did some of the discussion about Black Lives Matter and defunding the police. Connelly sets this novel in the first six weeks of 2021, so BLM, the pandemic and the Jan. 6 insurrection are all a backdrop for this story of a modern murder that ties into an old one, and a pair of ruthless rapists nicknamed the Midnight Men. Connelly's use of the pandemic as a backdrop to his last Mickey Haller novel was a brilliant touch, because it gave it a tension beyond just a murder plot. But here the ripped-from-the-headlines backdrop makes some of the characters -- including the main one -- less sympathetic. I wondered, for instance, about the depiction of one minor character, an ambulance-chaser attorney, as someone who has a BLM poster in his window. That bothered me, as did some of the comments made about how the protests had depressed police morale so that they didn't want to do anything. If that's not an indictment of the police department -- oh gosh, don't criticize them or they won't wan tto do their jobs! -- then I don't know what is. The book ends on a cliffhanger about Ballard's future, and I am sure I will read the next Bosch-Ballard adventure, if only because Connelly is so good at creating believable police procedurals. But I am not sure a new dog and a new boyfriend will make me all that invested in Ballard's future if Harry's no longer able to continue as her guiding light in the dark hours."
256,4.0,"“Ballard would be left alone to work in the dark hours. It was exactly the way she wanted it.”Don’t talk to LAPD Detective Renée Ballard about doing anything but the midnight shift, where she could mostly work alone and have less bureaucracy to get in the way of doing her job. At one point in THE DARK HOURS, Michael Connelly’s latest thriller, Ballard’s lieutenant tries to reward her with a transfer to the day shift. She promptly rebukes the offer, letting him know that she is perfectly happy staying on the dark side and would prefer simple praise for a job well done over anyone messing with her schedule.There is perhaps no author working today who writes a police procedural quite like Michael Connelly. His language is just gritty enough to provide the right amount of credibility needed for readers to believe that they are listening to actual discussions that might take place both on the street and back at the squad room. He also is a master of dialogue who infuses his characters with enough straight talk, most likely taken from his years as a reporter, that it instantly creates three-dimensional, realistic figures on the page.However, THE DARK HOURS is a different animal from anything Connelly has previously written. The pandemic, which unfortunately still exists in our world, has posed a great quandary to authors. Do they deal with the elephant in the room and write about it, or do they completely ignore it and give their readers an escape from their day-to-day worries? Connelly has chosen the former, and it plays well. We get to see a police force that is barely respected by the public. We also witness a mix of PTSD and lack of enthusiasm from the squad itself, which makes the matter of expecting assistance from your colleagues yet another river to cross.The action begins on New Year’s Eve when law enforcement is already on guard for problems all over the map. Ballard believes that what goes up must come down, meaning that every new year in the City of Angels begins with risk. This year kicks off with the murder of local business owner Javier Raffa, a hard-working auto mechanic. Ballard finds instant evidence of his affiliation with a local street gang, Las Palmas, which made him a target for death at any time.A bunch of homicides that occurred on or about the same time may or may not be related. An elderly couple was robbed and set on fire in West Hollywood, and a couple of home break-ins involved rape. This makes Ballard and everyone in her department think about the Midnight Men, a fiendish pair of serial rapists who have been terrorizing women and leaving no trace. As part of the investigation, Ballard calls up an open cold case from now-retired Detective Harry Bosch, with whom she already has a working relationship.As Bosch assists Ballard in her current cases, they spend time following up with the home break-in/rape victims to see what common threads they can put together. This will involve going back to the first known victim of the Midnight Men, Bobbi Klein. Every time it seems like Ballard and Bosch make any headway, someone on the inside ends up working against them. For instance, Ballard’s lieutenant is not at all pleased with Bosch’s presence. At one point, he claims to be angered enough at Ballard and her “dark hours” mode, which seldom involves following all procedures, that he temporarily suspends her.But not even a suspension will stop Ballard. She and Bosch discover that the guilty party may have been hiding in plain sight the entire time, and they may be putting themselves in greater danger the more they pursue the truth. THE DARK HOURS is an outstanding book for loyal readers of Connelly’s work and viewers of Amazon Prime’s sorely missed “Bosch” series.Reviewed by Ray Palen "
257,5.0,"Seriously. Michael Connelly is The Master! What other author could take on so many of today's relevant issues without managing to offend SOMEONE? Running in the background of the two primary crimes were the issues of COVID, vaccines, defunding of law enforcement, police brutality, protests, mass homelessness within LA, and the events of January 6th that took place at the Capitol building. Yet the author touched on these issues without trying to get the reader to lean one way or the other. The Dark Hours opens with Renée Ballard taking shelter beneath an overpass as thousands of revelers fire guns in the air in the “annual rain of lead.” Ballard is called to the scene of a shooting where it appears that an auto repair shop owner has been accidentally struck by a celebratory bullet in the middle of a crowded street party. And then there's the case of the serial rapists who are being referred to as The Midnight Men...I so love reading of the friendship shared between Ballard and Bosch. No matter what is going on they are there for each other!! Everyone needs a Bosch in their life.The Dark Hours is a fantastic book for both loyal and new readers of Michael Connelly. I'm definitely intrigued by the ending of the book and I can't wait to read the next in the series!!"
258,4.0,"Michael Connelly's latest, ""The Dark Hours,"" featuring Renee Ballard (the fourth book with her as lead protagonist) and Harry Bosch (the 6,382nd book with him as lead protagonist) is a sterling example of the clean efficiency of his prose. Once an LA Times Crime Beat writer, Connelly retains a seemingly facile ability to capture the telling detail, push the plot, and describe the drama with no wasted words. It's like the way McCartney or Lennon can crank out a pop tune with no wasted beats:""POW - Instant Karma's gonna get you, knock you right off your feet.""In ""The Dark Hours,"" Renee Ballard feels more fully fleshed out than she has in the past. Rather than sleeping rough in a tent on the beach, she has an apartment, and midway through the novel she picks up a dog (a chihuahua from the local shelter). Similarly, her relationship with Bosch (strictly professional) has more nuance; she looks to him more specifically as a mentor and certainly as an example, especially in the post-BLM and current pandemic environment which shows the LAPD turning into a force of clock-punchers, more reactive than proactive in their responses to crime, and more interested in protecting the reputation of the police department than in protecting the city's citizens. There are a couple of intertwined plots here, one regarding a pair of serial rapists known as the ""Midnight Men"" and the other about a homicide made to look like a suicide on New Year's Eve; the homicide is of a former gangbanger who has gone straight. If you've read and loved Connelly's books before, you will love this one. If you are new to the Harry Bosch Universe, you can start here, although I'd recommend you start at the beginning of the series."
259,2.0,"Another disappointing book. I’ve definitely decided I don’t like Renee - her personality and her tactics. And Harry didn’t “sound” like Harry in this book. I’ve been wondering if Connelly writes these books anymore. And it it him that’s gone WOKE or ghostwriter(s). Not sure if I can take anymore. I’ll keep reading the HB books but no more Renee. (view spoiler)[And if she ends up teaming with Harry, I won’t be reading his books anymore. 😕 (hide spoiler)]The murder mystery was sloppily “resolved.” I’m not sure we even know exactly what happened. The Midnight Men case was so bogus and the resolution was extremely unsatisfying. And to continue my rant, Renee lost a dog she never spent much time with and gets another dog she’s already not spending time with. You don’t rescue a dog from a shelter only to immediately have to put them in boarding. 😡 "
260,3.0,"I'm a fan of this author and the Renee Ballard books, so was excited that this one was coming out. Characterizations are strong and I appreciated the motivations and shades of grey depicted throughout much of the book. This novel contains the threat of sexual violence and also depicts sexual violence, which is a subject that I have trouble reading about. I don't think Connelly is particularly adroit at writing that aspect of this book. But much of the rest of it is up to his usual standard and I sincerely enjoyed it. I also ding this installment as the resolution of Ballard's story seemed particularly unrealistic. More a fantasy than the gritty ambiguity that I enjoy in my detective noir. The shades of grey turned into black and white in a way that left me wanting.Still, I'm along for this ride, and if you're reading this I'm guessing that you are too. But find myself hoping that the next installment is stronger. Thanks for reading this review."
261,2.0,"My what an apt title The Dark Hours indeed reading this horrible horse shit. A second swing and a miss by Connelly after Fair Warning--which was another apropo title since he told me and I still made the mistake of reading it. When old white authors go ""woke"" who you going to call? Ghost of good writers? Woke busters? I am being kind when I say this book is a pile of horse dung. The interior jacket misleads the reader into thinking this is a joint collaboration between Bosch and Ballard - it is not AT ALL. This is all Renee Ballard at her worst. Going full Don Quixote against the evil horrible white cops she is forced to work with and everyone else that does not appreciate all her woke efforts to right the wrongs of the L A P D. Bosch is completely emasculated in this book and does not even resemble a former shadow of the formidable character Connelly crafted over dozens of books and thirty years. He has to be driven to his death jab appointment by Ballard who flashes her badge and says this is my appointment. Total nonsense when again and again she rails against anyone else who abuses their position as a police officer. This is the end of a thirty year road for me with Connelly, rather unfortunate because when he was writing real crime fiction he was outstanding. This is total tripe, do yourself a favor and save your Andrew Jackson ($20). Fortunately I flipped this turd like a big mac on ebay."
262,4.0,"Detective Renee Ballard of LAPD's Hollywood Division catches a New Year's Eve murder that ties into an old case of (now retired) Detective Harry Bosch in this contemporary police procedural. And I *do* mean ""contemporary"": unlike pretty much every non-historical series work of fiction, this one takes place in a VERY specific time and place: the city of Los Angeles in January 2021. Yeah, this past January. Earlier this very year.The background is what we're living through RIGHT NOW: an ongoing pandemic, attitudes towards police changing, politics going mad -- yes, the January 6th attack on the Capitol happens in the background of this book -- and cops coping. Connelly is going out on a bit of a limb, because if he's misreading things then in a year or two things will look dated, but in his own little corner of the crime-fiction universe, Michael Connelly is trying to write history as it happens."
263,4.0,"Not enough Harry Bosch for me. And I don’t care to be reading about COVID. Like I’m living through it, don’t want to read about masks, vaccines etc. But I still love Michael Connelly. Just give me more Harry Bosch next time! "
264,5.0,"Another five star review for Mr. Connelly. The story starts as 2020 comes to a close with Rene Ballard working on a case with two serial rapist who tend to strike on holidays. While out on patrol New Years Eve, she is called to a strange death right after midnight. A business owner is dead shortly after numerous gunshots are fired in the air to celebrate the New Year. As she digs into this murder, she finds that gun that killed the business owner was connected to a cold case investigated by Harry Bosch back in the day. While this is billed as Renee Ballard and Harry Bosch novel, it is much more of a Rene Ballard novel with some appearances by Harry Bosch. It is told completely from her perspective, and most of the novel Harry is MIA. That would be the only negative I can find with this novel as you can never have enough Harry Bosch. While it was disappointing not to have Harry Bosch more involved, that didn’t take away from making this a great book. I didn’t want to put it down and finished it quickly. Both of the storylines, the serial rapists and the businessman murder, were well thought out and very interesting. They were unique and provided a lot of intensity and tension in the novel. I also thought it was good to see a novel incorporate all the chaos of the last few years of real life. A novel about the police today is very different than before the events of the past few years. The dynamics are so different and it leads to a lot of interesting situations. I also like that Mr. Connelly acknowledges Covid. I feel like too many books pretend it never happened. Again it is interesting to see how it changes some things in police work. Overall a great novel worth your time whether you are a long time fan of Michael Connelly or new to his work. "
265,5.0,"Ballard calls on Bosch for back-up on two cases that she is working simultaneously in the week after New Year's 2020 — the ""accidental"" death of a former gang member who has managed to leave ""the life"" and now runs an auto repair business; and a series of home invasion / rapes my two men that have earned the nickname The Midnight Men. An interesting look at life in the LAPD during the pandemic and in the wake of the political realities in the wake of the killing George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter protests.Another Connelly page-turner.This was book #51 on our 2021 Read-alouds List and book #28 on our 2021 Read-alouds with Lutrecia List."
266,3.0,I found Renee super annoying in this one and the ending stretched my belief ability. 
267,1.0,Couldn’t get past chapter 2 with language and political nonsense. I was so looking forward to this book. 
268,5.0,Renee Ballard is a total badass! Really liked this new one.
269,4.0,Got a bunch of credits for delaying my prime deliveries so I got to pick this up. Renee is great but Harry is even better and their cross overs are awesome. Can't wait to see what happens next - as always!
270,4.0,"Picked this up yesterday and finished it late last night! Loved every page, could not put it down; sleep be damned! Definitely the best installment of this part of the Bosch universe (the Renee/Harry mashup) and quite possibly one of the best of the entire series overall (I’m still rereading the whole series in chronological order, but am currently only up to #10). Fantastic crime drama, great characters, believable storylines, topical references, serious subjects. Nobody writes police procedurals better than MC. I am already looking forward to the next installment!Four (well deserved) stars.*And I reached my GoodReads 2021 goal! Woohoo! "
271,4.0,"I am really enjoying Ballard, as Bosch is being phased out. I think. It was interesting to read about the police department in LA during the pandemic. I assume it’s based on truth."
272,5.0,"My thanks to Orion Publishing Group for an eARC via NetGalley of ‘The Dark Hours’ by Michael Connelly in exchange for an honest review. This is Book 4 in the Renée Ballard series combined with Book 23 of his long running Harry Bosch series. I have read the first two police procedurals featuring Ballard and Bosch and rated both 5 stars. While I seem to have missed Ballard Book 3, each book works fine as a standalone as sufficient background is provided. On New Years Eve, in a USA tradition that gives me the heebie-jeebies, revellers shoot their guns into the air at midnight. Of course, inevitably this leads to a rain of lead. In the middle of a street party a man is shot dead. It seems at first a tragic accident until Detective Renée Ballard connects the bullet to an unsolved cold case last worked by legendary ex-LAPD detective Harry Bosch. They again team up to investigate. In addition, Ballard is working a case involving a pair of violent predators, dubbed the Midnight Men, who stalk the city during the dark hours. Again, Connelly is a crime writer who I have found is consistent in his plotting and characterisations. Once started I find them almost impossible to set down. Alongside these complex cases Connelly integrates current events impacting on the LAPD police department including the pandemic, the George Floyd and BLM protests, and the events of January 6th.A novel and series that I highly recommended for readers who enjoy USA based crime fiction. "
273,3.0,"The main story line was ""police who don't get their own way are whiney babies"" which may be factually accurate but is fairly dull to read."
274,5.0,"Connelly remains the gold standard in this genre. Bosch and Ballard are kindred spirits that pair nicely. The issues of the day are integrated into a very readable, well paced, mystery. My hope is that the suits at Amazon will invite Ballard to paddle into the stream with Harry and Maddie."
275,4.0,"Even though no one could accomplish in 48 hrs what Ballard did, I still really liked the book. It will be interesting to see what happens in the next in this series."
276,4.0,"Living abroad, I am not always directly informed of what's happening in US, or what the current climate is; nor could I have ever imagined the level of distrust, in the police and in law enforcement as described here in The Dark Hours. Well of course, I am quite aware that discrimination and bias are on the rise in the US; and that a certain sense of humanity and solidarity is slowly vanishing in this great country. Still, to actually read that good police are thinking of quitting their job because of this climate. How even these good policewomen & policemen are being treated by the very people they are willing to protect, it's heartbreaking.I thought The Dark Hours was a very good read, not outstanding, not unforgettable, but simply solid and captivating and certainly wanting to convey the sentiment of the times. I am, and will always be a fan of Michael Connelly's books, and of Harry Bosch, in particular. I can't wait for the next chapter in Ballard's career. From the last pages in the book, it looks like Ballard might be having the upper hand, and who knows what she will choose? "
277,4.0,"Another page turner, great characters & story, as usual. "
278,4.0,"Ballard and Bosch, what's not to like!"
279,4.0,The Dark Hours was another enjoyable Harry Bosch/Renee Ballard novel. Michael Connelly has written a novel that takes during the current pandemic and I must admit I found it off-putting at first. But this is a good entry in the series so I did not find it off-putting for long. 
280,5.0,"4.75 stars, what a page turner, really hard to put this book down. Excellent. "
281,5.0,"What a great read. Michael Connelly hits another home run here, I could almost see it playing out as I read the book. I can’t wait to read the next installment. "
282,5.0,"I eagerly await each new Connelly book! This one was really good. Renee Ballard is an intriguing, interesting, and strong female lead. I want to know what she’ll do next!"
283,5.0,Yet another cracker from Michael ConnellyI’m really enjoying the pairing of Ballard and Bosch. It has totally rejuvenated the Harry Bosch series.Next one please! 
284,5.0,"Ballard and Bosch take on a nightmare of serial rapes to their well-planned and horrific source against a background of working-to-make-the-police-do-better--dealing with dismal colleagues and lots of bad guys, yes, guys: white guys, rich guys, gang guys, gross guys. Coloring outside the lines as these two do best, a long-unsolved murder gets connected to a new one, a group of greedy dentists wreak mayhem, a rape ring is smashed, and the world is righted for a moment. A new dog for Ballard brings warmth into the story, the relentless work to do the right thing inspires, and the pace is fast page-turner speed. Super read1"
285,5.0,Another great read.
286,5.0,"Excellent, as usual. Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series maintains a very high standard, while transitioning to a new lead character and hinting at future directions. This edition is both very much of-the-moment, with threads about the challenges of policing in the post-pandemic world, as well as in keeping with the classic ""everyone matters or no one matters"" Bosch ethos readers know and love. The mystery here was clever and engaging, the character interactions and dialog crisp and smooth. Just great work, once again."
287,5.0,Bosch and Ballard team up again on two cases. Love the ending of this one. 5/5 stars.
288,4.0,"Connelly sets this amidst a backdrop of Covid, a lack of community confidence in the police and subsequent funding. Morale in the police service has waned and it seems many are just going through the motions. But not Ballard of course, though even she wavers here... wondering if it's worth all of the internal battles she needs to fight to work with the system.Ballard is front and centre here and I liked that Connelly is progressing her story arc and developing her character. She's moved from her tent on the beach to a unit and there's a smidge of romance on offer. He also balances Bosch's involvement well and he's always got insight and ideas but more of a support than taking the reins himself.This is a really enjoyable book and appreciated that there was no attempt to bring the two cases together in any way; rather we're offered two separate mysteries. I also liked the twist Connelly gives us with the rape investigation which is something a little different.Read my review here: https://www.debbish.com/books-literat..."
289,5.0,Telling.
290,5.0,"Michael Connelly has captured the pandemic and resulting chaos perfectly in this book. Detective Rachel Ballard gets a shooting on New Year’s Eve. Every officer is on duty as 2021 comes in. While working the shooting, Ballard has to continue her work on a rape case that involves two women. When a third victim is attacked, Ballard is overwhelmed by the case, the attitudes of fellow officers, and a country divided in a horrific way. Compelling story, fascinating police procedures, and help from Bosch make this another great book. I’m already eager for the next one. "
291,4.0,"Waiting for months for this book paid off. Another excellent instalment!Renee and Harry make a great team, they are the ideal partners, they are there for each other no question asked, complete and unquestionable trust. They are both laser focused on the job and sharp as can be. A real delight to read this book, despite the hard topic addressed (rape and everything else).I am so so so looking forward to Michael Connelly's next book!"
292,4.0,"More Ballard than Bosch in a straight ahead LA police procedural. Less angst and attitude than in the Bosch stand alones. It’s set in the winter of 2020/21 and does a good job dealing with the pandemic, masking, vax etc. Two cases: the random murder of an ex gangbanger connects with an old unsolved case worked by Bosch; and serial rapists who may or may not be targeting their victims. Also a backstory about politics, sloth and timeserving in the police. Oh yeah, and sexual harassment. Ballard has some career choices to make as she bucks bureaucratic inertia. Don’t think the LAPD bosses would like Connelly…."
293,4.0,I was super excited to get this book from the library the week it was published. It was very good. The story was quick paced and I enjoyed the twist and turns. I also like how the story weaves Ballard and Bosch together. I definitely recommend this to fans of the series. 4.5/5
294,5.0,"I’ve been in a bit of a reading funk, but this one grabbed me by the throat and didn’t let go. Classic Connelly."
295,5.0,"I didn’t want to like this audiobook. I want a BOSCH book!!! Not a Renee Ballard story!! So it’s two stories/cases in one. A gang member turned respectable business owner is murdered. Tag team serial rapists are on the loose. I loved it! See above for possible TW! This isn’t the 1st Bosch book so if you’ve read others, you know what you’re in for! Took off 1/2 STAR cuz she’s no Bosch! Titus Welliver had brief cameos but only helps Ballard.BOSCH FAN!"
296,5.0,"Publication date: November 9, 2021Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read and review an advanced reader's copy of this book. This in no way affects my review, all opinions are my own.From the publisher, as I do not repeat the contents or story of books in reviews, I let them do it as they do it better than I do 😸.Has a killer lain dormant for years only to strike again on New Year’s Eve? LAPD Detective Renée Ballard and Harry Bosch team up to find justice for an innocent victim in the new thriller from #1 New York Times bestselling author Michael ConnellyThere's chaos in Hollywood on New Year's Eve. Working her graveyard shift, LAPD Detective Renée Ballard seeks shelter at the end of the countdown to wait out the traditional rain of lead as hundreds of revellers shoot their guns into the air. As reports start to roll in of shattered windshields and other damage, Ballard is called to a scene where a hardworking auto shop owner has been fatally hit by a bullet in the middle of a crowded street party.It doesn't take long for Ballard to determine that the deadly bullet could not have fallen from the sky. Ballard’s investigation leads her to look into another unsolved murder—a case at one time worked by Detective Harry Bosch.Ballard and Bosch team up once again to find out where the old and new cases intersect. All the while they must look over their shoulders. The killer who has stayed undetected for so long knows they are coming after him.Harry Bosch is one of my favourite characters in fiction ever ... and I loved the show as well... Welliver. (lol) Renee Ballard did not appear on the show in case this is the first book you pick up after being peeved that that series was not renewed but she is a beloved character in this book universe. It is an excellent addition to the Bosch Universe of books and if you have not read any of them,... well pick them up and read some or all of them. (I reread the entire series this year!) The story is compelling and well written and at no time do you say ""no way"" to some junky police science or unbelievable plotline. What an excellent addition to the series and I look forward to the next one(s) as well. As always, I try to find a reason to not rate with stars as I simply adore emojis (outside of their incessant use by ""🙏-ed Social Influencer Millennials/#BachelorNation survivors/Tik-Tok and YouTube Millionaires/snowflakes / literally-like-overusers etc. "") on Instagram and Twitter... Get a real job, people!) so let's give it 👮‍♂️👮‍♂️👮‍♂️👮‍♂️👮‍♂️"
297,4.0,"I’m liking the Bosch/Ballard partnership more and more. In this novel, Renee Ballard is juggling a couple of different cases on the graveyard shift that could be more than the gang shooting and rape that they seem. She pulls in Bosch when she needs help and begins to feel alienated from her colleagues on the force."
298,5.0,"For me Michael Connelly never puts a foot wrong. His books are plot driven, have great characters and are well written. This is as good as always. It is very topical, written and set during the Pandemic (and including the storming of the Senate). It shows how the police have been defunded, the lack of morale, with the public losing confidence making it harder on those battling for justice.Rene Ballard is coming into her own, but it’s good to have Bosch partnering her unofficially and being her backup. This book combines a new murder with one of Bosch’s cold cases, a good reason for him to be involved, and multiple rapes to solve as well - so plenty going on. I enjoyed every page of it. Definitely 5 stars.Thanks to Orion Publishing and NetGalley for a much wanted ARC."
299,5.0,"Gritty, dark and corrupt, LA is in the midst of Covid, police defunding, Black Lives Matter Protests, and severe image problems for law enforcement agencies. Morale is low, and many cops are just keeping their heads down. Detective Ballard, recently reassigned from homicide to sex crimes, has been called to a shooting on New Years Eve. She’s hoping this will be the ticket back to a permanent homicide posting. .Through a ballistics match to an old unsolved case, Ballard is reconnected with retired Detective Inspector Harry Bosch.. They soon realize they’ll have to proceed carefully on this case, as it’s pretty certain there is a dirty cop involved.Ballard is also involved in solving a series of particularly vicious rapes, Very well written, the pace is fast and furious. The pairing of Bosch and Ballard works well, as they go about their jobs in a unorthodox manner, Highly recommend.Thank you to netgalley and the publisher for this advance copy, I really appreciate the opportunity to read this latest novel."
300,5.0,"It never ceases to amaze me how Michael Connelly manages to keep up his incredibly high stand in the Bosch and Ballard novels. This latest entry is more Ballard than Bosch, with the latter providing support from the sidelines. In this compulsive read Renee goes on the hunt for tag-team rapists, whilst has problems at work, another story angel links to one of Bosch's cold cases. As usual, Connelly's masterful flair brings the many story strands together and whilst Bosch might be nearing the end of the line, Renee Ballard has some ways to go as you will find out with the killer ending! Maybe Maddie Bosch will appear on team in the next book! I love this series. "
301,5.0,"There is no question when the latest Michael Connelly book, The Dark Hours, was written. Detective Renée Ballard is facing all of the problems of covid-19 and George Floyd America. The riots have used up much of the budget of the LA police department so there is a hiring freeze. The public trust in police is at an all time low. The police have become reactive instead of pro-active in response. And the pandemic places everyone at risk. On top of this, Ballard faces sexism and attitude from her co-workers and bosses. Luckily she is an excellent detective and has Harry Bosch as her sidekick. The two major crimes are horrifying and when Ballard is attacked, we wondered which crime is responsible. The ending is a cliff-hanger for Renee, though not for her cases. There is also a line said by Bosch that foretells how Connelly sees his writing career going (IMHO.) Thank you to Edelweiss and Little Brown for the pre-pub edition of this book."
302,5.0,This is the first book that I have read by Michael Connelly. I have watched the Bosch series on Amazon so I knew the characters. I loved it!!! I can’t wait to go back and read the other Renee Ballard books. She is awesome!!!! This book is the first book to tackle Covid and Black Lives Matter. I thought the author did a fantastic job capturing that time period. I received this ARC for an honest opinion. #novelsuspectsinsiders
303,5.0,I have known for sometime that Connelly was going to put Bosch out to pasture. While I don't think it will be soon it is clear that Ballard will be one of the characters to take up his place.... I suspect Maddie will enter the fray soon also. I really enjoyed this book and like that he didn't run from the current strife happening in police departments. I look forward to the next book.
304,5.0,"The best ! Connelly maintains his excellent story telling with #4 in the Renee Ballard series. Renee goes all out to solve a serial rapist case while solving a murder of an ex-gang member, plus , uncovering a dirty cop."
305,4.0,"“Ballard would be left alone in the dark hours. It was exactly what she wanted.”Don’t talk to Detective Renee Ballard about doing anything but the Midnight shift, where she could mostly work alone and have less bureaucracy to get in the way of doing her job. At one point in THE DARK HOURS, the latest novel from Michael Connelly, Renee’s Lt. tries to reward her with a transfer to the day shift. She promptly rebukes that letting him know she is perfectly happy staying on the dark side and would prefer simple praise for a job well done to anyone messing with her schedule.This is the fourth time Connelly has featured Detective Renee Ballard in a novel and the third time he has also included newly retired LAPD Detective Harry Bosch. Bosch is now an enigma, with both a hit streaming series that just wrapped up on Amazon Prime as well as being the most featured character all-time in Connelly’s novels. He can also quickly become a distraction as a character so powerful he demands nearly all your attention when he is on the page. For that reason, Connelly has clearly moved him to a secondary role in THE DARK HOURS --- this novel belongs to Renee Ballard.There is perhaps no author working today who writes a police procedural quite like Michel Connelly. His language is just gritty enough to provide the right amount of credibility needed for readers to believe they are listening to actual discussions that might take place both on the street and back at the squad room. He is also a master of dialogue who infuses his characters with enough straight talk, taken perhaps from his years as a reporter, that it instantly creates three-dimensional, realistic characters on the page.THE DARK HOURS, however, is a different animal from anything Connelly has previously written. The Pandemic, which unfortunately still exists in our world, posed a great quandary to writers. Do they deal with the elephant in the room and write about it in their fiction or completely ignore it giving their readers a fictional world where they can escape from the day-to-day worries about COVID-19? Connelly has chosen the former and it plays well. We get to see a police force that is barely respected by the public who take instant disdain for them and have no issue talking back and down to the boys in blue. From an internal standpoint, we witness a mix of PTSD and lack of enthusiasm from the squad itself --- whether it be Hollywood Homicide or LAPD --- and this makes the matter of expecting assistance from your colleagues yet another river to cross.The action begins on New Year’s Eve, a night where all law enforcement is already on guard for problems all over the map. Ballard believes that what goes up must come down which means that every new year in the City Of Angels began with risk. Her last or first assignment of the year, depending on when exactly the DOA was killed, involves the murder of a hard-working auto mechanic named Javier Raff who is a local business owner. He died with his uniform on, making identification that much easier as you can clearly see the Javier patch on his oil-stained mechanic jumper. Ballard also finds instant evidence of Javier’s affiliation with local street gang, Los Palmas, making him a target for death at any time.There happen to be a bunch of homicides on or about the same time which may or may not be related. There was an elderly couple robbed and set on fire in West Hollywood. There were also a couple of home break-ins that involved rape. This makes Ballard and everyone in her department think about the Midnight Men, perps that were never caught who had been responsible for robbery, rape, and alleged murder charges. One of the cases Ballard calls up in her investigation involves an open cold case from a now retired LAPD Detective who she already has a working relationship with --- Harry Bosch.The bullet found at one of Ballard’s murder sites matches one found at a case ten years earlier up in the Valley. The bullets definitely came from the same gun as the one that killed the previous victim, an Albert Lee. She contacts Bosch who is more than eager to help out as he takes any Open Cold Cases as a personal affront and is glad to finally have another chance at nailing the perp involved. As he assists Ballard in her current cases, they spend time following up with the home break-in/rape victims to see what common threads they can put together. This will involve going back to the first known victim of the Midnight Men, a woman called Bobbi Klein.One big clue that Ballard turns up is the fact that the Midnight Men cut the wires to the street lamps outside the last two homes that were broken into. Every time it seems like Ballard or Ballard and Bosch together make any headway, someone internal ends up working against them. For instance, Ballard’s Lt. is not at all pleased at the involvement of Bosch and at one-point claims to be angered enough at Ballard and her ‘dark hours’ mode which seldom involves following all procedures, to temporarily suspend her.Even suspension will not stop Ballard and Bosch is already retired and not subject to the decisions of LAPD or Hollywood Homicide management. What they will discover is that their killer or killers may have been hiding in plain sight the entire time since the original case of Bosch’s and that they may be putting themselves in danger the more they pursue things. THE DARK HOURS is a great read for both those loyal readers of Michael Connelly as well as viewers of the now cancelled Bosch streaming show that is sorely missed!Reviewed by Ray Palen for Book Reporter"
306,5.0,"SUBJECTIVE READER REVIEW WITH PLOT SPOILERS FOLLOWS: First of all, Michael Connelly gives us East Coast dwellers our first intimate look at what Los Angeles has become following the pandemic and Floyd Riots of the past year. I had no idea that every overpass in the city serves as a hub of homeless encampments. The woke crowd has cowed the LAPD into a purely responsive organization, too afraid to actively police neighborhoods should the looters and rioters take umbrage. What he describes through the eyes of Renee Ballard is almost a post-Apocalyptical horror story. Jesus, glad I'm no where near there! Continuing the education of Kavanagh, Connelly further advises of the annual New Year's Eve phenomenon known as the 'rain of lead.' At the stroke of midnight, apparently every citizen who owns a firearm discharges it into the air! And that's where the book starts, with Renee and her reluctant partner Lisa Moore parked under the Cahuenga Overpass for its protection against the bullets raining back down on earth. Then they get the call to a murder nearby and the death of former Las Palmas gang member Javier Raffa whose been straight for 15 years. Pulling the strings on Raffa reveal some incredible things that groups of dentists are doing as investment portfolios! Of course Raffa is killed during the rain of lead, so no one heard a thing. Turns out it cost Javy Raffa $25,000 to buy his way out of Las Palmas, but who's got 25 large lying around, right? So this association of dentists we'll call Crown Labs, Inc, loans out money via their street banker Chris Bonner, and the loan is secured via joint ownership of Raffa's auto repair property. Seems as though Bonner saw the plot as more profitably useful, but he uses a .22 caliber handgun and fails to grab the shell casing as it flew under a vehicle. Of course the CSI team finds it and tags it to a murder ten years hence. Of course the head detective on the cold case murder is Harry Bosch, so he and Renee team up once again to piss off the entire LAPD. Interestingly, they discover the Murder Book Bosch had assembled on the old Albert Lee murder is missing from archives so they get downright sneaky. Casing Raffa's funeral they ID Raffa's partner Dentist Dennis Hoyle, brace him up with some uncomfortable questions and the next thing you know Renee wakes in her own bed with a man straddling her body holding a gun in her mouth. His weight is on her chest so she uses her trunk and legs to knock him off, takes a couple of hard hits before shooting him with his own gun. Ballard recognizes him as her predecessor on the Late Show, Detective Christopher Bonner, Retired. The subsequent search of his car reveals the .22 caliber pistol used in both homicides. Then the retributions begin in earnest. Before her prickhead boss can pull her off of active duty she gets a call about a home invasion. Turns out Cindy Carpenter was attacked in her own home by two men who disabled her then repeatedly raped her before leaving. She refuses to even consider her ex as possibly involved, but the fact that the streetlight right outside her house was out due to willful disabling. As Ballard gets smarter on the Midnight Men case, the LAPD circles the wagons due to the involvement of their own in crimes and puts Ballard on the bench. In the meantime she's mad pals with the street light guy, Carl Shaeffer, who calls her the next day about a just-called-in light outage. He agrees to not send out a repair crew, allowing Ballard to sniff around herself. I think we've all read novels that include involvement in the Dark Web, but the Midnight Men actually had a difficult to reach site called 'Teach Her A Lesson.' If you wanna hear about how Ballard and Bosch solve this one you gotta get the book and read it. One little clue: Ballard's ingenuous solving of the case after she resigns then turns over all evidence to the FBI brings about a sea change at the Police Administration Building!"
307,5.0,"This is the kind of book that you can't use to introduce a character. However, if this had been the first Renee Ballard story, I'd have liked her better from the beginning. I'm rating this a ""qualified"" five stars. I looked at my rating for the other Renee books, and seeing where I'd rated them, and liking this one best, I had to grant the last star. It may not be a perfect book, but I really enjoyed it.It's kind of overselling this to call this book a Renee Ballard and Harry Bosch story. Harry is here, but this is Renee's book. None of it is written from Harry's point-of-view. He's a character in this story. He's here; he's important and helpful, but this is Renee's plot.On New Year's Eve 2020, Renee is on duty, working with a Detective from the ""Crimes Against People (CAP)"" desk. There's a pair of rapists active in the Hollywood Division who seem to strike only on Holidays...Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve, so far. As an attempt is expected, Ballard and her assigned partner for the case are watching the area. That's plot point one.While they're waiting, Renee gets a regular night shift call for a shooting victim. In Los Angeles, there are cases every year on New Year's Eve of people being wounded or even killed by accidental shootings. People fire guns in the air at midnight with such regularity that falling bullets are a real hazard. In a Hispanic community, a gathering has happened and a man is dead. The trouble is that someone has used the cover of the midnight gunfire to murder him. Happy 2021!Renee, being who she has been over the other books, works hard on both cases and tries hard to hold on to the Homicide. Given the holiday, she knows she'll be able to work it a bit longer before it's transferred to West District homicide detectives. She finds a link to an old, open homicide case that Harry had been the investigating detective on. When she finds the file missing, she goes to the source and we're off to the races.As with all Connelly, the plot is thought out. As is typical of the Bosch books, in particular, this one has fewer gaps in the plotting filled in by happenstance. Both of the cases are interesting, and the working of the rape case gives a nice respite to the details of the homicide. The cases are well-balanced in the plot and the working of them makes sense. Both come to conclusions that are good enough, but the ending of the rape case I thought we were heading to would have been more horrible than the eventual end, which is bad enough, but mine would have caused more waves into coming stories.Ballard is in a weird place in this one. She's no longer ""transient homeless"" living on the beach in a tent or at her grandmother's home. The pandemic has forced her to get a place of her own, a rented condo in a community with a slightly overbearing homeowner's association president. Her dog, Lola, has died and she gets a new dog in the course of this book. She's also re-evaluating the way the LAPD works, during the book, and realizes that she doesn't know if she's willing to continue in the PD as it is. So, she has a lot going on. As a result, Tim thinks, she does some things that are less than fully considered and planned during the rape investigation. This buys her some big trouble that she seems to have worked out in the end only because she resolved the case well.All in all, this is good story, and a good entry in the series."
308,5.0,"As usual, Michael Connelly gives us an interesting, well-written, and entertaining book. One of the things I like most about this series (and the Bosch series from which it came) is that the books appear to be so well-researched. I said ""appears"" because I am not certain that officers and detectives act as described in the book--but I don't care! The books are so well-written that I believe they act as described. That might be the mark of the perfect true-life storyteller. In this book, Renee Ballard, who has been assigned to night duty as punishment for a sexual harassment claim and has come to love the assignment, is working on two cases: the murder of a former gang member and the assault and rape of what appears to be random women. In this series, Renee typically becomes involved in the cases she first investigates as the ""night duty"" detective, but the cases are then turned over to other divisions--e.g., murders to the homicide division, sex crimes to the sex crimes division, etc. As the first detective at the scene, she observes, reports, and hands the crime off. When the crime she investigates grabs her attention for one reason or another and she does not want to hand it off. In the Ballard series, she typically finds ways to keep the case. Her cases also typically involve getting her friend Harry Bosch involved in the case. Harry is a retired detective who occasionally does ""cold case"" work but is always ready and willing to assist Renee, who works alone, with any cases she has. As Renee attempts to solve the murder of the former gang member and the rapes of the random women, she struggles with the ideology of the ""new"" 2021 police department--where she believes the administrators are more concerned with image than with protecting citizens and where much of the funding necessary to protect citizens has been diverted to controlling protests. This is a typical Connelly book. There are plenty of clues--but that is because the characters speak their thoughts, letting you know how their thought patterns lead to the conclusions that help them solve the cases. I suspend belief during some of the exchanges as it appears that the detectives Ballard and Bosch are much more intelligent than the rest of us humans. But, still, it is interesting because it could be true--everything in the book is written to make it possible for a reasonably intelligent and observant human to come to the same conclusions. That is what makes Connelly's books so appealing. Another aspect of the book(s) that make(s) it(them) compelling to me is the fact that we are getting to know Renee Ballard slowly, but very well. In the first books in the series, she slept on the beach every night with her beloved dog Lola. Now she has an apartment, her dog has passed, she may be interested in pursuing a romantic relationship, and she explores the idea of getting another four-legged companion. In other words, Renee has grown as the series has grown. I will buy the next book and will be as involved in Renee's growth as in the cases she solves.Meanwhile, Harry is exactly what he has always been--a fine human who always seems to do the right thing. And a man who is lonely and longs for a good relationship with one particular person--his daughter. He is a good, loyal friend to those who understand what makes a person who has a conscious tick and an enemy to those who do not. Of course, I should mention that the writing is impeccable. Sometimes, the short, choppy descriptions seem to stand our more than I want them to--on the other hand, that is how we humans would describe things in our own heads. The pacing is excellent. The stories are well plotted and believable. All in all, an excellent book. The entire series is excellent--as is the Bosch series."
309,5.0,"Michael Connelly is one of a few writers I read in this genre, one whose work I buy in hardcover on pre-order. Some books feel phoned, Lee Child I'm looking at you, but Michael never does that. This is an intricately plotted, wonderfully written mystery that leaves nothing out.Renee Ballard is my favorite Connelly character, though I've read all of his others, and like Harry, Renee is tops in my estimation. The Dark Hours leaves nothing unexplored. It touches on all the issues of the current times BLM, Defund the Police (with a detailed explanation of how that misguided phrase (it really should be reform) affects police departments across the nation), Covid-19, misogyny within the police force which is still rampant. It captures the tone and tenor of the nation perfectly including the attempted insurrection on 1/6/21.Many police officers are feeling very under appreciated, some have decided on a reactive only form of policing because the public is so hostile to them, rather than proactive which is absolutely necessary for effective police work. Renee is one who remains committed to proactive policing and she has a work ethic that would be the envy of any supervisor in any profession were it not for the fact there are villains everywhere here, including her various bosses, colleagues and criminals. The only person she can actually count on is the retired Harry Bosch who shares her values and commitment. Renee begins the book under a freeway on New Year's Eve to be protected from LA tradition of idiots firing weapons into the air at midnight and the consequent hail of bullets returning to ground. She catches not one but two new cases, though one she had been working on for a bit, a two man team of brutal rapists, unusual as that is, then a murder that she desperately wants to hang onto rather than turning it over to homicide. Her investigations lead her in many directions, as mentioned she is tireless in her devotion to her job, working many unpaid hours on her own time on both cases. Her ""partner"" has decided to take the holiday weekend off which leaves Renee on her own completely. As she works her cases, she discovers that one of them is tied to an old unsolved case that Harry worked years earlier, so she makes contact with him hoping he has the murder book, which is missing from storage. They work together to solve that case with outstanding police work. Her other case she discovers has been ""profiled"" wrongly in how the victims are chosen, she finds another angle entirely and works that very hard as well.For her troubles she ends up in trouble with her boss, his boss and it seems the entire LAPD. She ends up solving both cases, essentially on her own. She's been considering whether to leave the department entirely given the cutbacks, lack of resources and support. She decides to do and just before solving the Midnight Men rape case resigns from the department. She and Harry plan to team up although how that will result in an income stream for her is unclear and she's not near her 20 year pension yet. However, her excellent work and solving those last two cases bring her to the attention of the police chief who shows up at her home near the end of the book with what is essentially an open offer to the job of her choosing in the department. What that might be, a promotion, something else is never made clear apart from him telling her that the department needs officers like her, that it needs to change from within and that her job would be whatever she wanted it to be. She asks for time to think about, Harry has told her many times that organizations only change from within, but she thinks about their proposed partnership and asks the chief for time to think about it. He agrees to that but asks her to decide quickly and says he will hold her old badge until she does.The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it ended. It is one of those you love reading, but hate coming to the end because it is just THAT good. Michael Connelly is still very much at the top of his game. "
310,5.0,"I’ve read all but a few of Connelly’s mysteries, and I just scarfed down the newest, The Dark Hours, the fourth in the Renée Ballard series. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed all four, but was disappointed that Connelly pulled Bosch into the series after the first installment, The Late Show, the first installment. I felt that it diminished Ballard’s ability to stand on her own as a character, and that Connelly was trying to satisfy Bosch fans who would be unhappy with Bosch just riding off into the sunset.In the new book, the show definitely belongs to Ballard, even as the cover touts the book as “A Renée Ballard and Harry Bosch Novel.” Bosch plays a significant but backup role. He makes contributions, but mostly functions as Ballard’s partner, the way various characters have functioned as Bosch’s partners in past.Like many of the Connelly novels, The Dark Hours involves concurrent investigation of two crimes. One is a series of rapes by a pair of bad guys whom the cops refer to as the “Midnight Men.” Their M.O. is to break into their victim’s house while she’s asleep. Ballard must work with the Sexual Assault Unit on this case, specifically with Lisa Moore, one of the L.A.P.D. officers who are seriously demoralized by the attacks on the police department. Moore lacks the requisite enthusiasm for the investigation, leaving Ballard largely on her own.The other crime involves a murder that occurs at a New Year’s Eve celebration within minutes of the start of the 2021. The victim, who bought his way out a major gang years earlier, dies of a bullet to the head, a bullet that was clearly intended to be masked by the discharge of shots welcoming the new year. The bullet casing links the murder to a cold case that Bosch had investigated years earlier. When Ballard learns that the murder book for that case is missing, she goes to Bosch, who doesn’t have it. They link up to work together as Ballard struggles to hang onto the case, which she is supposed to turn over to the Homicide detectives.With her stubbornness and maverick style, Ballard has appropriately inherited Bosch’s mantle. In the end she disobeys orders and gets herself put on suspension. This, however, does not stop her work on the two cases.Of all the Bosch novels, this one most directly ties in with current events, in particular, the impact of the January 6 U.S. Capitol Insurrection on the L.A.P.D. and the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic on life in L.A. and on the P.D., and the “Black Lives Matter” movement.Changes in Ballard’s personal situation add progression to the series. With the beaches closed due to Covid, she has taken an apartment. Her dog, Lola, a pit bull mix, has died of bone cancer, and she finds a new rescue dog, Pinto, a Chihuahua mix small enough to be acceptable in the apartment. And when a fleeing bad guy knocks her down a stairway and she bangs her head, leading to a mild concussion, the EMT who assists her, Gerrit Single, follows up socially, marking the beginning of a possible romance."

Next. 14% - Bosch is here and gone so I'm back on break. 37% - This is slow and starting to feel like a remix of The Wrong Side of Goodbye. Bosch's name shouldn't be on this book. 57% - This is lazy compared to previous works.Do you remember a certain aviation thriller starring Steven Seagal where he dies in the first 15 minutes and Kurt Russell is the hero but Steven was coming off of Under Siege so his name sold tickets? Well this is exactly what is going on here. I first got into Michael Connelly because I read a Mickey Haller book, The Lincoln Lawyer, after reading more I read a few Haller books that featured Harry Bosch, and after Nine Dragons I decided to start at the beginning. Out 36 Michael Connelly Universe books only 4 of them have co-stars, 22 of 36 books, and 1 out the 4 co-starred books have supporting characters. Of the 4 books with 2 stars one is a Terry McCaleb Harry Bosch duo and the other 3 are Harry Bosch Renée Ballard duos. See the trend? Harry Bosch and Mickey Haller have worked together on several of each others books and never shared billing. Yet Renée Ballard shares billing with Harry Bosch on 3 out of her 4 books. I don't mind Renée and Harry working together or sharing a book. I do mind when Harry's name is on the book but he had more time as a supporting character in other books than he does as a co-star on a book that has his name on it. Harry was all over The Law of Innocence but his name wasn't on the book. Harry's name is here to get you to read the book. This is not a Bosch Ballard book like the last 2 books, this is a Ballard book that features Bosch. Harry doesn't show up til chapter 8 and he is gone before the chapter is over, you have to wait til chapter 15 for him to show up again and he's in and out.Just like The Late Show this book is slow and missing some layers. I think it got rolling around 60% into the book. The last half saved it action wise, but a lot of stupid decisions were made just like every other Ballard book I've read. Connelly most definitely reused some storylines. Connelly has had minor issues with continuity in the past, but I was offended that Harry was unfamiliar with the dark web, when I know he was exposed to it on previous cases and had it fully explained it to him. Please to not turn that brilliant man into a babe to make Ballard look needed. I read Angels Flight and this isn't going to fly with me. Overall it got the job done, in the end it fell short from the 5 stars I was expecting. It took me 3 days to read this book which is not normal for a Connelly, usually I can't put them down. I had to push through this one.Recommend to others?: Sure. I'm not jumping up and down over this one but it's above average compared to other books out there, yet it's not great for a Connelly."
312,5.0,"Renée Ballard is a tough-talking, rule-breaking, and determined cop who repeatedly gets in trouble with her bosses. Because she dared to file a complaint against a higher-up who harassed her, the brass transferred her to the night shift in the LAPD. What was meant to be a punishment, ironically, turned out to be a blessing. Working during ""The Dark Hours,"" the title of the latest police procedural from Michael Connelly, provides Renée with greater flexibility and independence. In this book, she becomes embroiled in two challenging cases. One involves the shooting death of a man during a New Year's Eve celebration. In addition, she is trying to track down a pair of serial predators who have been invading women's homes and brutalizing their victims. Connelly's timely themes include the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, the fury that some members of the public feel towards the police, and the exploitation of vulnerable females by sadistic assailants. Although Connelly's iconic character, Harry Bosch, is on hand to give Ballard much-appreciated assistance and support, Renée takes center stage. She steps on the toes of important people, is warned repeatedly by her supervisors to toe the line, and then proceeds to ignore their orders in her eagerness to make sure that justice is served. Michael Connelly brilliant depicts the geography and ambience of Los Angeles. He contrasts the homeless people sleeping rough beneath overpasses with the upper classes who live lavishly in upscale neighborhoods. The jargon-filled dialogue is crisp, gritty, and authentic, and the action scenes are exciting and intense. Renée is not only trained to defend herself, but she is also smart and insightful. In fact, she is very much like a young Harry Bosch. What she cannot stand is teaming up with colleagues who are lazy, mean-spirited, and corrupt, and she suspects that there are few police officers left who are prepared go the extra mile to nab felons. Although Renée Ballard has her faults—she is tactless, insubordinate, and impulsive—most readers will root for this formidable heroine to prevail over her adversaries."
313,5.0,"Connelly always writes the very best detective novels. The Dark Hours is no exception. Reflecting the chaos and fear during the year of COVID in LA he examines the breakdown of the LAPD. Using it as a microcosm for the ills of society. Harry Bosch has retired and is working some of his cold cases. Never being one to leave loose ends he tackles them with the same procedure he used as a detective. His one time partner, Renee Ballard, realizes that a New Years Eve murder she catches during her night shift has similarities to one of Bosch's cases so she consults him.At the same time she becomes involved in another case involving break-ins and sexual assaults. They have been dubbed the Midnight Men. Two rapists have been striking fear in women leaving no clues. Again, she seeks out Bosch because she trusts him. Ballard sees the LAPD as sluggish with low morale.Bosch and Ballard combine their investigative skills to tackle both cases all the while looking over their shoulders. Ballard has really toughened up since the early days working with Bosch. She is determined to keep on digging until she finds the connections that spell out the truth of both cases. Connelly has truly make LA one of the characters in this novel. He has given us a tour, so to speak, of each area the investigation leads the detectives. He brings to life Sunset Boulevard, the Dell, even how each area can be identified by the street lights. Gritty and full of humanity. I found it quite amazing. Our two heroes, and they are heroes in every sense of the word, are flawed. But this just makes them human. It's easier for the reader to identify with them. They try to shake the LAPD out of its inertia and fight for what's right. "
314,5.0,"A very good book in the series, one I started reading at 12:30 a.m. and finished at dawn (inadvertently echoing the night shift theme). Ballard is an interesting version of the detective who still cares, despite the politics of the job, the recalcitrant public, and, in this novel, the utter burnout of the rest of the LAPD after Black Lives Matter protests and the public discussion of police brutality based on race/defunding. Connelly helps us understand what it might be to be a good cop, wanting to protect and serve, in that difficult environment, without in any way excusing racial profiling. He has Covid in here, too, and I'm glad he's being accurate about that. There are other topical issues addressed here that he also handled well.Ballard has two cases here, and Connelly manages the serial rapist case particularly well. He never details the rapes. We get they're long and humiliating, but he never names a body part beyond eyes, and I think that's wise. Because as a woman, sometimes I feel male mystery writers are too fond of the woman in the fridge trope and sometimes the way they detail torture and rape of females in their books makes me think they have a little bit of rapist in them too. I end up creeped out not by the story, but by the loving semi-erotic way the author details the violence. But not Connelly. He manages to convey that it was awful without being exploitative. That's a fine line to walk and would have kicked the book up a star, but I'd likely have rated it five anyway.The other case brings Harry back in, and it's interesting to watch him phase Harry out, to show Harry getting older, battling disease, battling empty nest syndrome. He's very helpful to Ballard, of course, and they solve a difficult murder case. I am so, so grateful to Connelly for not using ghostwriters or marrying an embarrassingly young bimbo and letting her ruin his series, and for his continuing to allow me to enjoy his particular style and worldview. May he continue to write one a year until the year I die.ETA: this is my 1000th goodreads review. I'm happy it's such a purely positive one. : )"
315,5.0,"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Any new book by Michael Connelly is a cause for rejoicing and The Dark Hours is a great book: well-written, engrossing, and exciting. It just makes me a little sad.Maybe it’s because Connelly’s other day job for the past 8 years or so is executive producer of the Bosch TV series (and its new incarnation, Bosch: Legacy debuting in 2022), and that means he’s writing and thinking about Bosch as a character all the time, but I feel Harry Bosch is now a secondary character in Connelly’s books. While The Dark Hours is tagged right there on the cover as “A Renée Ballard and Harry Bosch Novel,” it’s much more Ballard than Bosch. Yep, Harry is in it, but he’s just along for the ride, which includes two big cases Ballard is involved in, one involving a New Year’s Eve killing of a car repair shop owner with gang ties and the other involving “The Midnight Men,” a duo of rapists targeting women. This is another Connelly book with a fascinating and well-told mix of crime, police politics, but it has the added influence of modern-day life: It’s the first book he’s written that includes references to the pandemic and the George Floyd murder and how much both have changed policing. Ballard is a fascinating character, literally the female version of Bosch, a loner who wants justice to be served, no matter what it takes. But I still want more Harry Bosch in a book tagged as a “… Harry Bosch novel.” And the version of Bosch in this latest novel seems to be a much older man, like old age has finally caught up with him. (In the TV series, Bosch—played by Titus Welliver—has a different timeline than in the books. He’s a Gulf War veteran on TV, a Vietnam War veteran in print, roughly adding at least 15 years onto his life).While I hope Connelly has more in store for Renée Ballard (and can we eventually get a TV series with her as the protagonist, please … I nominate Mary-Elizabeth Winstead as star … she has the kind of quiet intensity the role demands), I want at least one more pure Harry Bosch novel, one that brings him to the forefront once again and includes his daughter, Maddie (there’s a one-line mention of her in this book). I realize Harry is pushing 70 in the books, but please don’t let him fade away. "
316,4.0,"The Dark Hours by Michael Connelly will be released November 9th with Orion Publishing and is described as ‘the brand new blockbuster Ballard & Bosch Thriller’. Michael Connelly is the creator of the phenomenally successful Harry Bosch series of crime novels, as well as being the executive producer of Bosch, an Amazon Studios original based on Harry Bosch. The Black Echo was published in 1992 introducing the world to LAPD Detective Hieronymus Bosch, with Michael Connelly writing more than 30 novels since.Michael Connelly was inspired to write police procedurals/crime fiction after becoming captivated by Raymond Chandler from a young age. He now writes at a demanding pace at nearly a book a year but what is always very important to him is ensuring the authenticity of his stories and that they should reflect our society at any given time. Over the past year there have been many changes to the LAPD policing due the pandemic and the many social protests that have taken place in the US. Michael Connelly felt quite passionate about including these shifts in practice in his novel offering his readers a credible reading experience.The Dark Hours starts off on New Year’s Eve with Detective Renée Ballard allocated the first case of the New Year. She receives a call to attend a scene where a man was shot dead during the annual celebratory gun-shooting-in-the-air-at-midnight party. (An insane New Year’s Eve activity in parts of LA apparently!) Initially the investigation points to accidental death but Ballard soon determines that this was no accident….this was cold-blooded murder. As she delves deeper into the investigation she makes a connection between this man’s death and a cold case from over ten years ago that had been under the remit of retired LAPD Detective Harry Bosch. Ballard and Bosch have a previous history together and, right now, Ballard trusts Bosch as the one person who shares her relentless passion for the truth above everything else.Ballard also has to contend with another even more sinister crime when a woman reports a very brutal assault in her own home. This isn’t the first of these assaults and Ballard has to act fast before there is another victim and before the media picks up on these attacks. The perpetrators are nicknamed The Midnight Men but who are they and what is their modus operandi?The title The Dark Hours infers many meanings. Renée Ballard works the night shift, a time that suits her and her lifestyle, but it also refers to the dark hours of our time, the darkness that pervades society. There were some very dramatic changes in US policing over the last year or so and Michael Connelly made a decision to harness these changes by creating characters and environments that echo a nation’s sentiments. Ballard is frustrated by defunding, by enforced restrictions placed on her by colleagues. She plays outside the box, always outside the rules to achieve the desired results but she is being continuously knocked off kilter with moving obstacles and her exasperation is mounting daily.Ballard and Bosch make a great team. Bosch, now in his seventies, is aging appropriately with each new book and there is plenty of life left in him yet. Ballard is tough, unafraid to raise the dust and see what’s hiding underneath. Together they are a skilled and formidable team, working in tandem and connecting the dots.Michael Connelly writes contemporary fiction, very much capturing the zeitgeist of the time. The Dark Hours feels like a very personal book, one that Connelly felt he needed to write. The two investigations in The Dark Hours give a platform to the impact societal changes have had on policing and, I expect, there will be many who will agree with Ballard’s views on her workplace and the radical changes she sees around her.The Dark Hours is a compelling police-procedural written by a master of his trade, while also incorporating some very thought-provoking themes. Current, atmospheric and absorbing The Dark Hours is another sure fire hit for Michael Connelly."
317,5.0,"Down the Rabbit Hole.Connelly has done it again, another out of the park home run. With Bosch retired and facing his own mortality, one would think the long time detective would be out if the game. However, the man who coined the ""everybody or nobody"" theory of police justice is always ready to return to the frey..Having joined with Detective Renee Ballard during her escapades on the LAPD Late Show desk in the past, Bosch is now Ballard's trusted mentor. When the sky lights up as the New Year arrives, Ballard and her temporary partner, Lisa Moore, are on area stake out for a pair if holiday rapists. However, as gunshots welcome in 2021, a former gang member lies dead in the midst of the revelry.While most would consider the shooting an as accident of the evenrs, Ballard sees questions amid the family's grief. Abandoned by Moore, Renee pulls at the threads and asks the questions, untilshe discovers a connection to a closed case. The detective of record on that case -Harry Bosch.Juggling both the rapes and the shooting, Ballard turns to Busch as her confident and civilian partner. Together the two fight the apathy within the force, growing mistrust of the people, and the good old boy network in an effort to stop the body count and restore justice. Abandoned by her department and betrayed by her fellow officers, Ballard must face decisions about her future on the police force if she wants to protect and serve."
318,4.0,I get so excited when Michael Connelly releases a new book. I love the Bosch universe so much so that I named my son after Mickey Haller. I was super excited about this one. I was disappointed mostly because the book felt very short. I read it in like two days and it wasn’t because i was grinding through it. This was good and I thought it was very well played out and a perfect cliffhanger that Connelly usually doesn’t do like this. I’m sad Bosch is getting so old but it makes sense. Renee Ballard is almost like a perfect reincarnation of Kinsey Millhone but in LA not Santa Barbara and with no loving neighbor. She’s even essentially homeless for most of her book life until this book. She is also reckless and a bad detective like Kinsey. Surely Connelly didn’t just lift her general character from Grafton’s books haha. The likeness was so much so that I kept imagining Kinsey when reading the book. There was even a Santa Barbara reference in the book!Anyway I am guessing the LAPD mentality that he wrote about is exactly what it is like now post-covid. That is a bit scary to think about that people would slump so much but it also makes sense. I wish the world weren’t so polarized and people could see things as they are instead of being black or white. Very sad. Anyway good book. 
319,5.0,"4.5 stars.It's New Years Eve in Hollywood. LAPD Detective Renee Ballard works the night shift with temporary partner Lisa Moore of the Sexual Assault Unit. A pair of rapists called the Midnight Men have been striking on holidays. Also, Renee gets a call to a shooting of a former gang member. The same gun was used in a homicide 10 years before. The investigating officer back them was Harry Bosch. Harry, even though retired, loves to work and wants to help Renee out. So here we go.In this story, there are many, many references to Covid procedures and precautions which is certainly realistic to write about. In LA, the pandemic and protests have been hard on all cops and some are not reacting as well as others. The Midnight Men case has given Renee renewed purpose.Lisa Moore is not a good cop and I didn't like Renee's boss either. Talk about not having her back. I love Renee. She is a superior cop who truly cares about people and the job. I certainly look forward to these novels each year."
320,5.0,"Connelly's best book in several years. It's not a mystery, but a procedural following two crimes, with Ballard hot on both trails. Bosch isn't quite furniture in this one, but his role is small and enjoyable for long-time fans.Connelly reveals what's happening inside police forces during this crazy-ass ""defund the police"" moment in history. He touches on officers simply disconnecting from the mission. Why get out of the car if you're perceived as the ""bad guy,"" subject to criminal prosecution and professional humiliation for doing the job?As a procedural, we learn about many criminal and police techniques I'd be unaware of. The most tragic of these is that in LA there is a 24-hour facility where rape victims are taken for processing. Yeah, let's defund the police when there are so many rapes happening that a city has a full time staff to collect evidence from the victims. As a society, we are completely off track when we allow for this kind of violent behavior while vilifying the police, treating criminals as martyrs, and punishments as wrong because they are (BS) inequitable. What about the innocent women? Doesn't anyone in our leadership give a damn about their safety and their rights? I notice the women who lead the defund the police movement all have private security.I do wonder if the author is accurately depicting things inside the force, where people have their jobs threatened as part of the narrative. Is that stick being wielded when big city police forces are so understaffed?The book has an excellent conclusion, and if there is a sequel, the author can go one of two directions based on the closing pages. He has given us a new Lt. Pounds to loathe and set the new L.T. up for the next book.GREAT narration. Really tops, with excellent direction and production."
321,1.0,"Read this only if you want to have your intelligence insulted. Connelly deftly portrays the physical and psychological deterioration of Los Angeles while remaining utterly blind to it being directly traceable to the leftist views and policies long governing the city. Blind because he holds those views. And holds them with the same arrogance his fellow travelers do: most glaringly, by repeatedly parroting CNN reportage of “storming” the Capitol on January 6, 2021, demanding or at very least expecting acceptance of it as given truth. If he’s not blind, then he’s deliberately trafficking what he knows to be poisonous and destructive ideology. I’m beginning to think it’s this latter because not one drop of the flaunted attitude was necessary to tell an otherwise well-crafted story, which he absolutely has to know under the responsibility of authorship.In any event, I won’t contribute to the propaganda by buying any more Connelly books."
322,5.0,"I really, really like the addition of Renee Ballard in Michael Connelly's books. Renee and Harry have such a unique relationship that totally works. He has become her mentor, partner and friend. Since the book begins New Year's Eve 2020, Connelly touches on the deteriorating public image of the police, as well as the pandemic, including masks and roll-out of covid vaccines, and some of the turbulent political climate. The Dark Hours has 2 different investigations going on, as typical with Connelly's novels. First, Ballard and her NYE partner Lisa Moore are looking into the Midnight Men, 2 rapists that have attacked on holidays. The second case Ballard is looking into is a murder of a local businessman where the bullet found is also connected to a cold case, which, of course, was one of Harry Bosch's about 10 years ago. Ballard enjoys working with Harry because he is smart, loyal and willing to step outside of the law when necessary. I felt like their relationship grew a lot in the book. This was definitely another great book in the Bosch/Ballard series!"
323,3.0,"This wasn't Connelly's best work, not by a long shot. The plot was paper thin, at least the one half, and I assume most observant readers had it figured out a quarter of the way through the book. Renée Ballard remains an incredibly uninteresting and unlikable figure with little in the way of redeeming characteristics. Oh she likes dogs? Well how endearing that she shares that with the majority of the population. Not to mention Connelly's near pathological need to inject current events into the story. Yes people wear masks, yes some morons don't like the police and want them defunded, yes there was an ""insurrection"" on January 6th. Trying to shoehorn current events into a novel is always tricky but this was a series of clumsy attempts that were mostly irritating. It might be time to let Harry retire for real and it is definitely time to put Ballard on the shelf for good."
324,4.0,"Michael Connelly continues to be one of my go to authors when I want to immerse myself into a swift moving police procedural/ thriller. The Dark Hours is the latest addition to a new series built around detective Renee Ballard, a friend and fan of retired beloved detective Harry Bosch. When the two team up, as they fo in this action filled novel, we can be sure of an interesting ride. Seeped in current events such as Covid , Black Lives Matter, street protests and Defund the Police it is clear that change is slow and difficult. The story line is doubled with one story about a mechanic who is murdered during a demonstration. Is this random or related to the man’s former membership in a Latino street gang? As the plot evolved I was fully immersed in the victim’s plight. Additionally, Ballard and her lazy absent partner are charged with helping to apprehend a serial rapist who seemingly attacks randomly in the dark of night. All together the Dark Hours was a good read that held my jnterest and kept me reading well past bedtime."
325,5.0,"Ballard and Bosch, a Dream TeamMichael Connelly has delivered once again. The LAPD has had more than its share of scandals, and recent years are no exception. A satisfying ending, too.Renee Ballard, LAPD detective, has been banished to the late shift because she dared to report an assault that another officer perpetrated on her. Harry Bosch, retired LAPD, did not leave the department on good terms. These two reunite for a case they share leads on, only Harry’s homicide case has grown cold. They work as a solid team, better than actual partners working in the LAPD.Events of the past two years find their way into the plot. The LAPD has serious defects that need fixing, and Renee Ballard is up to the task, if she decides it’s worthwhile. Bosch may again come along for that ride. My favorite book of 2021. It’s a page turner in the best sense. "
326,4.0,"Renee Ballard is establishing herself as one of Connelly’s most interesting heroes along with, of course, Harry Bosch. She’s now the main character of these novels though Harry has her back all the time.Ballard is like a dog with a bone, she just won’t leg go until she gets results. Naturally, she crosses the line sometimes and incurs the wrath of her superiors. All the best cops are mavericks and Renee Ballard is no exception. The Dark Hours has typo plot lines, both interesting and exciting. A really good read.David Lowther.Author of The Blue Pencil, Liberating Belsen, Two Families at War and The Summer of’39, all published by Sacristy Press."
327,5.0,"Harry Bosch Universe #35: What an adventure Michael Connelly kicked off when he published ""The Black Echo"" in 1992. Almost all Mr. Connelly's novels since have continued the story of Harry Bosch and his friends and family. (One exception, ""The Poet"", is perhaps his best work, an odd happenstance.)The present effort pulses with Connelly's magic. He somehow drags the reader into the story. Here we have two detectives, two serial investigations. One is a pure police procedural, the other police work wrapped in mystery. That the experienced mystery reader solves the riddle almost from the moment the crime occurs does not matter. One keeps turning the pages and marvels at the way all threads are brought to a satisfying conclusion. We are left with an implied promise that Renee and Harry will be back although in what straits we do not know. Maybe Michael does?Recommended"
328,4.0,"I have said it before and I'll say it again: I love Renée Ballard. She is one bad-ass bitch (I say that as the highest compliment) and if I ever found myself the victim of a crime, I'd want her to be the detective in my case. The Dark Hours takes place over the course of December 2020 through January 2021, and Connelly encorporates current, real-life events like the covid-19 pandemic and the social justice movement and civil unrest that followed the murders of George Floyd and other Black Americans during 2020, including calls to defund the police. I love that Connelly doesn't shy away from tackling hard topics, especially those that affect his main characters, LAPD officers. That being said, if you're trying to escape from current events, this might not be the book for you. As for me, I appreciate that Connelly doesn't try to pretend like problems within our criminal justice system don't exist and uses his platform as a crime writer to draw attention to those issues; I don't think I could continue reading his books if he didn't. As a huge fan of the television series Bosch, which Connelly created and produced, Renée reminded me a lot of Grace Billets, a lieutenant who made the decision to stand for change as a female leader from inside her department no matter how hard it was for her personally. Even though I'm not in law enforcement, I found myself relating to Renée's internal struggle as she decides whether it's better to take on an institution from within, or leave the institution altogether. I can't wait to see what she decides to do and hope I don't have to wait too long until the next installment of this series!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐ I enjoyed this story immensely, although the Midnight Men storyline was deeply disturbing and made me really worry about the state of our country and how we continue to treat women. The murder case was a little too complicated with everything else going on in the book, but overall this was another solid procedural from Connelly."
329,4.0,"This book stars Renée Ballard with Harry Bosch, now retired, helping her. But she has the limelight here, and behaves more or less as a female Harry would. As usual in a Connelly novel there is more than one story thread going on. In this case, there are a series of murders that need solving, with Ballard calling in Harry Bosch for help because of a connection to an unsolved murder he was working on. At the same time, Ballard is hunting a pair of rapists, nicknamed the Midnight Men, who have developed a pattern, but have been leaving no trace.The pandemic plays a role in this book, and the officers around her are exhibiting low morale. Ballard goes rogue (as Harry was wont to do) and they end up working together, with Ballard leading the way."
330,4.0,"Each year, I read the new Michael Connelly novel as soon as it’s published, and each year, Connelly offers a well-told tale full of credible dialogue that’s loaded with cop jargon and a plot of intersecting cases that are just complicated enough. This year’s edition, The Dark Hours, adheres to Connelly’s annual formula, this time focusing on Renee Ballard with Harry Bosch in a supporting role. And this year, the formula is entertaining just as in the past. The LAPD is worse than ever because of the pandemic and budget cuts, which means the police force is slow moving, ossified, bureaucratic, and in places, corrupt. Which means heroine and hero must break the rules to solve crimes; for them (and for a compelling story) there’s no other way. However, in The Dark Hours, the rule breaking is so extreme, it’s laughable, but mostly laughable in an entertaining way.I won’t say more here. For other insights into Connelly’s novels, see one of my reviews from years past.Note: The Epilogue serves two functions. Renee Ballard is described two weeks after her climatic ordeal, giving the reader a sense how she is doing. Additionally, Connelly sets the stage for a sequel by introducing a combination teaser and cliff hanger for next year’s novel. I’m guessing a year from now, I’ll be in line at the library or bookstore so I can learn what happens next. "
331,4.0,"Overall, I enjoyed the book. It was a quick read. That said, I do not think the writing was as solid as other Connelly books. There are two stories in this book: one about a murder that occurs on New Year's Eve and one about the Midnight Men. The NYE murder story is more convoluted but it is this story that allows Bosch to become part of the book. The murder story had too many named characters who were undeveloped and unimportant which made it harder to follow. IMO, this story lacked the cohesion of most other Bosch books. The Midnight Men story sounded like something that could happen. Although it is an unsettling storyline, I found this to be the more interesting of the two stories. I thought that everything was fairly solid up until Ballard decided to act alone to catch the rapists. Her actions didn't make sense nor do I buy that Bosch would have been agreeable to her scheme. Bosch should have figured out another way to catch the criminals. The very last chapter of the book was weak and not realistic but it will give Connelly options on where he goes from here with Ballard and Bosch. Like many readers, I'm more of a Bosch fan than Ballard so I would like to see a new Bosch novel with some Ballard versus a Ballard novel with a little Bosch. "
332,5.0,"New Years Eve night and all hands are on deck to bring in the new year. Ballard is stuck with another female detective who is just as thrilled as Ballard is to be working this holiday night, but Ballard is hoping that this will bring about another break in a case of serial rapists they have been trying to catch. Ballard and Moore get called out to another shooting, and things don't look at simple, as a stray bullet from celebrations is what killed this guy. Now handling two cases, Ballard is being told she will be giving one of them up, and she knows she cannot let either one go. But with budget cuts, and shortages in the workforce, Ballard knows it will be non-negotiable. She will be told, and not given the options so she does all she can to untangle the truth and prove she is too far in to just hand it over, and then another attack happens and she now has two cases competing for her time. I really enjoy Detective Ballard and her no-nonsense like Bosch. Another great storyline and I really like how he also includes current events into this novels. It just adds that much more to the storyline and makes it seems more real. I also like how he still works to pull Bosch into these storylines to help Ballard."
333,4.0,"LAPD Detective Renee Ballard works the Late Show, alone and she likes it that way. In this fourth Renee Ballard and Harry Bosch book Renee is off the beach and her beloved Pit bull has passed away, but she’s still loathed by everyone in the department. It’s the edge of the pandemic and post George Floyd. No one likes the police but they still call when there’s a rape or a murder, and both have happened at the beginning of the new year.It’s a tradition in LA to fire your gun in the air at midnight but this 2021 midnight a former gang member has died at the stoke of 12. Renee is called to the scene and she knows it wasn’t the result of accidental revere. She’s also investigating two rape cases with similar MOs and now there’s a third. It’s busy in the City of Angels.Renee stops at retired detective, Harry Bosch’s for some coffee and advice before heading home to sleep off the grime of crime (sorry). Harry’s the one person she can trust and he was a good cop, even though he’s recently worked with Mickey Haller (The Book of Innocence book 6 of 6 in the Mickey Haller series, and not my favorite Connelly book.). I love Connelly’s books. I order every one and share them with my neighbor, also a Connelly fan. Harry’s the best. A constant in every Connelly thriller. The introduction of a female protagonist was welcomed but by book four I’m ready to know Renee a little better than that she’s a badass who can fight off a surprise attacker, crush his windpipe and perform a tracheotomy to save his life. What’s the scoop with Renee? Why the lone wolf attitude? How’d she go from Pit Bull owner to Chihuahua? All-in-all The Dark Hours is page turning entertainment. "
334,4.0,"Once again this book shows that Connelly is still the master of the genre. Despite not reading a Connelly book since his last one (a year ago?) I got into the book right away. The writing is easy to read and follow and I quickly got back into Renee Ballard's world.Spoilers ahead, don't read if you don't want to be spoiled:There are two plots in one. I now realize that it's because each plot line is too short to make into a full book, or if it did, it would be have too many fillers or too long/boring. The first time I ever came across that was in the Judge Dee mysteries and apparently that has been done for many years by ancient authors.Anyway one of the plot is about the Midnight Men, two rapists who tie up women and rape them. By careful investigation of the latest rape case, Renee finds part of the MO of the rapists and is able to back correlate it to previous rapes. She is alerted to something similar happening and uses that to bait herself and catch them. The second story is about a killing of a ex-gang member. By carefully following the money trail she is led to people who have an interest in his death.Of course since this is Connelly and also a Bosche book, there are plenty of interpersonal spats and intra-departmental infighting, though some of it seems a bit forced. This book only gets 4 stars because the depth of the writing seems to be Connelly-lite. The earlier books seem grittier, darker, more dramatic, edgy and dangerous. This is more of a coffee table thriller if there's such a thing. Some of the older Connelly books I couldn't put down and I had to keep reading until 4-5am, not so with this one. Still it's a worthy book and I can always imagine the joy of people discovering Connelly for the first time. Connelly, if you read any of these reviews I hope you come up with a magnum opus to end your run and not just these lite novels. "
335,5.0,"Full marks to Michael Connelly for addressing the crime of sexual assault in his latest book and not just murders. It’s much more common and just as important. He’s been using his latest books to shine a light on relevant issues and does it in a way that isn’t annoying like other authors. He included the defund the police movement, capitol riot, vaccinations, masks, and coronavirus as relevant social issues. I always appreciate his insight because it isn’t based on his one opinion but from many he interviews for research. The book itself was really good if somewhat predictable. He rolls out many of his tried and true literary devices he’s used over the years but it was still a very satisfying story. Definitely worth the read. "
336,5.0,"An Outstanding read! It is hard to beat a Detective Novel written by Michael Connelly. He is the Master of criminality. And, he always uses the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as background for his stories. If you have ever lived in the LA area of California, Connelly will always bring you home again to revisit places you are familiar with. In his current novel, The Dark Hours, Connelly brings retired Detective Harry Bosch and Detective Renee Ballard back together once again to utilize their combined expertise in solving two major crimes along with a trip down Sunset Boulevard. A true page turner."
337,4.0,"Renee Ballard finds herself working the dark hours on New Year's Eve. She is called to a murder scene and begins the task of trying to find out what happened. Her case appears to link to a previous murder that Harry Bosch had been assigned. He wasn't able to figure out who the killer was, but had some guesses. They team up to work on it. At the same time, Renee is working on a duo rapist team that has been targeting women on holidays. Her partner, Lisa, leaves town and has Renee holding the bag on that one too. Renee is still coming to grips with losing her detective shield and finds she likes working the night shift. She has had several changes in her life and appears to be moving forward. Although her life is not ideal, it does appear to be getting better. In true Bosch fashion, Renee also butts heads with her co-workers and superiors. She does what she feels is right. She also feels disheartened by the lack of work ethic by some of those she works with. She finds herself relying more and more on Harry to help her instead of her work colleagues. He steps up without question and is there for her when she needs him. I liked their dynamic and am hoping to see more of it. The story was entertaining and did a good job of moving along at a good speed. Am interested to see what happens with Renee. "
338,4.0,"Connelly gets better and better, IMO, and that's coming from someone who hasn't read all of his books. In recent years, I've become more aware of the Bosch storyline, both through a handful of the novels and the show, which is excellent. I jumped at the chance to follow Renee's storyline with 'The Late Show' and have been impressed with his handling of her journey ever since. Minor, minor gripes are that a) in a few spots, the police speak is so mechanical that you feel like you're reading a handbook on crime scene procedure and b) a few chapters end with poorly phrased buddy-cop exchanges, but those are minor, minor cons in what is arguably a very satisfying read. "
339,5.0,"The best Bosch/Ballard partnership to date.Took me awhile to come around to Bosch having a mentor/ partnership with Ballard. He was such a loner, even when teamed up with a partner in earlier novels. There's a line in the book about the younger, often female, partner who gets assigned writing the warrant applications, typing the reports, etc. that I remember Bosch doing in earlier novels, often when he felt the junior partner was not pulling his/her own weight. Now he's out of the dept, and trying to get a feel for the squad room after the BLM protests have decimated morale, and taken its toll on the dept both young and old alike.I recommend the book because Michael Connelly beautifully weaves how both crimes being investigated are being solved by a ""go knock on doors"" mentality."
340,5.0,"The Dark Hours was an outstanding and addictive read. This was essentially a Renee Ballard novel with Harry Bosch only being a peripheral character. That was fine with me as it was super engaging from start to finish and Renee is just as great to go with as Harry.What made this such a great story was that the writing never got in the way of the story. Told in solid third-person limited and past-tense, the narrative was brisk and never bogged down in exposition. It was very easy to read the relatively short chapters and scenes and I could hardly put it down as Renee went from one bit of mystery to the next.The conclusion was also highly satisfying which was a huge plus. I love this stuff and only wish the author would do the same with his Lincoln Lawyer series instead of writing it in first-person. Oh well, at least I’ve had all of these novels to enjoy. Very highly recommended."
341,3.0,"(3 1/2). Kudos to Michael Connolly, he finally turns Renee Ballard loose and does a great job. Harry is here, but he is mostly an insignificant side character. This is Renee's show, and she peels back the layers in the traditional procedural way that made Connolly a rock star. We have two cases here, and it takes a while to unravel them, so this is not a short book, but it all works. I am glad to see one of my favorite authors get his mojo back. Good stuff."
342,4.0,"Connelly weaves in the effects of the pandemic, protestors, defund the police movements and even the Capitol insurrection with this story featuring Detective Renee Ballard and a healthy dose of Harry Bosch. Of course, Renee goes almost full lone cowboy which always irritates me but the separate cases were well developed though I guessed the reasoning behind one of them very early on. It's a tough time to be a good cop in our country and Connelly captured that."
343,4.0,"What is there to say?! Pure Michael Connelly through and through! Two cases, a murder of a former gang member and a pair of rapists called the Midnight Men. What I liked: the writing, all of the Michael Connelly-ness, the storyline of the Midnight Men. The gang murder story fell a bit short for me. It started strong and then felt like-oops-book is due tomorrow, gotta wrap this up. Still, excited for the next one!"
345,4.0,"Michael Connelly is a master story-teller, and this, the new Ballard and Bosch thriller, is yet another humdinger of a read. I love the partnership between my all-time-favourite detective, Harry Bosch, and (fairly) new kid on the block, Renée Ballard, and couldn’t wait to read The Dark Hours. Once again, the author serves up a fast-paced, gripping and well-plotted story.In The Dark Hours we get to revisit the fantastic teamwork between Bosch, who’s not getting any younger, and the feisty, straight-down-the-line Ballard. Neither is scared of putting in the hard yards, nor waiving procedure when it gets in the way of hunting down the baddies. Ballard finds herself embroiled in two investigations. One is the case of a rare, two-man rape team that targets lone women in their homes after midnight. The other is the murder of a former gang member. His death may have been mistaken for a horrendous New Year’s Eve accident, but Ballard recognises it as a murder. Although not really in her bailiwick, she desperately wants to hang on to this investigation. Things have been bad in the force lately, and this big case may just be what she needs to pull her out of her despair. She’s disillusioned with the job, the department and the people around her. With so much on her plate, she needs the help of her old friend and mentor, and old-timer Bosch is wonderful the way he drops everything to help. Now long retired, he trusts her judgement and is always there for her. There are plenty of ups and downs for Ballard in this story, and we are given further glimpses into her personal life that add depth. There are also loads of police politics and, as usual, references to current affairs. Connelly doesn’t ignore the fact that the story takes place in the midst of a pandemic, and the January riots at the Capitol play their part as well. This author is also wonderful with his brief descriptions of all the minor characters that make them spring off the pages (“his years on the job had also wrapped him in a tight cocoon of inertia”). I really got worked up about Renée’s useless colleague who was defeated by circumstances and spent her time trying to skive off. By contract, Bosch and Ballard give their all, with Ballard literally putting her life on the line to catch the Midnight Men. All in all, a great read. "
346,4.0,"All the latest world news in the book, Michael Connelly has managed to blend the covid , BLM situations in the life of our very own Renee and it is one of the good books of her series. Harry Bosch is as usual meticulous and the man that he is, Renee is grwoing up in her commitments and her views might chart her off to a new direction. The book was entertaining and had enough Bosch material for me to be satisfied, overall a good execution of the book.Recommended for Connelly fans."
347,5.0,"Okay this is the fourth bosch /ballard novel and it is quite good up to the usual standard at least. We have covid, blm, defund the police in the storyline, so some reviewers are upset about these topics get with the times people . Also we have bosch as a secondary character to ballard ,its mainly a ballard novel more than anything else. We have murders, rapists and disechanted police to mention a few. But if you read the story it a good solid crime novel and thats really all that matters to me at the end of the day, so just go out and BUY the book you will not be disappionted."
348,5.0,"I have loved all the Harry Bosch novels, and now I love the Harry Bosch and Renee Ballard novels. Always so exciting with lots and lots of twists and turns in trying to stop the ""bad guys"" from doing terrible things. The novels always feel so realistic to me, although I am sure they are likely more intense than reality. I can't wait until the next book in the series is released."
349,4.0,"The Bosch legacy evolvesI dove into this book because I can't get enough of Bosch and his LA presence. This book focuses on Renee Ballard, a detective with LAPD Hollywood Division during the 2020 pandemic. There is low morale in the department and much apathy shown by her co-workers at all levels. Forced to work solo to get anything done on her cases, she enlists the help of Harry Bosch, a retired yet seasoned detective willing to help her investigate crimes off the book. The story starts out slowly, so much so I almost lost interest. Bosch finally makes an appearance and the story picks up. It is only for this very slow beginning and the books inability to hold my interest that I give this otherwise entertaining novel only four stars. "
350,5.0,"The next installment in Ballard & Bosch, and Michael Connelly really is hitting his stride now. This book is smart and gripping, and I tore through it in no time. As usual for a great read, I was sorry when I reached the end, and we got a bit of a teaser for the next book at the very last. Can't wait for more!"
351,5.0,"Renee Ballard has become my favorite Connelly character-my opinion of Harry Bosch has been negatively affected by the TV series as I despise the actors that play Harry and his extremely annoying daughter Maddie !! I think Connelly may also be bored with Harry as there are many not-so-subtle references to his advancing age. Having said that, this is a fascinating, complex mystery with many twists that keep the reader on his/her toes! Would love to see a book combining Renee and the Lincoln Lawyer!"
352,3.0,"[18 Nov 2021]I don't think this is one of Connelly's best. I enjoyed it but I didn't care very much about either of the cases. Just a few days after finishing the book I can't remember what they were. The most compelling part of this book seemed to be the danger and disillusion suffered by Ballard personally. And Harry's part in the book was important, but pretty limited. "
354,4.0,This was an excellent murder mystery/cop story that was a complete page turner—and that was hard todo since I listened to this as an audio book. The focus on Rene Ballard and her relationship with Harry Bosch made this one a complete joy. Excellent story and hopefully not really reflective of live asan LAPD officer.
355,5.0,"One of the things that has impressed me with Connelly’s recent novels (this one and Law of Innocence) is how skillfully he wove in current events like COVID, BLM protests, movements to defund the police, and the January 6 insurrection. The Bosch series has always been tied to current events that affect the police, so it isn’t a surprise that he chose to include these in the latest installment. I don’t want every novel I read to specifically address these events, but here it would have felt disingenuous to ignore them. I really enjoyed this novel. The two cases Ballard is working are intriguing and the police politics she encounters made for an interesting stumbling block. My one complaint is that this book definitely focused more on Ballard and very little on Bosch. Although I missed the peek into Harry’s thoughts and personal life, I loved the developing partnership and friendship between the two. I’m excited for the next installment in this series!"
356,5.0,"Another installment in a great series. I love Harry Bosch. He’s been in books on his own as the featured character. He’s been paired with the Lincoln Lawyer, Mickey Haller in a supporting role. He’s been paired with Detective Renee Ballard, also in a supporting role. Dark Hours by Michael Connelly pairs Harry with Renee once again. A great detective story with two cases needing solving. This was only the second book I’ve read since Covid that detailed Covid issues in detail (others briefly mentioned it). As it is a police procedural, the author also addressed recent issues with the police. The events take place New Year’s Eve 2020 and early 2021. I love reading books in a series as I feel like I’m visiting with old friends in each new installment. This one was no exception."
357,4.0,"7/10 - Good read, but not one of my favorites from Connelly- light on action and heavy on dialog and exposition. Unlike other readers, I thought the backdrop of the pandemic/BLM/Jan 6th/etc was important in establishing a sense of time and place. The novel is set end of 2020/beginning of 2021. It would be a disservice to the reader if these elements were softened or omitted. It certainly leaned left, but whatever. I have a bipartisan acrimony of most politicians- we're all getting fucked in the end. I just like a good story, and this one largely delivered."
358,4.0,Ballard FanI love Renee Ballard as a character and teaming her with retired Harry Bosch makes for a great story. I really enjoyed the ride - just felt the end was a little rushed and convenient. 
359,5.0,"Renee Ballard is a strong character. Mr. Connelly weaves the discontent to the force from BLM and the Covid Pandemic into a tight narrative with a very good ending. Or should I say set up for next year's book?Only mentioned in passing a couple of times is Maddie attending LA's Police Academy. I thought Maddie would end up at Quantico and be a fed like her mother and the other great love of Harry's life. There seems to be a certain symmetry with that plot line.While I enjoy all of Mr. Connelly's works, I am also interested in Maddie's future."
360,4.0,"Renee Ballard is on duty New Years Eve, along with the rest of the police force, everyone in uniforms to keep the peace. When people start shooting into the air at midnight a bullet comes down in the middle of a street party and kills the host. Ballard catches the case and believes it to be too much of a coincidence. When ballistics is run it mysteriously ties in with a cold unsolved case that Harry Bosch worked years ago. Renee also is helping the sexual assault team and catches a strange case with two perps.Ballard has to think, and work, outside the box to stop and solve these cases and help is not forthcoming from the department. Bosch helps her out but warns her that if she goes too far she might lose everything, her ethics, her job and maybe even her life."
361,4.0,"More Ballard than Bosch. Detailed procedural with much disaffection for LAPD, which seems to protect and serve itself more than its citizens. Ballard goes rogue. The teaser on the last page promises more of both of them."
362,5.0,"Really enjoyed this book. It was procedural but couldn’t wait to get back to it to see what happened next. Renée is a serious cop who teams up with Harry Bosch, another serious cop. I always enjoy Michael Connelly books. "
363,4.0,Another winning book from Michael Connelly that tackles the events of the past year in a tightly woven tale with two of my favorite characters: Harry Bosch and Renee Ballard. 
364,4.0,another good oneGreat job keeping Bosch alive and adding some more credibility to rising Ballard. I appreciate the way Connelly handled the pandemic….he weaves in the real world challenges without the virtue signaling and brow beating about masks and vaccines. It’s a small part of the story but caught my attention because of the prevalence of the topic in some of the series I used to appreciate.
365,4.0,Ballard went a little off-character for me on this one. But it kept me guessing and turning the page. Will be curious to see what happens next!
366,4.0,"It’s hard for me to knock a star off a Michael Connelly book, but this felt just a notch less satisfying than the other Ballard and Bosch books. There were two crimes being investigated. In one, we knew the perpetrators at the beginning, but were treated to B and B’s expert detective skills to gather the evidence to bring the criminals to justice. In the other, Ballad’s detective work was impressive, but the purpose of that storyline seemed to be to illustrate Ballard’s precarious mindset by the end of the book. "
367,3.0,"Not enough Bosch, and it seemed like a bit of a cheat really"
368,5.0,"Connelly is the best.HMr Connelly 's novels are uniquely compelling. So much better than the TV series.. Bosch. May be the same author, but the end product is amazingly different. Go figure. Of course the books don't have a director or a cast. Bosch."
369,4.0,Read about two-thirds of this and listened to the last third which was read by Christine Lakin with an assist from Titus Welliver. This is a Renee Ballard story with Harry Bosch as very much a secondary character. Renee continues to work the night shift and finds herself working on two pretty complicated cases: a former gang member is killed and a pair of rapists seem to be developing quit a string of victims.This is one of the first books I've read where the pandemic figures in lots of the background. Ballard even takes Harry to get his Covid vaccination.
370,4.0,Another solid book in both series. It gets dark though. Well-written and paced. 
371,4.0,Scary because it seems like it could be based in reality.
372,5.0,such great strong charactersThe action happens within the craziness of the pandemic and current political issues of our times. The main character deals with the errant thinking in a world that is sometimes unrecognizable. But that’s the backdrop to a story about a great detective.
373,5.0,Dark hoursFrom start to finish another outstanding Michael Connelly effort. Renee Ballard and her mirror image of a different era Harry Bosch solve two separate criminal conspiracies with the biggest hurdle being the police force itself. Five Stars
374,4.0,"I'm not the biggest fan of Rene, but this one was decent. Needed more Mickey Haller..."
375,4.0,"I got The Dark Hours by Michael Connelly for free for a fair and honest reviewAt the start of 2021, night shift detective Ballard is sat in a car waiting to hear about the latest attack by two rapists called the midnight men, who generally strike on the holidays.However, while she is waiting about this she gets a report of a man killed while guns are being fired into the air to celebrate the new year.However, the previous year 2020 has been one of the hardest, with the pandemic, a disputed general election, and the BLM protests after the murder of George Floyd, mean that the moral of the police is at an all-time low.So, when the murder leads back to an old case of Harry Bosch, she neds all his help she can get.This is the first novel by Michael Connelly, that I have read, however with the writer’s style of writing and the narrative of the story I was never at a loss even though this is the 23rd Bosch story and the 4th Ballard one.Which means I can not comment on how this compares to the previous stories but take it as a standalone.While I Have read a few novels that have mentioned the events of 2020/21 in passing this is the first novel that the events of that year have formed an integral part of the story.Which I think really gave the novel a felling of time and had a real effect on the narrative of the story.As for the two main characters of the novel Bosch and Ballard, with each of these characters being in multiple books, it can feel when as a reader who meets them for the first time.The writer does one of two things makes them a caricature of what the want them to be, so it does not hinder the reader if this is the first book they have read. What I feel Michael Connelly did, is write well developed characters, which when you read a book that is not the first of the series you know the depth of the character and at some point, you think you know that they have changed over time.All this makes The Dark Hours by Michael Connelly a well-rounded novel which I can highly recommend even if this is your first Ballard & Bosch Novel."
376,4.0,"Good solid mystery. I'm a fan of the Bosch books, and Ballard is a similar character."
377,5.0,"I really liked this book. The previous Ballard/Bosch books didn’t capture me at all. Ballard just didn’t seem to gell with me, but in this one, she became more likeable, more Bosch like—more “everyone counts or no one counts”. And it is a good record of a detailed police investigation. She and Bosch found the murderer of the storekeeper. And Ballard was able to track down the dirtbags assaulting women and, putting herself in the place of the intended victim, she disposed of the trash in the only way possible. Whether she returns to the police force to help clean it up, or she teams up with Bosch to form a PI investigation team, I guess we will find out in the upcoming books. I just don’t want to lose Bosch. I want him to go on forever."
378,4.0,Why the covid propaganda? Smh. I loved this story minus the bs covid aspects. Hopefully not another 2 years for the next one
379,5.0,Another winAnother great book in one of many of Michael Connelly’s series! The Ballard and Bosch combo is great! Can’t wait for the next one.
380,5.0,"The Dark HoursAnother great read by Michael Connelly. Bosch is slowing down but not his new partner, Renee Ballard. Together they’re the perfect team. Can’t wait for the next installment."
381,4.0,Love where this series is going. Can't wait to see what happens next.
382,5.0,"It’s very rare for me to give five stars to crime novels, ESPECIALLY when it’s from an author who’s been writing for decades, and yet I had to with this one - it’s fantastic! Renée Ballard finds herself working with Harry Bosch again after a recent murder she was called out to ends up connected to one he worked many years ago. And it seems that these two aren’t the only murders this perpetrator has committed. At the same time, Renée is also working a harrowing case with a male duo who are attacking women in their homes without leaving a trace - but with things so tense at the LAPD lately, she’s not getting a lot of support and it seems the only way she might catch them is to go rogue…It’s really not often that when somebody’s been writing a series for decades that it still feels so original and addictive, and yet that’s exactly the case here. I loved the dual narratives and crimes being investigated, which somehow just worked seamlessly despite the fact that there was no connection between them, and I loved the pairing up of Ballard and Bosch, who both tend to draw outside the lines a little. I think what always gets me with Connelly’s novels (aside from excellent plots!) are the characters - they’re never a clean cut hero type, and yet you find yourself totally drawn to them. I like the fact that they’re troubled and don’t always follow the rules, but generally follow a good moral compass instead. It makes for explosive reading! I devoured this in a day, and found myself desperate for the next instalment as soon as I finished the final page which is always a good sign! Connelly fans will not be disappointed. "
383,5.0,"Great book!I loved it, good characters, believable story, good police work. Harry Bosch is wonderful as usual, as well as Det. Ballard"
384,5.0,"Harry Bosch is one of my favorite detective series. Michael Connelly is a master at absorbing a reader into a plot. Renée Ballard is called out for a murder on New Year's Eve that she is about to solve when it is taken from her and moved to another department. She also covers for another detective in the sex crimes department over New Years when the Midnight Men, a rapist duo, strike again. Renée ends up leaving the police force due to the vindictiveness of her department which results in chaos and everyone trying to cover for themselves rather than solving crimes. Renée starts working with Bosch to solve the crimes because she knows when the fire is hot you have to cook and she moves on leads that direct her to the criminals. Renée is eventually asked to return to the police department because they know she is able to solve crimes, even if it is in an unorthodox way, but the story ends before she makes a decision."
385,5.0,Couldn't put it downGreat storyline picked it up and couldn't put it down! CONNELLY AT HIS BEST. Great characterization and usage of our current times!
386,5.0,"Renee' and Harry back together again for Michael Connelly. The two renegades like doing detective work their own way and it goes against the grain of the LAPD force. Renee' takes on two cases during her midnight shift: one is the Midnight Men a rare pair of rapists who torture their victims all night. The second is a New Year's Eve celebration where gang bangers fire off guns and rifles at midnight and a former 'banger is found dead of a bullet to the head (was it a falling bullet or was it murder?). Renee' isn't getting much help from her LAPD detective compatriots many of whom are disillusioned by society's mistrust of police and the whole defunding process, so she turns to her old pal Harry for help. Of course this gets Renee' in hot water with her supervisors but maybe she doesn't mind being the 'black sheep' of the regime. Page-turning excitement."
387,5.0,Excellent book. Ballard is awesome. She is what you want in the police. Love Bosch and his hands in things. The cases were good. Kept my interest. Filled with action. We will see what happens next.
388,4.0,"Still the best writer of LA police procedurals. Effortless reading joy, Connelly writes well structured plots and keeps the writing simple, drawing you onwards with enthusiastic curiosity. In addition, the current crop resonates with a contemporary commentary. In the previous book, the virus was arriving, now it is part of everyday life, but also a new president arrives and low morale continues in the LAPD with the 'de-fund the police' argument. It all makes it feel of now. What's more to say? Well, my only disappointment is that Bosch is really a cameo part and even when he appears, he says little. However, Renée Ballard is a great character and this is her story. If you are in the Harry Bosch Universe (as a spectator) you'll need no encouragement to read the latest. If you aren't and you like a good police procedural, wow, you've a lot to get your teeth into."
389,4.0,"Another quick and dirty Bosch book. Love how he and Ballard worked together to both untangle a cold case and work a contemporary one. I found the former unresolved in terms of the who, especially with two possible leads as far as who had stolen the murder books: Bonner or Dash. Also liked the layer of SVU / CAP in addition to their usual remits. "
390,5.0,I breezed through this book rather quickly because Harry Bosch and Renee Ballard are the ultimate team and always make for a great story. I love the intricate details like the style of lamp posts that have a part in solving the case. I also love that the author put out a video tour of some of the sites in the book that really helped to illuminate the story in the reader's minds. My only gripe is that the author chose to start aging Harry Bosch many novels ago and now has been put in to a corner because of Harry's age. I would love to have more of the focus be on him since he is one of the greatest protagonists in mystery novel history.
391,5.0,"I like Renee Ballard and Harry Bosch separately and together. This more a Ballard book with Bosch appearances. It starts 12/31/20 which is important because woven into the story line is the weird situations that the COVID pandemic created, the crazy at the capitol and the overall challenges that police are facing in a post Michael Brown world. There isn’t a political spin just the perspective of an LA cop. Those aren’t the story but are factors in events. The two crimes to be solved were interesting."
392,5.0,"This was a fantastic book. This book has a lot of relevant topics covered in it, attitudes about the police, the attitude of the police, perceptions about women, and race. He handles them all very well. On top of that he writes an excellent Ballard and Bosch tale. This was definitely a Ballard tale. It covers from New Years Eve 2020 through January 2021 and deals with serial rapists and the search for a murder. Ballard knows she is on the clock to solve the murder as it will be removed from her case load as soon as it can be and tries to solve it as quick as possible which leads her to Harry and they in turn wind their way through the case. At the same time she is working a serial rapist case and feels the pressure to resolve it before another can occur. She does this all while feeling the heat from her superiors mostly because she is an uppity woman. The inherent sexism is blatant as presented here and does not feel too far from reality. Connelly does a great job as usual. Damn you for being the excellent writer that you are because once again I have to wait for another of your books to be published as I read this one all too fast. Why are you such a good writer as to force me to sit there and turn the pages too fast. Anyway this is another fantastic Connelly novel and I love all his books and can never recommend them enough."
393,5.0,"Detective Renee Ballard is helping on a case involving two men who are raping women. It’s unusual to have a tag team committing sex crimes. Then a former gang member is killed and Renee inherits this case also. As she investigates, she discovers a ballistic match to another case from years before which had been handled by Harry Bosch. She reaches out to Harry and they begin to work together on the case. They had worked together on another case. The combination of the two cases puts Renee in a position where she crossed a line that puts her crossways with her superiors in the department. As she works the cases she begins to question her career in the police department. The book weaves current social issues such as Covid, calls for police defunding and low moral into a good story. "
394,5.0,"Renée Ballard is, in my opinion, Connelly's deepest, most complex character. And she is a tremendous cop, always working for the victims and the underserved. Police work in the ""defund police"" era might have little to do with serving and protecting if not for dedicated cops like Ballard. Connelly knows how cops think and talk. I think this might be one of the best things he has written. Very good book! "
395,4.0,"4.5 stars. Love Renee Ballard character, especially teamed with Bosch."
396,4.0,3.5 ⭐️ 
397,4.0,Always a good read.
398,5.0,"Nothing better than a Renee Ballard and the King, Harry Bosch pulsating spectacle. Connelly proves once again he is the Heavyweight of Noir. A sound piece of work set in a difficult time, he captures the spirit of being a police officer, the sadness of a victim with uncanny talent. No room in this one, for a reader will either dislike or accept an attempt by Michael to bring current events to entertainment. I read, enjoy without any political overtones."
399,5.0,"Another great one from Michael Connelly.Another great book from Michael Connelly. I read a couple of books a month mainly of this genre and his books are some of the best.Dark Hours never has a dull moment and I really enjoy the Ballard/Bosch relationship. Maybe we will see a new series of storys with them working together as private investigators? Plus I could not detect any impossible things occurring to make the storyline work. But then, Michael Connelly is a pro .You will love this story.I would like to see these become a movie or TV series. "
400,5.0,"This is a return to the collaboration between retired Detective Harry Bosch and Detective Reneé Ballard. Always a good Los Angeles crime story, with serial rapists, gangs, and bad cops. The detecting touches on the beginnings of the pandemic and the disillusionment in the police department resulting from, I assume, the Black Lives Matter demonstrations.Crime is up but arrests are down. Ballard notes: “It’s like we don’t even care about victims anymore. It’s protect and serve the image instead of the citizens.” This culminates in the Capital insurrection.It takes a special kind of dedication to keep working to solve crimes, when so many disillusioned police officers are resigning or counting the days to early retirement. Ballard and Bosch have that special kind of dedication."
401,4.0,"Always good to read a Bosch story. Adding Ballard as a potential long term partner is a great direction. This was solid, fast-paced, compelling and a page turner. Happy that Connelly is still going and ever evolving his characters. "
402,4.0,"Sad but TrueCreating a story that accurately reflects the malaise that saturates our society in general and our police departments in particular, Connally does through this story a brilliant autopsy on the L.A. police that exposes why good policemen are quitting in droves. His ""pollyannish"" ending though regarding Reneè Ballard just doesn't ring true. Is there any hope???"
403,5.0,"Another hit from Michael ConnollyI count down to each book’s release and this one does not disappoint. As for the readers “offended” by Connolly’s use of real world events in his story, get over it. It’s not overt as some readers have suggested. Not even close and especially if you don’t believe in conspiracy theories. Enjoy the book, it’s really good."
404,5.0,"As ever, Michael Connelly delivers a great paced novel. Renee Ballard is great and look i forward to her character developing in forthcoming stories."
405,5.0,"My thanks to NetGalley and publisher Orion Publishing Group for the electronic copy.I've read a few of this author's books before but haven't come across Ballard and Bosch teaming up together. I really enjoyed it. It's well-written, fast-paced, and has really believable dialogue that fits so well with the characters. This is all set against the background of the pandemic, BLM protests and police de-funding and protests on Capitol Hill. The police are demoralised and prefer to be reactive (if they must) rather than proactive. However, Ballard is the exception; she's conscientious and determined. Now the night detective, she enjoys her solitude but she's been teamed with Lisa from the sexual crimes unit on this New Year's Eve because they are expecting the Midnight Men to make an appearance - on two holiday nights the two men had raped and terrorised women in the area. Lisa is resentful she has to be there and Ballard has no time for her. After midnight when gunshots and firework explosions mingled over Los Angeles Ballard is called to attend a street party shooting - was it just an accident or was he murdered? With just a bullet casing her only clue she's able to tie the murder to an old case of Harry Bosch - except someone had removed the murder book from storage and she wants to know why. Ballard and Harry begin investigating together - she is determined to hold onto the case for as long as possible before Homicide get their hands on it but their investigations lead them to other unsolved murders where those murder books have also been removed. Now she has two cases running as Lisa lets her down and she suspects a department cover-up. Can she continue in this atmosphere?I really became engrossed in the storylines and the little side stories slipped in to make Ballard and Bosch ""human"".Yes, a good read."
406,5.0,Awesome book. The storyline was very good and the dueling cases were expertly written. Rene and Harry were at their best. This was very well thought out and I loved it! Hope to see more of both of Ballard and Bosch. 
407,5.0,Great readConnelly always writes a consistently great story. I was a little unsure how hee would weave a story line with two great characters. He did it with aplomb. These last two were well worth the wait to get them and wonderful to read on a rainy Midwest weekend. Kudos.
408,5.0,"Another outstanding Michael Connelly police procedural. Long time series favorite Harry Bosch teams again with his mentee Renee Ballard to investigate a current murder case and an old unsolved one as well as having Ballard’s back as she works multiple rape cases with some unusual MOs. One thing that makes this work stand out is that Connelly sets the action in the midst of the Covid 19 pandemic and deals with the impact of 2020s protests and national violence on a large city police department. To date most authors have avoided these times and issues. That Connelly chooses to include them and address their consequences adds depth to his work. As always, the plot grabs the reader and doesn’t let go, the variety of characters ring realistic and interesting, and the setting in LA encompasses gritty areas, upmarket areas, and for Renee always the beaches. This one is a winner. Don’t miss it."
409,5.0,"Exciting, action packed book as always! What saddens me is that I’m afraid this will be the normal of our world today. It seems like it anyway. Michael Connelly is an excellent writer and Harry Bosch and Renee Ballard are two of my favorite characters!"
410,4.0,"Michael Connelly never misses, and he certainly met his usual high standard with The Dark Hours. LAPD Detective Renee Ballard loves working the night shift mostly because she is usually left alone to work her cases as she sees fit. Renee is partnered with an unhappy detective from Sexual Assault, Lisa Moore, and charged with apprehending a pair of rapists known as The Midnight Men who have been breaking into homes in and around the Hollywood are and raping the female owners. As they pursue leads in that case, Renee also works on solving the murder of a local businessman, Javier Raffa, with former Gand ties. Renee is a fierce investigator and often steps on toes in her department, and she is soon in hot water again. She reaches out to retired LAPD detective Harry Bosch, a long-time favorite of Connelly readers. Together they swim upstream fighting the hurdles often placed in their way by the LAPD. Can’t say much more without spoiling the mystery. Suffice to say that you won’t want to put this book down once you get going."
411,4.0,I do like both of these characters. Lots of twists in the dual story lines.
412,5.0,"Excellent. Renee and Harry make a very good team. Two cases covered (which in most enforcement actions, the detectives have more than one case). Intertwined, although, not sure why Renee's bosses seem to hate her so much. One story was a two man team on sexual assault and the other was greed wanting a person business who was a former gang member. Well told and procedurally properly developed. It is one thing to no who did it and another proving in court."
413,5.0,Great story. Michael Connelly rarely misses. And this one was as good as any.
414,5.0,"Renee Ballard works the night shift. On New Year’s Eve she picks up two cases - a man who is shot at midnight when folks are shooting into the air, when another shoots another man purposely, and the case of a woman attacked in her home and viciously raped by two men who invaded her home. With the aid of Harry Bosch, she solves born cases."
415,4.0,Just another outstanding work from one of the masters.
416,5.0,"No Rest for the WearyThere's no rest for the weary (Detective Renee Ballard) in Michael Connelly's newest crime thriller, The Dark Hours. The action starts when an auto mechanic dies after a bullet lands on his head on New Year's Eve. Was it an accidental shooting or a murder hidden during the early morning festivities? And a tag team of rapists is targeting women in the City of Angels. Who are the Midnight Men, and when will they strike next? Ballard teams up with retired Detective Harry Bosch to answer these questions and more. The Dark Hours is a story with multiple meanings. On the one hand, it is a literal reference to the evening shift where Ballard hunts criminals, but on a symbolic level, it is a reference to the times we live in: a time of civil unrest, pandemic, and police mistrust. Michael Connelly paints a vivid picture of this world. Although he doesn't pretend to have an answer these for society's ills, he presents us with a compelling story that reminds it is always darkest before the dawn, but things will get brighter."
417,5.0,always greatLove Michael Connelly and his works. This one was no different. Can’t wait to see what Renee decides. And how Bosch fits in. Gotta believe Maddie will soon be linked in. 
418,5.0,The Dark HoursI have read every Harry Bosch story and I have LOVED every single one. I can see that the emphasis is shifting from Harry to Ballard. I will miss Harry being the main story character but at least he is still involved.
419,5.0,"A fabulous read, hard to put it down. Renee Ballard is becoming a favorite character, and put her together with Harry Bosch and we have a lot of excitement. I also appreciate the time markers in the novel indicating the state of the country and world we are living in and how it affects the people in it.The mysteries and crimes to be solved were interesting and somewhat complicated, and maybe some of the scenes were a little far-fetched -- I think the author is enjoying the Bosch TV series and learning how to make his writing totally visual. (It is kind of weird that I now envision Welliver as Bosch, not the way I was originally envisioning Bosch at all).This story would be great fun as a TV movie. And the writing is, well, it's Michael Connelly, that's why we read it."
420,4.0,"I enjoyed the book, I don't see the need to bring covid into the Bosch universe. It wasn't to bad, I read fiction to get away from everyday things like that."
421,5.0,"Connelly remains the dean of crime/mystery writers. Here Ballard is the star as she tirelessly investigates not one, but two, crimes, neither of which is technically hers to investigate. She finds that she can only rely on the assistance of Harry Bosch to solve them. There is non-stop action and intrigue leaving Ballard with little time for sleep, but time to acquire a new dog."
422,4.0,"This was my first book by Michael Connelly, but after bringing all the terrific Bosch seasons on Amazon, I was looking forward to it. Haary Bosch is only a peripheral character here, instead The Dark Hours focuses on Connelly's newest protagonist, Renee Ballard. A real page Turner. Interesting, intricate and quite plausible plot. Totally satisfying. Highly recommmend."
423,5.0,"Connelly doesn't disappoint.Michael Connelly is one of my favorites. Bosch is one of my favorite characters. Ballard is a newer character with just as much character. This story covers LA cat the beginning of the pandemic and the LAPDs response to cutbacks, protests, and the pandemic with Ballard on the late shift as punishment which actually suits her fine. She gets invited in a homicide and another sexual assault case using Bosch for advice and backup. Of course they get in trouble while investigating. "
424,4.0,"I love all of the Harry Bosch books and the Renee Ballard books are all very good too. That being said, this book is advertised as a Ballard and Bosch book but in fact this is primarily a very good Renee Ballard book. Everything comes from her perspective. Bosch is a tag along peripheral character. Perhaps in the future their books will be more 50-50. Hopefully Bosch is not being put out to pasture.More from both characters please."
425,5.0,Like this author and these characters. This book reveals the tough time being had by big cities in the midst of covid and downsizing of police departments. Good mystery and clever way this team caught the bad guys. Good read.
426,5.0,"As good as ever!Yes, I am a Connelly fan, from his earliest to his latest, so there is no surprise that I like this book. The surprise is that his transition from Heller to Bosch to Ballard is a smooth as it is.Well done, my man, well done!"
427,5.0,"I had my doubts about a Bosch book in which Detective Renée Ballard was the main character and Detective Harry Bosch played second fiddle, a limited one at that. But I loved it. It ended with Ballard having to make a BIG decision, so I hope Michael Connelly is writing another in the Bosch/Ballard series. It can't be published too soon for me."
428,4.0,References to COVID and masks felt contrived to me.
429,4.0,"Renee Ballard does not disappoint!! 4.5* Another gripping story about the investigation of two serial rapists targeting and assaulting young women! Supported by veteran Harry Bosch, Renee does not stop her investigation and her search for justice at the cost of personal danger, rebuke from her superiors or threat of losing her job!I love Michael Connelly books and can’t wait for his next one! "
430,5.0,Ballard & Bosch New chapter in the Renee Ballard story with the lovable Harry Bosch along for the ride.Renee is on night shift with a partner not that interested. They are surveying the streets for the midnight men. Two men who have been assaulting women. Then while on New Year’s Eve a ex gang member gets shot. Was it bullets being sprayed in the air to celebrate or something more!Great stories looking forward to The decisions & were Renee is headed. Highly recommend.
431,5.0,Fantastic fast paced read! I enjoyed the Audible version and print versions as well. The performance on the Audible version was top notch and engaging with two voices Bosch and Ballard. Totally recommend for those who love crime fiction. One of the best yet from Michael Connelly.
432,5.0,As usual a great Connelly book. Anything with Bosch is good even though his role was limited. Ballard is a strong independent cop in difficult times but does what’s necessary in spite of lazy corrupt cops. Nice to read an up to date current day story with Covid going on. You will enjoy this story 
433,5.0,"I have read all of Michael Connelly’s books and I have to say this one is definitely a special favorite. Ballard and Bosch are together again. The story is so timely and LA is a very much a character in it—this CA city is important in many of Connelly’s books, but extra here. The author keeps us guessing until the very last word. I am usually a rather slow reader but this one I honestly could not put down (a cliche, I know, but so true of The Dark Hours)."
434,4.0,"A Ballard/Bosch story is always fast moving and adventurous. Following all the rules of the police department isn't something the 2 of them always do to the letter, but they do work well together to solve the unsolvable."
435,5.0,"I enjoyed this one a lot! Fast paced and a quick read, just like all his other books. Just what I needed to take my mind off during the holiday rush. And for those that gave this a one star because of the author’s political stance, I doubt you would’ve given it a bad review had he taken an opposite view. You would be praising him if he was an antivaxxer and an all lives matter clown. Most creative minds are liberal thinkers, that’s just how our brain works so good luck finding good novels that are written by conservatives. Maybe you’ll find one or two. "
436,5.0,"I always enjoy Michael Connelly novels and Harry Bosch has been a favorite character. I have not liked Renee Ballard as a character in the previous books nearly as much but in this novel, I think she is better developed and more interesting (perhaps because she has been developing for 4 novels now. Perhaps she is more like Harry Bosch now, but then again she is her own character personality. I liked the pacing and story of this novel and I had a hard time putting it down."
437,5.0,"This is definitely one of Connelly's best novels with Renee Ballard. She tends to be somewhat frenetic in her previous books but seems to have (mostly) slowed down and has matured a lot over the course of four books. Harry Bosch has aged and has slipped into the mentor role, which keeps her on the right path. The book takes place during the early part of the pandemic and highlights the unrest in police departments and the country in general during the last year, but doesn't dwell on it. Solving the mystery is definitely Renee's sole mission. I listened to this as an audio book and it was very compelling to want to finish."
438,4.0,One of the better ones.
439,4.0,4.5*
440,4.0,One of Connelly's better ones
441,5.0,"Some authors and some series start to get stale after a while and lose their punch. Not so Michael Connelly, Harry Bosch or Renee Ballard. This is a real page turner (though I listened to the audiobook so no actual pages to turn).The story and plot are well crafted and move along at just the right pace while the narrators perform perfectly. One of my favourite books of the year."
442,5.0,"I have read every Harry Bosch book and now the most recent book. While Harry has been the major character in his books, the author introduced a new character “Detective Ballard” several books back. She comes forward with all her empathy and professionalism to solve two cases . A serial raper and a murder victim. Ballard asks Harry to help out since he is retired and the best detective in LA. Together they use experience and instinct to solve both cases. I am never disappointed with Harry and Ballard on the police beat!"
443,4.0,"perfect Michael Connelly, the master of the police procedural -- and more, because beyond the methods and tools, he dives into the culture of police officers today, in the wake of George Floyd, Defund the Police, Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, and more."
444,4.0,Like the Ballard / Bosch combination. 
445,5.0,"The Ballard and Bosch train rolls on. Another great story that keeps your interest and your reading in the fast lane. I am an avid Bosch fan and was a little disappointed when he retired and I thought I would lose his fascinating stories and his gritty personality. However, that was not the case and Connelly has introduced me to an equally intriguing detective in Renee Ballard and still gives me a nice taste of Bosch on the side. I was a little concerned near the end of this story that Ballard as an LAPD cop might be going away as well but the Chief smartly stepped up and we have another story to look forward too, although a Bosch and Ballard partnership as PI’s could be a winner too. As I have said after reading every one of this series, hurry up with the next one."
446,4.0,"Can't get enough of Michael Connelly's charactersAnother nicely woven plot. Not too deep, but certainly holds your interest. Leaves you wondering just where Ballard will go next. Would like to see more Bosch involved, just to keep Harry as a key player."
447,4.0,"Score!! This was the best Bosch in a while. It was current with ""defund the police"" and the pandemic playing in the back ground. The Late Show is still the home of Detective Renee Ballard of the LAPD. Renee appears to be a courageous crime fighter straddled with a lazy unmotivated partner and a department that has been demoralized by current events yet she take her cases on like a bull dog. And in the end she saves a would be victim of rape from her ex-boy friend's scheme for revenge. The case takes Renee and Bosch into the ""dark web"" and the crimes and crimminals found there. A really refreshing slant on Michael Connelly beloved detectives."
448,5.0,"FunRideAs always, Connelly never fails to deliver - great story that starts out slow and builds to a great conclusion - I couldn’t put it down after the two cases started to come together. Could have used a little more Bosch, but really captured the current issues faced by police everywhere - glad that Ballard might get back on the force……"
449,5.0,His best yet. I’m blown away by his empathy for women working in a male-dominated profession.
450,4.0,Ripping
451,5.0,Loved this book! The only downside is probably having to wait a year for the next one to come out. Bosch and Ballard make a good team even if it is off-books. I also liked that Michael Connelly wrote the pandemic and all that goes with it in this book. So many authors are avoiding it but this will always be part of our history. We cannot avoid it.
452,5.0,"Exciting and relevantIt almost seems that it would be impossible to create an exciting story using the events of the pandemic and the defund the police sentiment of 2020. It is not impossible and this book is the proof. Renee Ballard seems an unlikely hero but she is a smart and savvy detective who Harry Bosch respects and partners with. This book captures the reader immediately and doesn't let go, even after the last words have been read. Please give us more Ballard/Bosch, Mr. Connelly!"
453,5.0,"The Master Still HasItAs one of Connelly's most loyal fans--and an author of crime fiction myself--I have come to expect a superb, gripping read every time I start a Connelly book. This is one of his best recent efforts, and by that I mean that I gobbled it down in two back-to-back sittings. Like every Connelly book, it is a superb blend of the familiar, the surprising, and the shocking. You cannot read a better book this week. Next week? Quien Sabe!"
454,4.0,"Harry Bosch has more of a cameo role in this book, but Renee Ballard alone is well worth the read. Connelly continues themes raised in previous works where the police administration and politicians are only slightly less villainous than the real bad guys Ballard pursues. In this case it is a pair of home invaders/rapists and a hit man who was responsible for an old murder investigated by Harry when he was still with LAPD. "
455,5.0,"I've read all of Michael Connelly's books, and to say I'm a big fan of this author would be an understatement. The ""Dark Hours"" which features detective Renee Ballard, is one of his very best. Harry Bosch plays a more minor, albeit important, role, but Ballard is the main character. She is the female version of Harry Bosch and is exposed to more danger and excitement than Harry has been in many episodes. I had trouble putting this book down and lost hours of sleep reading it. If you're a Micheal Connelly fan, do not miss the ""Dark Hours""."
456,4.0,"Working the ""Late show"", Rene Ballard gets involved in not one but two high profile cases. And is partnered with a lazy detective who would rather be lying on a beach with her boyfriend than actually working. So Ballard goes about investigating on her own. One case intersects with another old, and cold case where Harry Bosch was the lead detective. As Ballard always considered him her mentor, she draws him not only into that case (which intersects with Bosch's old case) but also into the new case (a sex crimes case).At the end of the book, what will Ballard's decision be? Can't wait for the next book in this series!"
457,4.0,"You can’t go wrong with Michael Connelly. He is a writer in a class all his own. I am liking the Ballard series more and more as we get to know Renee. Of course it is always good the check in with Harry. Two intriguing cases, and two outstanding detectives. The portrayal of the political climate in LA. was also well done. "
458,5.0,"Exceptional StorylineMichael Connelly, just writes so very well. This was an excellent trip, and I really enjoyed it. Renee and Harry work so very well together. I look forward to seeing more about them. This is a tight tale, and executed perfectly. Thanks for a great read Michael! "
459,4.0,"I would have given this book five stars if Connery had gotten political at the end. No police officers died as a result of the storming of the US Capitol on January 6th. He knows this, and shouldn’t have put in that false information."
460,5.0,Excellent book. Michael Connelly hits a home run!Renee Ballard and Harry Bosch are a super team. The book is timely and well written. Detective Renee Ballard is a terrific character. Teaming her with the retired veteran homicide detective Harry Bosch is a master stroke by a great mystery writer. This book is well worth reading.
461,5.0,Classic ConnellyExcellent read. Compelling plot and reliably quick pace. I loved the interplay between Bosch and Ballard and the further development of her character. Classic Michael Connelly.
462,4.0,Renee Ballard picks up the case of an ex gang member who was killed during New Years celebration. It turns out to be murder but the case is supposed to be shifted to another jurisdiction. Renee wants to keep investigating and drags her feet about turning the case file over. She also gets a case the looks like a serial duo is home invading and raping and torturing single women. She is paired up with a female officer from the Sex Crimes office but ends up having to work the case mostly alone. Along with trouble from he boss and the overall police discontent with the de-fund the police the mood of the office is why do much which irks Renee. In the investigations she calls on Bosch for some off the books help to get things done since one of her cases touches on an early case Bosch had. As always Connelly has written a good read to keep you up reading.
463,5.0,"change can comeSometimes you have to feel the job to do the job. Ballard does. And unlike Harry, she’s not yet done fighting beasts from the abyss."
464,5.0,"In the first three books of the Renee Ballard and Harry Bosch collaboration, the young detective picked up a few tricks of the trade from the old LAPD warrior. It was hard to say if this contributed to her preference for or dismissal to The Late Show. At any rate, that's where Det. Ballard now resides in The Dark Hours, and she does some things in a couple cases that essentially top Harry's personal record for pissing off the brass and ensuring that Everybody Counts or Nobody Counts.Bosch is finally - probably finally - out of the Los Angeles Police Department. This of course is the literary world of Harry Bosch, not the TV world. But never say never, and that doesn't stop him from pitching in when Renee needs some help or a firearm.At least she's now in an apartment, and, like Harry, has a canine companion to keep company."
465,4.0,"A solid addition to the Bosch universe. Connelly delivers interesting and believable story lines and characters as usual. The audiobook version is good. I love Titus Welliver; Christine Lakin is fine.Connelly makes a few references to COVID issues because it's set in the past year (20/21). The reviews complaining of him politicizing this book or harping on masks/vaxing are simply ridiculous. He treats the issue with kid gloves. Historians and sociologists will have loads of work for decades to come trying to explain what went wrong with America during the Trump/COVID years. Public health & safety measures across the board (stop lights, speed limits, sewage treatment, hand washing in restaurants/hospitals, mask mandates, immunizations, etc.) exist so that the ~8 billion humans on this planet can live together without inadvertently killing each other. Oh. Oops.Did I mention this is a good and entertaining book? That's why I started all this!"
466,5.0,What a ride !Renee Ballard is one of my favorite characters. This is a crazy exciting addition to her story . Wow! Wow!
467,5.0,Connelly never disappoints…I thought this book well written and the plot well thought out…thank you Mr Connelly for another great read! I am always glad to read anything associated with Bosch and Renee Ballard is the perfect addition.
468,4.0,I think book is much improved from the last one with Harry and Renee. Renee does work the nerves a bit with her behaviors. It was interesting having a book set during the pandemic and showing some of what it may have been like for the police. 
469,4.0,"While Rene'e Ballard is an interesting character, I sure would like to see their rolls reversed! I miss Harry! Mr. Connelly ,you have made Bosch a bit player . And he is who we want to see! I really like your books, especially the Horonimus Bosch books. "
470,4.0,"One of my favorite book universes, so I couldn't miss a new addition. Renée Ballard is back and with a little help from her mentor, Harry Bosch, is working on new case. This time she is working on rape case, but also on murder somehow connected to Harry's old case. I have to say, it is first book I read from post Covid world, but Covid is not the only actual topic, which is included. The Dark Hours is another great crime story from Michael Connelly and I enjoyed it. "
471,5.0,"Another good, solid outing for Connelly. The lead once again is Renee Ballard, and again she poses a problem for the LAPD in her determination to find justice in an unjust world. In the course of investigation, Harry Bosch is drawn in and teams with Ballard in an unofficial capacity. I can't go into more detail without giving spoilers, so my review ends with: ANOTHER WINNER!"
472,4.0,This story was full of incident with two major crimes to investigate. Renee Ballard of the police detective night shift calls on her retired colleague Harry Bosch for his past knowledge and expertise. I’m beginning to get reconciled to Renee and getting some insight into her character. But I can’t reconcile to a retired Harry who is second fiddle to Renee and distanced from his adult daughter who is pursuing her own life. What will become of him? Can’t Connelly go retro and show us some cases from Harry’s past career?
473,5.0,"Best Connelly yet, Ballard and Bosh off the chain! Ask for this book for Christmas!"
474,5.0,"Connelly is back on his game. I’ve been disappointed by what seemed to me formulaic outtings, the last couple of books. With “Dark Hours” I felt Connelly revived his characterizations and plot structure to much the way things were in the golden Bosch years. Reneé Ballard wasn’t simply (I apologize) Bosch in a skirt. The two characters could interact without seeming to be mirrored images or fraternal twins. With references to the pandemic and 1/6/21, it’s also in-time. Evil’s afoot and it’s not all corruption at the top of LAPD and City Hall. These, for me, were all positive developments. I enjoyed “Dark Hours” very much. "
475,5.0,"Connelly Up to His Highest StandardI have been with Harry since the very beginning, introduced to him by one of my students in an AP English class so many years and books ago. There have been ups and downs along the way, Harry leaving LAPD and Ballard coming aboard. I have noticed how somehow some writers get sloppy or bored with their characters (are you listening Lee Child?) but not Connelly. “The Dark Hours” is one of his very best. Harry is clearly second fiddle here so that clears the way for Connelly to feature Ballard’s growing disillusionment with the police. Part of this comes from the police confusion about the growing public suspicion of the police: some of the blue line have come to phoning it in, but not Ballard. I am liking her more and more especially as she gives us evidence of her coming to be like Harry when he had his frequent runins with his superiors. I have, of course, watched all of the TV episodes and I am waiting to see what direction Connelly will take him in now that he is off the force. But for now I am delighted to recommend “The Dark Hours” to fans and newcomers."
476,4.0,"There has been a lot of advertising of this new book. It was good! But the swearing in it is over the top and unnecessary, really! Come on Mr. Connelly, you can write an excellent book without all of that."
477,4.0,"Connelly is one of the very best at these procedural crime stories and his protagonist, whether Ballard or Bosch, are perfect for the detailed approach he takes. They are both bulldogs, relentless in their approach to their job and their intent to get the back guy without any compromises. And as shown very well in this story, neither have any tolerance for cops who don't care, take short cuts or are in any way, part of the problem.This is another good one by Connelly, but a little bit slow for my liking...and sometimes I have to admit I get a little bit frustrated with both of these characters as they are so very bull headed. However, they never disappoint in regards to moving along a good yarn. Both are very good at presenting that ""me against the world attitude"" that often provides for many opportunities for conflict and a good story."
478,4.0,I wish there was a wee bit more of Bosch but otherwise this series just keeps getting better with each installment. You really can't go wrong with Connelly. 
479,5.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this one. Slightly slow start as we get to know the characters and the situation, but it makes for a really solid plot and good characterisation. I think this is the first time I've met Renée Ballard (being more of a Haller fan than a Bosch one until now) but I'll go and read the others she's appeared in very soon. I liked her a lot and she was certainly Bosch's match on the page.In this story, Ballard is looking into two crimes - rapists who strike during popular holidays, and an unsolved murder that has links to an old crime Bosch worked on. I kept interest in both story strands and enjoyed the tension building up over the course of the book.I always admire characters who are really competent, and you can believe in Ballard's police work (albeit I have no actual knowledge of police work, so this makes it easy for me!). Ok, perhaps she takes it too far towards the end, putting herself in danger to chase people down - but isn't that what we want memorable characters to do?A good read."
480,3.0,"Failed to astonish me but a few 4-star moments to lean on!This book is about five young adults stranded at the airport as all flights are cancelled due to snowy weather. All five have never met and are complete strangers. They randomly meet, find out they are all headed in the same direction and decide to rent a car to make the six hour trip. We find out early that one of them has been stalking the main character. But who is the stalker? That you have to finish reading to find out. Things start to go wrong pretty fast. They encounter a huge snow storm, things are constantly going missing and everyone starts pointing fingers.Overall this had a relatively decent pace. However, I found myself pushing through a few bouts of boredom.  There was a handful of scenes that picked up and really got my heart racing, but unfortunately these were in the minority.  I feel like this author has a lot of promise and I would definitely consider reading another book of hers.*Thank you to Sourcebooks Fire via Edelweiss & NetGalley for providing the digital review copy!"
481,4.0,"Normally I’m a little tough grader when it comes to YA thrillers and after seeing some unpopular reviews I was afraid of being bad guy with a acidic taste in my mouth after reading something illogical and not entertainingly crazy enough for my picky taste! But thanks to literature Gods, I couldn’t be so wrong because I was already hooked and felt like watching a fast paced, breath taking, captivating, low budget Blumhouse teenage thriller movie which is 6.5 IMDb and %70 rotten tomatoes rated, mostly takes in one place: a haunted, disturbing car! It was entertaining, mind blowing, surprising, twisting and plot idea was also simple, action packed and brilliant!Our heroine, sweet, artsy, good daughter, 18 years old Mira wants to go to Pittsburgh for Christmas holiday but after unexpected canceled layover because of sudden terrifying blizzard lurking around and her urgent wish to be at home just in time(Her mother keeps secret her divorce news and she is at the verge of nervous breakdown after her sister passed away) forces her make a quick decision to travel with four strangers trapped in a car at snow blizzard. Yes, not a wise choice! But her seat mate at the plane, Harper seems like cool, sophisticated and friendly. She cannot be a bad person, can she?The guy with crutches, blonde hair seems charming and nice, too. His name is Josh. And the med student, tall, wealthy boy Brecken seems like a little pretentious but he seems harmless. And Kayla the weird girl who reminds us of sleeping beauty contest winner seems like quiet, introvert,silent one. Yes, they are a bunch of cool college kids and they cannot cause any harm throughout their exciting, thrilling journey. Right?Sorry Mira, you cannot be so wrong because one of them is ugly soul twin of Joe Goldberg and she or he is watching every step you take and every move you make!Harper- she is way too friendly and secretiveBrecken seems like violent oneJosh becomes more agitated at each moment and Kayla seems like a drug addict with sociopathic tendencies.One of them is after her and he/she won’t stop till his/her mission accomplished.The ending was a little foreseeable and there are so many coincidental facts to bring those five strangers together.But overall: I drank whole bottle of Chardonnay in twenty minutes and I became more agitated, jumpy during the horrifying action packed scenes. I screamed, I jumped, I shouted too many OMGs (my neighbors thought I was performing a rite. Coincidentally my husband was listening” I’m a believer” from the Monkees at the highest volume: he loves 60s music and I endure everything for him leaving me alone when I’m reading) It was fun, it was joyful and I had amazing time.Of course I’m cutting points for illogical and coincidental events affect the credibility of the story but I’m still rounding 3.5 to 4 stars! It was a quick, nail biter, hair splitter, couch jumper, husband disturber, witty journey for me! I enjoyed it so much!Special thanks to NetGalley and Sourcebooks Fire for sharing this interesting ARC with me . Thankfully it was soooo much better than I expected."
482,4.0,"**3.5-stars rounded up**Mira lives in California with her Dad, while her mother lives in Pittsburgh. With Christmas approaching, Mira is making her way to the East Coast for the holiday.Last year, Mira's Aunt, her Mom's sister passed away and her Mom has really struggled coping with that loss. Her sister was her best friend.Concerned about the state of her mother's mental health, Mira expects her to need extra support through the holiday. So, when her connecting flight from New York to Pittsburgh gets canceled due to inclement weather, Mira needs to find another way to get home as quickly as she can.Luckily, the girl she was sitting next to on the plane, Harper, is renting a car along with three of her college friends, Brecken, Josh and Kayla.There is room left in the car and they are heading in the same direction, so Harper offers Mira a ride. It sure would beat any of the other options, like sleeping at the airport on Christmas Eve.Mira accepts, but has some reservations. These people are complete strangers.As they hit the road, the weather gets progressively worse. They see a lot of accidents and even have a few close calls themselves. As you can imagine, the stress level in the car begins to ratchet up.They're at each other's throats and it's not pretty.Anything that could possibly go wrong, does. Conditions get to the point where they are barely able to drive at all.They make a few pit stops and yep, you guessed it, those don't go well either!I had fun with this one, y'all. Richards did a great job of bringing your typical Teen Scream to the page.The cast of characters played well off of one another and it definitely kept me guessing. There's some uncertainty as to what people's motives are and I enjoyed that element a lot.The suspense continues to build throughout, as items start to disappear from the car and it feels threatening rather than accidental.Although there were some plot holes, and I wasn't sold on the ending, I did have fun reading it. I think if you don't take it too seriously, it's quite an enjoyable read.Thank you so much to the publisher, SourceBooks Fire, for providing me with a copy to read and review.Blizzard Scares are some of my favorite scares, so I am definitely happy that I had the opportunity to read this one. It's perfect for this time of year!!"
483,3.0,"Five things to know about Five Total Strangers:1. It takes place on Christmas Eve, should you be the sort of reader that likes to time books with the seasons. As a thriller, it’s a nice change of pace from Hallmark romances and classic holiday tales. 2. Though it’s a Young Adult book, the plot transcends YA since people of any age could find themselves in the characters’ situation - stranded while making a connecting flight and opting to rent a car with strangers heading to the same final destination. 3. The atmosphere is pretty great. You can almost hear the snow crunching under the tires as they wind their way through rural Pennsylvania during a blizzard. You may even feel the need to grab a blanket and a hot beverage while reading. 4. It’s told from the first person perspective of a teen girl, Mira, with occasional journal entries from another character mixed in. Mira isn’t a particularly dynamic or memorable character though, and needless to say many of her choices are questionable. 5. Suspension of belief is a must! There are too many coincidences and are-you-serious??? moments to elevate this much beyond a counter-programing option during the holiday season. 3.5 stars. "
484,2.0,"Unfortunately, this book was a young adult mix of No Exit and You, but done horribly. The characters in this book were super immature and just fought over everything. I was so tired of listening to arguments throughout the whole entire book. I didn't get attached to any characters and couldn't care less about the main character and her relationship with her mom. I wasn't even shocked at the ending, and wasn't thrilled at all.This book would be good for a young adult who is just getting into thrillers."
485,3.0,"2.5 stars rounded upListened to most of this on audio, the narrator is excellent at keeping the tension going and communicating Mira's voice. This is a fast-paced thriller, a quasi-locked room mystery because the five people are in a car together driving through a snowstorm. There are No Exit vibes here, but I didn't feel this one was quite as good. The entire build-up of the book was great. I felt the stress of the five people and got nervous for them as the book progressed. I was rooting for Mira to come out of this ok, to realize that her safety was more important than upsetting her mom. I literally couldn't put the book down, despite the problems I had with the narrative, it was really engrossing and exciting.However, there were a few shortcomings. First, there were way too many coincidences--seriously, would the father/son be able to actually find them and hunt them down? There was never anyone else around, and yet they seemed to be able to track the car just fine. (view spoiler)[Not to mention the man with the hat, I never got what that was all about, even in the end. Why was he there, how did he get around, what was his purpose in the story?  (hide spoiler)] Second, too many things did not make sense to me. So this group of people come into a bar and are frantic and scared, so the bar owner just closes up and goes home and leaves them there because it's Christmas Eve and it's closing time? No one thought to try to get them help, get them to a hotel, get them to a safe place to ride out the weather? No one wants to call their parents or other people in their lives to let them know they are all right? Despite these things, if you like a great YA thriller, this one is pretty decent. It has a stalker and so many secrets and hidden agendas. You definitely don't know who to trust until the very end.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own."
486,2.0,"2.5 StarsCW: (view spoiler)[Loss of loved one, stalker, car accidents in snowy weather. (hide spoiler)]Well that was somewhat of an abrupt and predictable ending. That being said I was still engaged and quite interested to see how the story would unfold. The characters were pretty flat but at least they weren't annoying. This book reminded me a bit of I Know What You Did Last Summer, which is another slightly underwhelming thriller. I think the author did a good job in terms of the pacing, and also sowing the seeds of doubt as to which of the passengers had sinister motives. I am glad I listened to it as I suspect the first quarter would make for dull reading. Just okay for me but I think it will be popular in the YA library I work at."
487,4.0,"Five Total Strangers by Natalie D. Richards is a young adult thriller read. Being the second book by Natalie D. Richards I have come to enjoy her action based thrillers but do not find them without a few flaws each time.In this book we meet eighteen year old, Mira, who has been living in California and wants to travel to spend the holidays with her mother in Pittsburgh on the east coast. Of course with Christmas holiday travel along the east coast you just may run into some delays with snow impacting the area and that is just what happens to Mira during her journey.Stuck in New York due to a snowstorm in the area Mira wants to find another way to get to her mother knowing that this holiday is going to be a tough one for her mother. Mira finds that the girl she had met on the plane is in the same situation and Harper plans to drive the rest of the way with her friends, Brecken, Josh and Kayla. While these strangers seem to know each other Mira can’t help but be a little wary of going but she doesn’t seem to have any other options.Five Total Strangers certainly is a parent’s nightmare, your teen to just hop into a car with people she doesn’t know with of course a snowstorm that “can’t be that bad”. As a reader it is obvious the storm would be that bad but I was still curious as to what else would go wrong for the young protagonist. In the end I did find that this one was one of those books that seemed a bit obvious to me leaving me to rate a little lower at three and half stars. However, loving an action packed escape I would read this author again in the future.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/"
488,1.0,"I was enjoying the writing at first and made it through about 40% when I realized NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. I was hoping for a twisty psychological thriller and got a REALLY long and dangerous car ride with a bunch of sketchy teens who argue the whole time and make terrible decisions, and also a really thin stalker plot. Predictable, annoying/flat characters. Not good."

 Happy publication day to this book! (The weather is much more caught-in-a-snowstorm appropriate now than when Sheena and I read this back in August 😂)
I’ve learned to pay attention when the hair at the back of my neck prickles—when a carnal, bone-deep instinct tells me something is wrong. And that’s what my instincts are saying now.
Five Total Strangers was a compulsively readable and quick read that immediately swept me into its story. While not necessarily complex, this didn’t fall into cliché, either; I’d heard good things about Natalie D. Richards’ writing, and after reading this book, I’m down to try more of her work.Stuck in the middle of a terrible blizzard, Mira Reynolds is desperate to make it home for Christmas—even if it means getting into a car full of complete strangers. Strangers who are just as desperate as she to be reunited with their families… except one. Turns out while everyone’s keeping secrets, there is one person hiding much, much more. Not only do the five of them have to contend with car accidents on icy roads and escaping from gun-toting gas station owners, someone in the car is acting with sinister motives. Things begin to go missing. Their snow chains and charging ports have been tampered with. Someone doesn’t want them to get home alive.◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️◻️I really think the author did a good job of weaving in other elements beyond just the mystery/thriller/survival-in-a-snowstorm plot. Mira grapples with immense grief for her aunt Phoebe’s death, a grief she’s suppressed for an entire year as her mother fell apart and Mira found herself having to be strong in her stead. At the same time, Mira’s just beginning to patch up a shattering friendship-breakup with her best friend, Zari, and the book also talks about Mira’s passion for art.I wish we’d learned more about each character, and that the culprit’s backstory was fleshed out more! I found it a little hard to picture each person in my head (apart from Harper, who’s East Asian, poised, and wealthy) because their initial descriptions were paltry, and eventually everyone’s histories are sketched in somewhat… except for the stalker’s. I also have mixed feelings about the letters from the stalker to Mira that are interspersed between chapters; on the one hand, I liked that they injected novelty into the narrative and revealed just how long he’s tracked her. On the other hand, they were so generic??? Very “we are meant to be together I just know it”? I guess I just felt it was a story I’d heard (many times) before. Finally, what cemented this as a three-star read for me was the fact that I found the ending somewhat rushed. I had to triple-check I hadn't missed a chapter or two at the conclusion because I felt like there were still plotlines to be revealed and character stories to be tied up; definitely didn't get a sense of closure with this one! 😭Nonetheless, there were some truly chilling moments (no pun intended). A burst of unexpectedly unsettling violence in a rest stop parking lot to keep you on your toes. A strange man who keeps showing up along their journey. And of course, the sabotage that seems to be happening under Mira’s nose. Buddy read with Sheena!! 💖💖Thanks to NetGalley and Sourcebooks Fire for this ARC in exchange for an honest review!"
491,2.0,"Had high hopes for this, but it fell really flat for me. I didn't gel well with the overwhelming amount of talk and description about the car journey in the beginning, and the characters arguing about which road to take, etc. The resolution felt a bit too obvious too. This book just did not work for me."
492,3.0,"I love cold weather/snowy suspense novels, so the cover of this book was screaming for me to read it. FIVE TOTAL STRANGERS is a locked-room-on-wheels YA thriller that left me with mixed feelings.The protagonist Mira is a high school student flying home to Pittsburgh to be with her mother on Christmas. A snow storm cancels connecting flights and leaves her stranded at the Philly airport. Desperate to get home, she makes the BAD decision of hitching a ride with four college-aged strangers who were on her flight. In a blizzard with strangers on desolate backroads? What's the worst that could happen? Mira is about to find out...First of all, I loved the creepy, frozen atmosphere the author created. As odd things start to happen, Mira becomes convinced that someone in their party doesn't want them to get home. But why? There were a lot of tense moments, and my thoughts on who was the bad one was constantly changing.Though the book kept me guessing, I thought the first half moved too slowly, and the ending was too abrupt. There were loose ends and unanswered questions that annoyed me, plus the reasoning behind the bad one's actions wasn't convincing, and also, what an absurd plan. You're in a blizzard!?!Overall though, I did enjoy the author's descriptive writing style, and I wouldn't hesitate to give her other books a try. Disclosure: I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
493,3.0,"After Mira's flight home gets cancelled on Christmas eve, she joins with 4 other college students to make the final leg to see her mother. Besides dealing with a record-breaking snowstorm and icy roads, other things start to happen. Will they be able to get home or is someone trying to sabotage their trip? The story is a closed-room mystery as you try to figure out which one of the five is trying to prevent them all from going home. Although the story is somewhat suspenseful, it still seemed to take forever to get to the point. It was a log of one icy road after another with some other areas of tension. I read this as part of the Big Library Reads on Libby. "
494,2.0,"If nothing else, this book was highly entertaining. I sat down and read it in one sitting and I couldn't keep turning the pages fast enough. But...I knew that the ending would make or break it. Unfortunately, it broke it.This is the kind of book where the more I thought about it, the more everything seemed to fall apart. At the end of the day, despite its pacing and despite how fast I devoured the book looking for answers, the answers themselves were lackluster, along with the characters. Other than the main character, Mira, none of the characters are really fleshed out. In fact, they're so one-dimensional that after the big reveal at the end...we don't even find out what really happens with the other characters? The things that were apparently driving them throughout the book don't matter as soon as we have the answer. The big reveal itself was...lacking. Not because it wasn't a big surprise, but because it wasn't really explored? We don't find out the motivations of the antagonist past something that was very surface-level. I also had to wonder what the antagonist's end goal was, because it wasn't really explained? I also found the little reveals throughout the book about different characters lackluster. Again, I think this was less to do with the reveals themselves and more to do with how they actually didn't do much to develop the characters or make us sympathise with them? It's like the reveals were there solely for shock value...and so they didn't even shock me because I didn't care about the characters enough. All in all, this was a very entertaining book, but so much stuff didn't really add up at the end. I was left with too many unanswered questions. All the characters, except for Mira, were underdeveloped. The book also ended quite abruptly. (view spoiler)[Some questions I was left with at the end of the book: why was Harper so worried about the police? Presumably if her father did commit fraud...the police already know? It didn't make much sense. Also we didn't even find out what happened with that at the end of the book, so what was the point? The same went for Brecken. How did things conclude with his family and him having to drop out of med school? Apparently, it doesn't matter! I also wondered about the man in the yellow hat. We didn't get any answers about him? It was far too big a coincidence that he kept showing up, and he asked the kids for a ride but had managed to show up to places they were at before they even got there?  (hide spoiler)]"
495,4.0,"3.5 starsFive Total Strangers started off strongly, kept me guessing and in suspense, surprised me a little, but was still a pretty good read overall. Mira Hayes, an 18-year-old art student, wants to visit her mother in PA for the holidays. But when her upcoming flight to PA is cancelled, she reluctantly accepts a ride home with four strangers from Harper, whom she met at the airport. And as Mira rides in the car with Kayla, Harper, Brecken, and Josh, she realizes that they're all hiding something. Soon, the ride goes from dangerous because of the upcoming blizzard, to terrifying as secrets become unfolded. Everyone's belongings are mysteriously disappearing. Someone in the car is clearly lying, and may even be sabotaging the trip—but why? And can Mira make it home alive, or will this nightmare drive turn fatal? 
My Thoughts
I don't know how to put this, but I expected more from this book. I wish that the characters had more dimension because that would have given the culprit more of a motive for their decision. But it also would have given us more reason to either name them as innocent or guilty. And I liked the plot overall, but there were some things I didn't like about the storytelling that narrated the story. I didn't particularly enjoy when certain events happened (view spoiler)[(like when they were in an accident, or when Josh was trying to control Mira) (hide spoiler)] and the events weren't described in full detail, so I was still left wondering ""what in the willy wonka happened?"". Even though I had a general idea of what might've happened, it would have been more enjoyable if the event was described in more detail so I could fully grasp the fictional situation. I liked how the book was fast-paced and that Mira actually had some common sense (unlike a lot of these other stupid thriller characters). The ending was alright, but it was pretty expected. Even then, there could have been an epilogue to end the story on a good note.Overall, this novel had me surprised and had unpredictable twists. The storytelling/narration wasn't great, but I dealt with it because I wanted to read a captivating story. I would definitely recommend this to someone who wants a kinda quick read that will slightly surprise them, but wouldn't leave them on a cliffhanger or wanting more."

497,4.0,"”Don’t worry. Destiny’s on our side.”Ok so essentially this is a read about five not so perfect strangers, who were stranded at an airport on Christmas Eve, and decided to brave the icy winter storm and drive 6 hours together to get home. They all desperately needed to get home for some reason or another.That being said. Things start going wrong, and they stay going wrong. Is their luck really this bad? Hmm. I don’t want to say too much, because I think the reason this book is so entertaining is because it is anxiety inducing and you just don’t know what is happening. This book had me stressed out the entire time just waiting for what would happen to these people next. I did not want to stop reading, it was that engrossing even though I was so anxious.I will say that there are a trunkful of loose ends at the end, and while I wish I had more answers, I understand that those answers weren’t the point of the story. All in all this was a great read, with great build. You can figure out what’s going on if you pay super close attention to details.AVAILABLE NOW!*ARC provided by SourceBooks Fire through NetGalley!"

While she gets to NY, her flight home is cancelled due to the weather. So she gets into a car with 5 people she doesn't know. I won't even count the one girl who she sat next to on the plane because talking to someone on the plane doesn't mean you know know them.While on this wild ass car trip to PA, shit hits the fan. Constantly. So many twists and turns. I honestly think that they shouldn't have gotten a car because they all suck at driving in a damn blizzard.

504,3.0,"FIVE TOTAL STRANGERS Natalie D. RichardsWhat did I think? What parent allows their teenage high school student this much freedom? In today's world, so many 20-year-olds don't drive and don't make the decisions that Mira (17 and in high school) was making. So suspend belief and click that seat belt. Mira is trying to get home for Christmas because her mother is alone as her sister, Mira's aunt, passed away the year before. Mira believes that she is responsible for her mother's well-being and has not acknowledged her personal grief, however, this is a secondary issue to the problems that Mira faces in that vehicle. The weather has forced Mira's plane to land and now she is catching a ride with total strangers (Parker, Kayla, Brecken, and Josh). This is when the snow really starts to fly. These guys are really not friends, and the friction starts. If planes don't fly, then you know that cars are having a hard time on the ground and by the time of the first pit stop, it is not going well... items such as wallets, cards, money start turning up missing... the phone chargers are not working, nobody has cell service. They make enemies because they drive off after they can't pay for the gas and things start sliding down an icy hill. Something in the car just doesn't sit right. I do want to point out that if you are in nowhere Pennsylvania out in a blizzard and involved in a wreck with someone you just ripped off and then ran over, don't go to a bar to get help. NOBODY at that bar cared and NO you can't use the phone! I mean really??? Then they toss them back out onto the parking lot in the snow? So back on the road and deeper in the blizzard, the party is falling apart and nobody knows who to trust. One great thing about this book was that while all of the characters were plopped into the book, they were well written at face value. I guess I am indicating that the characters didn't have to develop, they were strangers. Another thing I noticed is that you could almost hear the snow crack under the wheels of the car, it was very suffused with a hazy, atmospheric glow. But... all that said, it was a bit shy of reality and that hurt the story for me. 3.4 starsHappy Reading! "

SUMMARY
When Mira lands in Philadelphia for her layover, an incoming blizzard causes all outgoing flights to be cancelled. Desperate to get home to her mother for the holidays, she ends up accepting a ride from her glamorous seat-mate Harper who has rented a car with three other passengers. But the icy roads are getting deathly and personal belongings are disappearing. Mira begins to suspect that these strangers are hiding more than they let on, and that she may not make it home alive.
REVIEW
I love reading YA thrillers. But for every gem, there are a couple of rocks. This book was a rock. When it comes to YA thrillers, I am able to ignore some of the dumb decisions that are made. For example, a girl getting into a car with a bunch of strangers she met on the plane for a 6-hour road-trip. These dumb choices aren't the reason why I gave the book 2-stars. After the halfway-point, the plot really got out of hand. Why is that when you add a thriller to a road-trip the most obscene things happen? I can suspend my belief when reading suspense novels, but this one was too much. (view spoiler)[ They end up driving away from a gas-station without paying, and the guy chases after them in his car. But that isn't the end of it. 100 pages later, he turns up AGAIN and tries to kill them? Like. Sir. AND THEN INSTEAD THEY RUN OVER HIS SON AND DRIVE AWAY! It was at this point in the book that I decided it was 2-stars.  (hide spoiler)]We learn at the start that someone has been writing stalker letters to Mira ever since seeing her in the hospital cafeteria a year ago. These letters and items going missing from the car are the only ""thrilling"" aspects of the novel. The problem is that I didn't feel any suspense while reading this. A part of me wonders if I would've preferred listening to this instead of reading it. Maybe it would've been a three-star? I seem to enjoy thrillers/suspense a lot more audibly. TW: Cancer. Stalking."
506,4.0,"You know that feeling when you’re enjoying a book so much, you can’t put it down? Five Total Strangers gave me that feeling from the very beginning. Thank you to Sourcebooks Fire for providing me with this eARC in exchange for an honest review! When I say I love thriller books, this is the kind of book I’m talking about! Fast-paced, no-nonsense, creepy in all the right places, simple thrillers like this. This is exactly my kind of book. If you're looking for a Thriller to fly through in one weekend, I recommend you try out this book! For context, I don’t often feel this way. This is a special occurrence for me! However, whenever I can’t put a book down, it usually has a lot to do with personal preference – what I enjoy about a book rather than what makes it a good story in general. (I’m also the kind of person who enjoys a thriller simply because it “wasn’t too predictable”, so there’s that.)I was on the edge of my seat for most of this book. It was mostly well-paced, and I was genuinely curious about many aspects. I wanted Mira to get home to her mom. I wanted to figure out another mystery that I cannot tell you about because it’s not in the synopsis. I was desperate to know how everyone was going to survive! I flew through this book so fast, it got me out of a month-long reading slump! While the overall book kept me on the edge of my seat, the ending felt a bit… rushed. Everything happened so fast, and I didn’t have time to process it. This might have been something on my part, or it might have been an actual issue which was changed for the final draft. Although I liked this book a lot, I also felt like the characters could have been more developed and the ending could have been more developed. For this reason, I’m putting 4 points under my “personal emotions” rating system category, for liking this book even though I normally would have taken more points off. Either way, this book was exactly what I needed in my life during this spooky season, so I was really caught up in the moment while reading it! It was a fun and fast thriller, perfect for this time of the year. Rating System Character like-ability: 3.5Character development: 3Plot development: 3Writing style: 3.5Dialogue: 3.5Personal emotions: 43.41 ≈ 3.5 stars. This is a solid 3.5, but because I have to round it, it will be 4 stars for this review."
507,4.0,"Twisty, fun thriller!I enjoyed the premise of this, how the five came together on this dangerous road trip and the way everyone seemed like a suspect. It was difficult to tell if there was one crazy person or if the whole car was in on it. The pacing was good and I liked how things escalated and you never knew what exactly was happening. Mira getting in the car wasn't a good idea from the beginning, but it was plausible that she felt like she needed to get home and took this opportunity even if it was sketchy. The way things were orchestrated had me focusing on one specific character for the majority of the book, but I was way off. There were a couple things that weren't explained at the end and I think they were too odd to be coincidental. "
508,5.0,"This is a slow-burn psychological thriller that kept me enraptured from cover to cover. There is no prologue with a gritty murder to open this book. In fact, it all starts out fairly normal, yet the words and events still carry a sharp edge to them. We first meet Mira when she's on a plane on Christmas Eve during a blizzard. The plane hits turbulence, and the stress that Mira feels about this, despite being a frequent flyer, nearly oozes off the pages. A lot of the creepy things that happen in the early pages of this book are easily explained away. I love how Mira questions her paranoia and isn't sure if anything malicious is actually going on.  The four strangers that she's traveling with are all ""normal"" at a surface level, but there are little unsettling quirks and unlikeable personality characteristics that make themselves known the longer they travel together.  Harper seems to have two different personalities that don't quite mesh.  Brecken seems like a nice pre-med student, yet he says several misogynistic things that bring his ""niceness"" into question.  Josh also comes across as kind, but he can be condescending and pushy.  Kayla is the quiet one in the group, and she is sleeping far too much.  They all have their secrets, even Mira, who's pretending to be a college student out of fear that they wouldn't let her tag along if she told them she was still in high school. Throughout the novel, we're made privy to the content of letters to Mira that were mailed to her over the last year.  Last year Mira's Aunt Phoebe died after a long battle with cancer, and when she was in the hospital, a kind stranger bought her a coffee. While it's obvious that Mira doesn't remember this stranger, the stranger remembers her. These letters detail this stranger's growing obsession with her, and it quickly becomes clear that they've found her. They're one of the four strangers she's travelling with--but which one? While the events escalate quite gradually, the book is far from boring. Every little possibly innocuous thing that goes wrong seems suspicious.  Not only is one of the strangers potentially dangerous, but they're also battling the elements and other unpredictable obstacles in their journey home.  I did notice that the group tended to have long, drawn out conversations while outside the car a few too many times. Maybe blizzards are different in the US than in Canada (I mean, I'm sure they are), but I was expecting the snow and ice that was causing thirty-car pileups on the highway to be a deterrent for standing outside and chatting. That said, emotions were running high, and if they're afraid to get back into the car with strangers, maybe a little frostbite is preferrable to being shanked by a new ""friend"". Aside from this little criticism, the events of this book are quite plausible, making this into one of the more realistic psychological thrillers that I've read in a while.I recommend this book to anyone looking for an intense slow-burn thriller featuring suspicious characters, questionable choices, and unpredictable weather. *Thank you to Sourcebooks Fire and Netgalley for the ebook to review*<This review appeared first on https://powerlibrarian.wordpress.com/ Instagram | Blog | Website | Twitter My 2020 Reading Challenge"
509,3.0,"This book was a fun locked room style mystery. It reminded me of a less gruesome No Exit- very chilling and atmospheric. The story was about Mira, a girl who needs to get home for Christmas. When all flights are cancelled, she grabs a ride with her seatmate from her first flight and a group of other stranded passengers going to Pennsylvania. Soon after they leave, things start to disappear, and Mira realizes that everyone is hiding something. Thoughts: This story is basically a locked room mystery, with Mira and four others trapped in a car in a snowstorm. I have been trying to give YA more of a chance, but to be honest it all just seems kind of petty and repetitive. There was a great mystery here, but it was too drawn out and I just wanted to get to the good parts! There were a few good twists, but a lot of repetitive down time. There were some super spooky parts, but there were also things that were unexplained or illogical. It was your basic YA mystery, but for all the great buildup, there wasn’t much of an ending. If you like YA, this one is probably for you. If you don’t like a lot of coincidences in the way of explanation, maybe not. 3-stars. "
510,1.0,None of this makes any sense and it is intensely stupid.
511,4.0,"3.5 StarsI just finished listening to this on audio. I really enjoyed the narrator and felt she did a good job on this one. The book is about 4 strangers who are forced to ride together through the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania during a snow storm after their flights are cancelled. It is Christmas Eve and everyone is eager enough to get home that they are willing to risk the dangerous drive. From the beginning you get the feeling that something isn't quite right. The main character Mira gets an ominous feeling but can't quite pin point it. The Pros: -The author did a great job of making this atmospheric. I grew up in Central NY and the descriptions of the weather conditions, driving, and overall landscape descriptions were spot on. I could vividly picture myself in that environment. -The author also did a great job of building the characters. I felt like I could really picture each individual character and could hear their voices and each personality seemed so realistic. -They also did a great job of making you think that any person in the story could be the ""bad guy."" Just when I thought I could pin point it I would be questioning everything again. The Cons:-The speed. The beginning/middle felt like it was dragging and though this could have been part of the purpose because the characters were literally inching along in a car at 20 mph... It still felt like it was a slower build than I would have liked. Then the end felt too abrupt. The author kept you barely hanging on and then just when it got good Bam! it was over. -Some of the scenarios just seemed far fetched and unrealistic. I won't describe them as to avoid spoilers but there was some serious eye rolls on my part. Overall, I thought this was a decent atmospheric read that is good for the upcoming winter months. It reminded me of a mash up between No Exit and You! You have a little stranger danger, stalkers, snow, and seclusion. The perfect making of a good atmospheric mystery. "

Little does she know when accepting a ride with 4 total strangers in the midst of a blizzard that one of them is a sociopath with a deadly obsession. Can she uncover the truth before the road trip turns fatal? ⁣⁣This is a YA locked room type mystery taking place in a car during a blizzard. It was a binge worthy read that had me second guessing all the inhabitants of the car and mentally spinning all types of theories. ⁣⁣While I felt annoyed with some of the characters and their choices, I also found myself wanting to scream at Mira because I sensed danger at every turn. I was completely addicted to the story and engrossed in all the danger and mishaps along the way. The suspense builds throughout the story and though it wasn’t without a few plot holes, this one made me jump, shout OMG a few times and kept me on the edge of my seat. So, I’m rating it based on all the feels it gave me bc it was a perfect snowy mystery for this time of year and I thoroughly enjoyed getting lost in it. ⁣⁣"
513,4.0,"This road trip is like a living nightmare. I found myself racing through the chapters to discover the identity of the passenger in the car who had been writing to Mira. Many factors ratchet up the peril including the horrible weather, seeming sabotage of the safety kit, key items going missing, and the paranoia that develops. They reach a point where the narrative turns on a dime. Any one of them, even Mira, seems a potential suspect. Quite well done and I will most certainly check out one of Ms. Richards' other titles. Excuse me now while I grab a blanket and some hot cocoa. Reading this book made me feel like I was stranded out in the cold with them."
514,1.0,dnf @ page 116this just ain’t it. the mc is infuriatingly thick and doesn’t have a personality. the other characters are various levels of annoying. i’m just so bored. do not recommend.
515,4.0, Wow couldn’t put this down. The ending felt a tad rushed but still really enjoyed this adventure. I’m not a big YA reader but glad this was a buddy read pick. Thanks to those who suggested it.
516,1.0,"I wrote my original review a while ago, but now that I’ve had time to think about it, I really didn’t like this book. This book follows Mira, a girl who lives in California with her father and is trying to visit her mother in Pennsylvania for Christmas. She gets grounded at an airport but a generous stranger asks if she wants to hitch a ride with her and three other strangers. From the beginning, Mira knows that something is wrong, but she can’t tell exactly what. I knew who the bad guy the entire time. From the page that they were introduced, I knew who it was. It made me feel really smart at the time, but looking I know that you don’t want to know who it is in the first fifty or so pages. I didn’t like any of the characters. There was absolutely no character development in any of them and it was super annoying reading about how she just needs to get home so she can feel safe. If you don’t feel safe with these people, then why are you still riding with them! Get out! Ask them to drop you off at a gas station or hotel. Getting home was her only goal, and she didn’t even think about how riding across the state with a whole ton of strangers might make it so she never goes home again! The girl who asked her to go with her, Harper, why would she ask so many people who she doesn’t know to go with her if she just wants it to be a smooth journey back home. She was kind of setting them all up for disaster. I understand why she had Brecken go, she didn’t really have a choice with that one, but why everyone else? Not safe, not smart. I do not remember what Brecken’s motives were to be in that car. I remember he thought Josh was crazy (which good job to him for being the only person in this book with a functioning brain) and he hit Josh with a shovel or something because he saw the letters he wrote. And he helped pay for the car, other than that, I can’t remember a thing about him.Kayla, I don’t really see a point in Kayla’s character. Like I remember that she stole everything and she helped Josh lure Mira for drugs, but really, what was the point of her? Josh could’ve been the bad guy all alone. I think she was just there to make us as readers more confused, but that didn’t even work.Josh just annoyed me the entire book. He nice now, but wait now he’s mean, but he has a broken leg so I need to be nicer to him, NO. He’s just a creepy stalker who I saw was creepy from “He’s smiling like he already knows,” on page 26. Umm, creepy anyone? And why did he have to kill that boy by running him over? Not necessary. Just try to work for the gas you stole, or next time, don’t let the driver drive away with gas you haven’t paid for from the guy who has a sign that says he’ll shoot you if you’re stealing! Oh yeah, that’s another thing I remember about Brecken, he thought it was a good idea to steal the gas. And don’t even get me started about the guy with the baseball cap! Why was he everywhere they went! It literally makes no sense! He should not have been a character in this book, let alone an important one! The author could’ve just had someone driving by the pick them up, but no, it had to be the freaky guy they saw at like three different places who was really a really nice guy who just wanted a ride. WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF HIM?! I deeply dislike this book."
517,3.0,"In order to get home to Pittsburgh in time for Christmas, Mira hitches a ride home from the airport with four college students. While trying to outrun an oncoming snowstorm, road conditions become treacherous. However, the icy roads are not the only danger in sight. When items seem to go missing, fingers point at all of the passengers. Is someone purposely trying to prevent them from getting home? Should Mira trust these strangers?I usually veer away from YA books, but this one caught my eye. I also read some reviews that said it wasn’t the typical YA thriller and decided listen to the audiobook. While the narrator was excellent, I felt that the story was more predictable than I would have liked and didn’t really rely on a substantial premise. Initially, I was intrigued as the story built up steam, but my interest gradually fizzled as not a lot happened. I longed for more twists and ultimately figured out the ending way too soon. Also, the man in the yellow hat? I couldn’t take him seriously as a sinister character, because I just kept thinking of Curious George. Overall, this turned out to be exactly what it was, a YA thriller. 3/5 stars"
518,3.0,"When it's rainy and cold outside, there's nothing I love more than curling up under the blankets with a good thriller. There's just something about thrillers when it's storming that just really sucks you in. While this one wasn't amazing, it was still pretty fun and kept me guessing until the very end. When a snowstorm grounds Mira's flight connection, she makes a spur of the moment decision to share a car with her seatmate, Harper, from the flight. It seems pretty safe, Harper seems like a sweet girl and with the addition of her friends, there's safety in numbers right? Except not too far into their trip, Mira realizes that these ""friends"" have never met before today. They're all strangers and they all seem to have secrets. Then weird things start happening that seem to delay their trip - are they just accidents or is someone sabotaging them?This had an interesting cast of characters. I liked Mira for the most part, she was smart and knew to trust her instincts. Not always of course, otherwise there wouldn't be a story. But I spent most of the book like Mira, running through this cast of characters to try to figure out who was behind everything. I pretty much had made a case for each person so I wasn't disappointed or shocked when the truth came to light. Overall, a fun and fast read. "
519,4.0,"3 1/2 Stars“Five total strangers” what is the big library read for this month. I thought the plot lines were very well done, with tremendous potential. However, at times it’s sort of got lost on it self. Five strangers leaving the airport trying to get home and are caught in a disastrous blizzard.Overall it was a really good book and fun to read. However it was not really great!I recommend"
520,1.0,"This is seriously the book they picked for the Big Library Read (or whatever it's called)? This ... monstrosity?Let's be clear here. I don't like this author's work. I've read 3 of her books now and I hate them all for the same reason. A nearly falling asleep plot for the first 80 or so percent then you slam into warp drive and 'solve' everything with a bunch of convenient excuses. I only read this because of the Library Read thing (and honestly I knew it was a mistake).Is it my fault for read this? Knowing I'd be disappointed? Yes. But I had to know just how bad it was.First of all, I'm pretty sure this story got pulled from 1995 and plopped down into 2020. 5 'young people' all traveling and only one brings their laptop with them? Sure. Okay. That's totally believable. All the try hard sexist comments felt sprinkled in so that we could have a girl power moment. They were cringy at best.The idea that 5 people all just happened to be flying out of San Diego to end up in Pittsburgh. By layove in New Jersey? On what continent does that even make sense? Crazy stalker, sure, he wanted to be sure to be on the same flight as Mira, but everyone else? Everyone else just decided to bypass all the NORMAL flights and take a weird-as-F plane change in Newark, New Jersey. I'm not even sure how you find a flight like that? Like, was the research on google something like 'the most ridiculous way to fly from San Diego to Pittsburgh known to man'. Because I honestly have no idea how that flight ended up happening.Continuing on with the idea that 5 random strangers all just happened to be on the same flight, and all had the same connecting flight (you would assume since they were all in the same car driving towards Pittsburgh). Laughable at best. Come on. And why didn't anyone ever QUESTION the purely conincidental circumstances that led them to all booking the stupidest flight possible to get where they all needed to go on Christmas eve?The subplots were a joke. I'm pretty sure you could have come up with something more convincing writing a bunch of things on a dart board and throwing a dart than what happened in this book.THERE ARE SPOILERS TO FOLLOW. THEY WILL NOT BE MARKED.**********The yellow hat dude. I'm sorry. These idiots had no idea where they were going. Got lost mutiple times. Even doubled back along an old route and this random dude JUST HAPPENED TO BE IN ALL THOSE PLACES TOO? No. That's not how it works. That's not how any of this works. They go off on some random side road that no one has any business driving on AND YELLOW HAT DUDE FINDS THEM THERE? On Christmas Day? No. Absolutely not.The gas station scene. I've never in my entire life rolled my eyes as much as I did as this whole disaster played out. First of all. Did they not to think to ask ANYONE at the gas station for money? They talked about all the people stranded there, but then I guess those people just vanished?Second. They drove for awhile, then doubled back, ended up somewhere completely unexpected and that's where gas station man found them? I'm sorry. No one is going to drive around town for hours looking for some idiot kids who stold $40 worth of gas. It's absolutely not worth anyone's time. And especially not in a freaking blizzard.Third. The major car accident scene. I. Just. The non-chalance in which they drive away, not concerned about anyone else. Brushing off the idea that there's nothing they could have done to help. Okay. Sure. Whatever.Fourth. The stuff disappering. I'm honestly not sure how that was supposed to work out. I'm not going to back to read any of this again, but it never felt like ANYONE had enough time to not only steal something but then plant it in someone else's stuff.Fifth. The idea that no one could hear anyone else talking. Ever. People have full-fledged conversation at the back of th SUV with the hatch open and NO ONE hears anything? Please. Everyone whispering around and keeping secrets. It was all so stupid and dramatic.Sixth. Everyone's backstories were pathetic. A druggie (supposedly). A precious little rich girl. A pretentious rich boy. And a stalker. Cool. Cool. Cool. Throw a few generic descriptions at them, a sob story or two and we're done here folks. No further character development needed.Ugh. I honestly don't even know what to say. To be competely upfront, I read spoilers about this book before I read it. I knew it was going to be terrible. I knew who the stalker was the whole time. At one point I desperately hoped I was wrong (and so did the book) but of course, no. You get the most obvious person (even had I not read spoilers it was pretty clear who the stalker was early on - and no I'm not saying that to pretend I'm smart. The book is pretty heavy handed with everyone, except one characters).Here's how it would have been better. (Aside from scrapping the whole project)Cut all the gas station hijinks and the crap about the guy in the ball cap.Create some actual tension between the characters. Maybe someone does resort to violence in their desperation to get home. Cut all the weird creepy stalker stuff (the letters were sooooooooo stupid). Make the stalker show a genuine interest in Mira. Gaslight her a bit when she starts to question things. Have everyone be a bit on edge from the start.Make Mira's connection with her parents actually mean something. She might as well have been calling the info number for the local time and weather for as much emotions as there was from her parents. Give Mira a REAL reason to need to get home. A reason she had to book as last minute Christmas Ever trip. Her aunt is in the hospital NOW and she wants to be there in time to say good bye. All the whining and moaning about the dead aunt and her weak mom just made Mira sound childish.Have more opportunties for the strangers to connect. Maybe they get stuck in the traffic at first. They talk. Share things. Now I'm invested becuse these people seem real. I never cared about Harper's dad getting busted for illegal business practices. I couldn't care less about what's his name failing his stupid classes. The other girl being a druggy. It was all so shallow and pathetic. Josh had absolutely no personality outside of 'I like to read thick books'.Get rid of all the weird Boomer humor. The druggy girl (I literally just finished reading this book and can't remember half their names) kept attacking Harper and rich dude and criticizing them for not having cash becuse they wore nice clothes. Because that makes sense. It's 2020 (when this was published) not 1990. Not having cash is normal for a lot of people (most people, I'd assume). There were weird phrases and incompetent actions. Harper didn't know how to clear the ice off her windshield (playing into the whole you kids these days are useless/helpless vibe or most of the book). The idea that 5 stupid kids would all willingly get into a car with strangers was the most annoying part of all of this.I'm sorry, I'm off on a tangent. Forget about making this better. HOW THE F*CK did stalker boy know Mira would be on THAT flight at THAT time? There is no way in heck he would have known that. And if he did, I need to know HOW? Because if Mira's posting her travel plans on social media for the whole world to see she deserved to be stalked (I'M JOKING - but she needs a lesson not being an idiot online). How did this dumb stalker plan any of this? Did he just magically know they'd all end up in the same car? Where did he hide those dumb letters? They all searched thorough everyone else's luggage before the letters showed up. Where had he hid the stuff before that? (Yeah, there was that stupid scene where he 'dropped' his wallet, but please, don't tell me had was hiding stuff under the SUV the whole time). There is no way that he could have planned all that stuff out so well not knowing how things actually played out. What if Mira had stayed at the airport? What if her Mom drove to get her? Was he going to kidnap her from the airport with thousands of random people watching?And how convenient that the stalker ends up dead so the actual reasons don't have to be explained. We'll never actually know how he planned everything or who was really responsible for the gas station incidents (the stealing and the running over).There were some good moments here. The writing (when it was ad nauseum about poor Mira's mom) was terrible. The scene where they're almost in the car accident was written with tension (for the most part). The basic premise isn't even awful (just badly executed). But honestly, this was a mess. The more you think about it the less everything makes sense.Like the pills the druggy girl was taking. Why was she so surprised about who had taken her pills when Mira tells us that that stalker must have been giving her a few at a time to make her compliant to his plans (if that's what really happened why her outrage about him being the one who stole them???).I honestly think this would have been so much better had Mira just been gaslighted to heck and back by everyone. Stalker could have kept taking her things. She makes a scene. They search the car. Look, Mira it's right here. You're paranoid. Everyone would buy into her being a bit scattered. She would start to question everything. It would have been better than randomly stealing everyone stuff hiding in some random place and then magically sneaking it into her bag later.Okay. I don't want to think about this any more. The book was bad. The characers were flat. The plot was FAR to convenient. I'm disappointed."
521,5.0,"“Our stuff isn’t going missing – someone is stealing it. And there are exactly four people who could be responsible. I take a sharp breath and look at my fellow travelers with new wariness. Someone in this car is lying.”Thank you, SourceBooks Fire, for a finished copy in exchange for an honest review.Five Total Strangers is one of those books you legitimately can’t stop reading. I could not put this down and ending up reading it entirely in one sitting. It was a phenomenal thriller; I mean it had everything. The edge of your seat thrills, the paranoia, the twists, and it was action packed. I loved this book and honestly it is up there for best thrillers I have ever read.We are following Mira, who is heading home for Christmas to be with her mom in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It’s Christmas Eve and the airport Mira is at is basically stopping all flights because a blizzard is coming in. Her seat mate from the first flight has to get home to her family as well and rents a car. Even though they don’t know each other, Harper, offers to give her a ride home with her three other friends. Mira takes up the offer and they start out on their 6-hour drive to Pittsburgh. Obviously, things don’t go as planned, for one they are driving in a blizzard. Two, who exactly are these mysterious people riding in the car with Mira? I was seriously biting my nails while reading this book, my heart rate was through the roof. I could not take my eyes off of this book, I was flipping the pages so fast because it wasn’t only action packed, but had so many twists and turns.I live where this story takes place and it made me so uneasy reading this because the blizzards that hit Pennsylvania are like no other sometimes. The highway they are taking to get home, is quite literally the worst highway and everyone around here knows not to use it in the winter. I think reading this was actually quite scary because it was very realistic and it just freaked me out. Not to mention the ending was exceptional. I did not see it coming and was blown away, the author led me down a whole other path that I never even suspected what happened. I love when authors take the time and write out believable endings, and knowing what the ending is, I can say if I went back and reread this book, I could totally see the little hints and easter eggs the author left. Five Total Strangers is now going to be the book I recommend to everyone and anyone who wants a top-notch thriller."
522,3.0,"This YA thriller is a solid 3 stars. The moment I picked it up, I couldn’t put it down. Resulting in me finishing the book in one sitting. Which is not something I can complain about. I love it when a book captivates my attention so hard that I MUST keep reading. The idea of this book, girl gets in a car with a bunch of strangers was such a great plot. Desperate to get home makes for a thrilling tale. And the concept that we know more than the characters is one of my favorite tropes. The problem that I usually find with thrillers is that they are predictable. Five Total Strangers was no exception. It became obvious where the storyline was going early on. But I must admit I was pleasantly surprised to discover the letters that were being written. That I did not see coming.The characters were great, Mira was pretty straight forward and I like that she wasn’t a doormat in such an intense situation. I think I would have crawled up into a ball the entire trip and had a million panic attacks. But Mira called out people on their crap and voiced her opinions out loud which I appreciated. I also liked Harper! She was very talkative so it was nice to see them all get along even if it was for a short period.Overall, this book was great. If you enjoy a good thriller then definitely give this one a go. It’s easy to guess where the story is going, but it catches your attention from the get-go. Five Total Strangers is suspenseful and satisfying. "
523,3.0,"Actual Rating 3.5I am a sucker for YA mysteries, this book was on my tbr for months. Read the synopsis and tell me you are not sold by it.Mira wants to spend Christmas at her home with her mother as it is also the death anniversary of her aunt- her mother’s twins. But nature got different plans for her. She doesn’t have another option except for taking a car with 4 other strangers in this heavy storm.I love the world-building, the way the author explained it, It was so easy for me to imagine myself with them in that car. The character building was also quite interesting, how they were from different backgrounds and the way their character unfolded while travelling for hours. The way the author tried to divert attention to different people also grabbed my attention. But the problem was pace, it felt unnecessary dragged, I wish it wasn’t that stretched and we get to know a little more detail in the ending."
524,4.0,"4.75 stars - my star rating is taking in to account that this is a YA book. I really enjoyed this book so much. We don’t get a ton of detail or back story, but there’s enough that it kept me turning the pages because I couldn’t wait to see what was going to happen. These kids are traveling in the middle of a historical snow storm. I am terrified of traveling on large highways and add snow, it’s an absolute no for me. Maybe that’s why this book kept me on the edge of my seat, it contains some of my great fears! Some things that happen are a bit too convenient, but this is YA remember. Perfect read for the time of year since this takes place at Christmas. "
525,1.0,Boring and bad
526,3.0,"3.5/5This was a pretty exciting read. With an interesting start, and some choice twists and turns in the story, it kept me fairly hooked till the end - even if to prove to myself that I was right about who was the antagonist in the story. The main protagonist, Mira, makes some seriously debatable decisions while being locked in a car with people she doesn't know. She lies to her parents about hitching a ride with random teens, doesn't return their calls or texts to prevent them from worrying, and continuously believes the wrong person in any argument. Despite that, you want her to get home safe. And you cannot wait to see what happens next as this weird group of young adults find themselves running into crazy situations in a snowstorm. The setting of the snowstorm is intense and gripping, and makes you feel like you're right alongside them in the car. There are a few questions that are left unanswered after a quite abrupt ending, and you'll be left wishing you'd get closure on those fronts. Needless to say, if there is one thing this book will achieve, it will be to scare you off from ever accepting rides or gifts from strangers ever again. No matter how nice they seem. "
527,4.0,"This was a very good book! It’s thrilling and suspenseful! FIVE TOTAL STRANGERS is a holiday getaway to murder read! Mira Hayes has been living in San Diego with her dad while attending a art school. It’s Christmas Eve, and all she wants to do is get home to Pittsburgh and her mom. But a blizzard ruins her plans. During a layover in Newark airport, Mira learns that every flight out has been canceled. Luckily, Mira’s seat mate Harper offers her a ride in her rental car along with three other stranded passengers: Brecken, Kayla, and Josh. Accepting a ride with strangers usually isn’t her thing, but she’s desperate to get home. However, snarled traffic forces them to resort to risky side routes. Mira feels like she’s being watched, and the group’s belongings keep disappearing. As their situation becomes more dire they make reckless decisions, and Mira thinks one of the strangers are a suspect and a stalker. This was book was excellent, keeping every page turned, but there was some parts that had me annoyed such as the constant “too much dialogue” arguing between the characters. Other than that, is was a great book to read!!"
528,3.0,"Natalie D. Richards provides a fast, high-intensity page-turner in ‘Five Total Strangers’. Most appropriate for the YA reader, and all age groups should find this an exciting adventure for the five people who come together because all are stranded in an airport during a blizzard while trying to get home for Christmas break. They all pile into a rented car hoping to make their way home by the next ( Christmas ) day to be with their respective families. The horror that ensues is like nothing “four” them could have imagined. I only gave this one three stars because I figured out relatively early on who the “bad” passenger is and would have appreciated it more if it was a bit harder to deduce.Definitely a lot of surprises, with many hardships and wrenches thrown in throughout. A most resilient group of young people, to say the least."
529,4.0," FIVE TOTAL STRANGERS was a cold and atmospheric twisty thriller that kept me guessing until the very end. Where I was of course proved wrong because this book refused to let me be right. It’s never a good idea to get in a car with strangers, but that’s exactly what Mira does when all flights are cancelled on her way home to Pittsburgh. Choosing to tag along in a rental car paid for by her seat mate Harper, she and 4 others brave the long drive and get stuck in a blizzard. As if things couldn’t possibly get worse, weird things begin to happen and everyone in the car is a suspect. Fast-paced and filled with plenty of twists and turns, Richards does a great job of redirecting focus when you think you may have figured something out. Much like their journey home, there are plenty of stumbling blocks that get in the way of you potentially solving the mystery. With dynamic characters with interesting and shadowy backstories, it’s anyone guess who has sinister intentions. 3.5 stars to this quick and tense thriller. *arc received courtesy of the publisher. "
530,4.0,"Mira accepts a ride from her airplane seat mate, Harper, when their connecting flight is cancelled due to the weather. Harper rents an SUV and invites 3 others to come along as well. But the weather keeps getting worse and worse as they attempt to drive from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. As the weather worsens, the 5 strangers encounter a nightmare of a storm and each other.This was an interesting read for me as I’ve made a similar drive at Christmas through Pennsylvania during a storm. Luckily I wasn’t with strangers and we made it there safely, but this story brought back some scary memories of hunkering down in the back seat trying not to freak out at the weather.This book was definitely an addictive and quick read. I’ll have to check out more from this author."
531,4.0,"I honestly don't understand the bad reviews on this one. I sat at the edge of my seat for the ENTIRE book. I usually read before bedtime, and let me tell you that it was a BAD idea with this one... I was so stressed I needed to cool down before going to sleep🤣 Even if I did predict who was responsible, I was stunned that I had it right. I really enjoyed this really eventful ride with these 5 total strangers.Many thanks to SourcebooksFIRE for the complimentary e-copy of this book through NetGalley. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own. "
532,4.0,3.5 starsThis one kept me guessing until almost the very end. Wondering what each character was hiding was the best part.The right amounts of eerie were added in throughout.I enjoyed the read overall.
533,2.0,"This story just didn't work for me. All those different stops and turns, etc., really very little problems driving in the snow. Dangers were almost all from other drivers. Only problems with iced up wipers near the beginning? Following google maps when they're far off the beaten path? Roaring off from a complete stop on snow and ice?  Mira: ""I pitch forward, knees hitting the snow and my body slamming after. I'm falling, my shoulders crumpling under as my body rolls over and down....I stop with a jolt...my head facing downhill. I ease myself over to all fours with a groan, snow soaking through my jeans and gloves.""  Hold it right there! After all the stops they've made and exposure to the elements, she's just now getting her JEANS soaked!?! None of them is dressed properly!It just didn't seem realistic--I know what it's like to be traveling by car during heavy snow and occasional snow-storm. I know how difficult-to-impossible it can be to extricate a car from snow when all four wheels are not on the same plane. I also know how quickly one can get cold and miserable even with winter clothing. My winter experience has been in the Western USA, but I can't imagine their trip from Newark to Pennsylvania would have been so easy.The events and details simply weren't plausible to me. (This book, a YALSA's Teen' Top Ten Nominee (20121), is also a current Libby November 2021 ""Big Library Read"" selection.)"

537,2.0,"2.5 stars!Mira is travelling home for Christmas across the country. When she lands in, her connecting flight is cancelled due to an intense blizzard that is rapidly approaching. She runs into her seatmate from her flight, Harper, who has managed to find a rental SUV. When Harper offers Mira a ride, she can’t turn her down as she is feeling a lot of pressure to get home to her grieving mother. Mira finds out that Harper has invited three other strangers to join them and becomes uneasy but she doesn’t see any other choice. On her journey home, their situation becomes increasingly worse as the storm settles in.@sourcebooksfire sent me this ARC and I am so grateful! I always love the chance to read on paper instead of digitally. Unfortunately, this was just not an enjoyable read for me. I found Mira to be annoying as there is a lot of time spent exploring her anxiety around the decisions she’s made and not a lot of common sense. She repeatedly chooses not to contact her parents when she is in an obviously perilous situation. I did really like Richards’ depiction of grief and how it can impact people differently as Mira’s aunt passed away last year and her family is still trying to recover. There wasn’t anything that I didn’t guess - I thought the story was missing some red herrings. I am thinking I have been very spoiled for YA thrillers after reading Karen McManus’ books - she is a tough act to follow. Overall, an easy read with a few moments of tension."
539,1.0,I guess this book was not for me. There was creepy scenes in the story (the guy with the yellow hat) that did not make sense being that creepy in the end. It really had nothing to do with the book. A lot of pointless arguments that did not go anywhere.
540,2.0,Reading the synopsis of this book I thought it was be just the sort of thriller/mystery I was looking for. Sadly this book just didn't pull me in. The characters just fell a bit flat for me and when I finished the book I only had more questions.
541,4.0,A fast-paced YA read that plunges you into a road trip with strangers in the middle of a snowstorm. No one is as they seem and everyone is under suspicion. Recommended if you're in the mood for a quick thriller.
542,1.0,"Oh my god, so bad. "
543,5.0,"Hello!I really think when I do my monthly wrap up , I am going to be hitting a personal record (which for the last month of the year) will be really cool! Recently, I noticed I had a bunch of borrows left on my Hoopla account, so I borrowed a bunch of graphic novels (including the last Giant Days, the one that is like a year later, but honestly I do not know if I am ready for that, like emotionally to say goodbye to these amazing characters) but I also borrowed some audio books. I knew I still had a bunch to do this month, in the way of work and getting ready for the holidays (wrapping gifts, mailing things, decorating, etc..) so audio books are perfect for all of that. One of the audio books I listened to (in nearly a day, I finished all but one hour of the book) was Five Total Strangers, I was addicted to this book, I needed to know what was going to happen next, I could not put it down.SPOILERS AHEADMira, is flying home for Christmas but during one leg of her flight the weather gets way to frightful outside and the plane experiences some turbulence. After they are safely on the ground and inside the airport, Mira learns that all the planes are grounded and she will not be making it home for Christmas. Mira, is worried but not in panic mode yet, as she is waiting in a line, the girl who was sitting near her on the plane offers to give her a ride home (even though it’s hours away), she tells Mira, she is going to rent a car and drive! Mira, declines at first but when she gets on the phone with her step-dad she learns that her mother and step-dad have separated and she knows she needs to be there for her mother. Mira, rushes to find this new ride home, and luckily catches the ride however, its not going to be just Mira and her plane friend. Its going to be five people, five people she has never met, but as long as she gets home things will be okay. But once the group gets out the road things are dicey, the snow is worse then they thought and there are accidents everywhere, its going to be a very long drive and Mira is not entirely sure everyone in her new travel group is here just to get home.I was riveted by this book. At first I was honestly a little unsure but things picked up so quickly and we were in the thick of things before I knew it. Mira, was in the car, and the weather was crazy and the people seemed to have no idea of who the other was but they all agreed to get in the car with one another for different reasons (and it was wild). I honestly, never expected the twisty part of this story and I kept shouting out loud who I thought it was and I was always wrong (I got it right once but I immediately changed my answer because for some reason I was like noooo that is so not right). I absolutely enjoyed my time with this book! I know there is another thriller book about a long winter drive and now I really want to pick that one up as well (so if you know the title to that one please tell me, I have been unable to find it again since I read this book)! If you have Hoopla and are able to definitely give this a try, or just put it on your TBR cause it is a wild ride!Goodreads Rating: 5 Stars***Thank you so much to the publisher for the E-ARC on Netgalley in exchange for an honest review"
544,3.0,"Notes:Yay for libraries!Leaving at 3 stars for good narration. If I had to read the book, I wouldn't have made it to the end. 2 Stars for StoryOkay, on my Overdrive app for electronic library loans, there was a post for the month's Big Library Read. This was it. I'm currently on a mystery/thriller kick and got the book. Devon Sorvari was a great narrator! I'll keep an eye out of her work and give them a try.The story? Eh, it was another ""written for TV"" shtick. It would be a decent popcorn flick to stream online. The editor should have advised the author to cut out 2/3 of the repeated phrasing in the story about the MC's family/etc. I think that would take out about 30 pages. Maybe that's why it's still in there? =P "
545,3.0,"This was ok Mira is on her way home to her emotionally fragile mother on xmas eve and there is a snow storm that has cancelled her flight. She is offered a ride in a rental car by her seatmate on her previous flight, her and her 3 friends or so she thinks are driving to Miras destination and will drop her off. Well it turns out no one actually knows each other and everything keeps going wrobg also unbeknownst to Mira she has a stalker and that stalker is in the car, who? We have to read the whole thing for a slightly underwhelming reveal. I like snow storms, so thats how this book went from a 2 star to a 3 star . It was very ...ok. "
546,5.0,"Mira catches a flight to visit her mom, but the airport cancels her remaining flight due to a heavy snow storm. She met Harper on the plane, and Harper decides to rent a car and drive them where they need to go. Harper also brings a few other passengers she met on the flight.Five people packed in the car and off they go! Then things start falling apart.This book didn't stop with the twists, turns, and drama. They main plot was a bit unrealistic, but putting yourself in a car full of a bunch of people you don't know and trust, things start going missing, and every disaster that can possibly happens does, well it makes it a fun and exciting thrill ride. I completely enjoyed this."
547,2.0,"I am shocked this was chosen as a group library read. It’s terrible. I only made it about 1/3 through before I decided I just can’t take any more. It wasn’t good from the beginning but i just wanted to finish and figured it was relatively short. But I couldn’t. The writing is very amateurish and I don’t mean because it’s YA. I read a lot of YA and find so many authors clever and engaging. I gave it 2 stars because there is an attempt to make it thrilling. But in the end, I was reading a lot of words yet nothing was actually happening… and I just couldn’t bring myself to care. "
548,4.0,"3.5 StarsSo this was a real quick read and rather enjoyable. Given other reviews I was not sure what to expect. Right from the start I was sucked in and ready to see where things would go. Things went haywire, for sure and I still can't believe the heroine got into a car with four random strangers all because she had to get home to be their for her mother. It's clear the heroine has a stalker but who out of the group is it? I figured out pretty early on who it was which was disappointing but I think the pacing of the story kept things moving and interesting. Personally I think the heroine should have made smarter choices at multiple points in the book. When these strangers showed their true selves she should have gotten far away but she didn't and I'm still not sure why. (view spoiler)[Stealing gas was one thing but my God when that kid got run over, that would have been the end game for me. And to just drive away and get over it in no time I don't get it. And more importantly I'm kind of pissed the hitchhiker was never something touched on in the end. This same random stranger who was without a vehicle yet who managed to magically be everywhere they were before them. And mind you they're in the middle of a blizzard, traveling for hours, taking random roads and yet still this man manages to be there and after he saves them in the end, it's just forgotten and I don't get it. (hide spoiler)]Fun, quick and suspenseful read."
549,3.0,"Joined the Big Library Read today. . . .pretty good tale, a thriller and unexpected (mostly) twists. Set in the middle of a national snow storm during the holidays. It's every person for themselves to find a way home.Who doesn't want to spend that with 5 strangers, one of which (at least one) is maniacal?!?******BYOB (bring your own blanket, cuz you're gonna get cold)"
550,3.0,"Not super impressed with this one. I think it was too PG for my liking. I felt like it dragged on and when something finally happened, I was left feeling....dissatisfied. It was super predictable.I was really looking forward to this book. I love survival type stories especially in a wintry/snowy setting. They’re my favorite, fiction or nonfiction. So, I’m pretty bummed about it. It could be because this is a Young Adult Thriller 🤷🏻‍♀️ and I’m so used to reading full on adult Horror/Thrillers. "
551,4.0,"When a blizzard cancels her flight, Mira is desperate to get home to her mother for Christmas. Last year her aunt died and her mother is grieving. Mira has been receiving letters over the past year that make this get seriously twisted. She hitches a ride with a few collage kids that were on her flight. Mira is eighteen but she tells them she is in college. She soon finds out the weather isn't the problem. None of them actually know each other and one of them isn't who they claim to to be, and they want Mira. The plot and characters are so twisted and I kept trying to figure out who. This was a wild ride. A YA thriller that had me flipping the pages.Thank you to Source Books for copy of this book.Dawnny Ruby Novels N Latte Hudson Valley NY "
552,4.0,"I liked this book very much but at times, the writing got a little repetitive. I also guessed the bad guy about half way through the book, though I wasn't sure. Not the best thriller I've read, but still a very good book."
553,4.0,"Overall Rating : B+Five strangers at an airport find a car together to race home before the blizzard catches up to them. As you can guess, it does not work out well.This wasnt really what I was expecting and surprisingly, that made it better.It stretched a little in some places, and a little cringy in others, but otherwise a pretty decent thriller for a YA."
554,4.0,"3.5 StarsI wouldn't want to find myself driving in a blizzard in the middle-of-nowhere Pennsylvania with Five Total Strangers. I was struck with terror finding myself driving over dark country roads with this shady bunch of characters! Richards did a good job at keeping me on full alert and keeping my suspicions bouncing all over the place. However, the abrupt ending left me just slightly unsatisfied. I wanted to know more about that guy with the yellow hat!"
555,3.0,"2.5/3* I didn't realize this book was YA when I started it, however, I love YA so it was no big deal. But there are some YA that are just too young for my taste and this was unfortunately one of them. I don't even have kids, but for any teenager reading this review, just don't ever pull a stunt like this. Geez. 🤦🏻"
556,3.0,"This was November’s Big Library Read. It is YA, fast-paced, suspenseful, and easy to read. Nothing about it will likely stick with me though."
557,3.0,"❐ Overall Rating 3⭐ | Narration 😁 = Very Good❐ Narrated by Devon Sorvari❐ Listening Length: 7H 56M❐ YA Mystery Thriller❐ Winter StormThis felt like one bad decision after another...making each one feel less believable as the story progressed. But it still might work for someone on the young side of YA. I feel like I’m not the target audience...despite all the characters being over the age of 18 because this plays out in a way that feels overly juvenile. The snowstorm ride through the Mountains was pretty intense, though. Moral of the story: listen to your Mother! (cawpile score = 5.43/10)"
558,3.0,"3/5 ⭐️ This was actually pretty entertaining! I’d never get in a car full of strangers, even to get home for Christmas! But it had some pretty good shocking moments as well!"
559,3.0,I sat thru an entire book for 3 pages of an ending?!?! Okay this book is definitely a slow burn but it was interesting! I wanted to know about these people or why they were there and all that but man I was a little bored. It was a really quick read but I found myself wanting to put it down frequently. I think this book may work better for other people but this book just didn’t do it for me. I was disappointed that nothing was resolved at the end and I didn’t get to see how the other kids reacted after. Idk just not for me
560,1.0,"As soon as all 5 characters were introduced on page… 15 ish.. I went “Yup, ‘X’ is the the creepy stalker antagonist.” The other 300 or whatever pages are just fodder. Lo and behold… I was correct. Waste of time. "
561,3.0,Waffling. More to come.
562,4.0,"This book was fabulous! With so many twists and turns I literally had no idea what was going to happen next. This book was exactly what I hoped it would be! It had plenty of dodgy characters, everything in the world going wrong, and absolutely no way out.I'll start with the characters since I believe they were so well developed. I loved that each character had different sides to them. This made it especially hard to figure out who to trust. The characters each changed so much from the beginning of the book to the end and as they were put in so many dire situations. I loved that each character was unpredictable in their own way. It really made things so confusing (in a good way) and that much more interesting!Also, I really appreciate the circumstances of this book. It would have been one thing if they were all just road-tripping home, but since it was in the middle of a blizzard, things got crazy. They hit a lot of obstacles because of the snow and got themselves in some wild situations. I just kept waiting for the next bad thing to happen because it always did.As well, there are creepy letters that are shown every few chapters which just amps up the suspense. I won't say any more about them, but just know, they're great (in a creepy way).I have some mixed feelings about the ending, but I think I'm mostly happy about it. It's a little open-ended, but I also think that might have been necessary for the book. I was totally shocked by the outcome of things which I'm pleasantly surprised about. I love it when I'm wrong about the ending of a thriller.Overall, this book was one crazy ride from hell that everyone should read. It was a great thriller that had me anxious and nervous and open-mouthed in shock for most of the book. A must-read for any thriller/suspense fan out there!Disclaimer: I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own.Blog | Instagram | Twitter"
563,1.0,This story is immensely boring it revolves around friends travelling in a car cancer and that is pretty much it. Not a very interesting story thankfully this is a library book so I didn't waste any money. The characters are dull boring stupid immature teenagers. No originality to the plot.
564,4.0,"You can find the full review and all the fancy and/or randomness that accompanies it at It Starts at Midnight 3.5*Five Total Strangers is certainly compulsively readable and highly entertaining, though I did have a few issues with it that perhaps took me out of the story a little? Though if I am being completely fair, I probably noticed these things more than a typical person did- partly because I live here, and partly because I am just kind of weird about random stuff? Anyway, I will break it on down!
The Good:
  ►Like I said, this book was a page-turner! I wanted- nay, needed- to know who was up to what! There is a mystery here, no question, but I didn't have any idea what was going on, and I love that! I basically couldn't put it down.  	 ►While the main character gets herself in a very messy situation, it made sense why she'd make these choices. Like- you might read the synopsis and be like ""girl, why the heck?"" and right? But it does make sense in context! I mean, your home life is a mess, and you know your mom is going through it, you'd want to be home from Christmas too!  The author nails the atmosphere. I mean, it feels exactly as desperate as you'd expect, being stuck in the snow in the middle of nowhere! I was creeped out, no question!  ►I liked Mira, and rathered she not be murdered by a blizzard compatriot. I mean, the fact that she cared so much about her mother's well-being was quite lovely. And I was certainly interested in the other characters too, even if I wasn't sure if I could trust a damn one of them.  
The Not:
  ►The geography was just wrong. Again, look, I know that this is likely a ""me"" thing. But the way these people were driving made no sense! And the author kept talking about Newark Airport like it's in Pennsylvania when it is very not and then implying that I-80 is near Philly, which again, so much nope. And while it is maybe a silly gripe, it did take me out of the story because I kept having to suspend... well, not disbelief, perhaps suspend knowledge of Mid-Atlantic Highway Systems? 🤷‍♀️  ►I would have liked to know more about the cast of characters, especially at the end. I mean, I liked getting to know them as much as we did, and I did enjoy that they were all fairly mysterious throughout (they had to be, for the sake of the story, really). But after we knew all the stuff, it would have been nice to find out a bit about them. An epilogue, perhaps?  
Bottom Line: 
I devoured this atmospheric thriller, even if a few things may have taken me out of the story a bit. Definitely worth the read, especially as winter approaches (so you, too, can be freaked out by impending weather patterns!)"
565,1.0,If I could unread this book. I would
566,4.0,"3.5 stars rounded up! The story didn’t grab me from page one, but once I got into I couldn’t put it down!!!! A smidge predictable, but it didn’t keep me from being on the edge of my seat and questioning myself until the reveal! Definitely a good read!"
567,4.0,"I love books that are fast paced. I never want to put them down. I've enjoyed everything I've read by Natalie D. Richards so far. While I did guess correctly on who was most dangerous, I did find myself doubting and wondering if was wrong.Mira left San Diego to return home to her mom. There is a snowstorm and the flights were all cancelled from her layover stop. She met a girl, Harper, on the plane who was renting a car. Mira knew her mom would be upset since she lost her twin sister the previous Christmas. Harper met three others, Brecken, Josh, and Kayla and they all decided to ride together. Things start going wrong right away. They cannot get home and narrowly miss a big accident. Luckily they were able to crush through other cars. Their stop at a gas station went really bad. That's when the first thing goes missing. Everyone starts to find a missing item and they turn on each other a bit. Mira had been feeling off since she got into the car. She knew something was wrong and she wasn't sure that she could trust any of the strangers with her. In between some chapters, we read letters that were written to Mira that she never received. Those letters give us a bit of insight into who might be in the car with them or following them.I gave this book 4 stars. Thank you to Firereads/Sourcebooks Fire for my review copy.Warnings for cancer, addiction, blood/cuts, car accidents, depression, and death. "
568,4.0,"This is my first experience with Richards' writing - and I am quite sure that it won't be my last! This one is suspenseful from the very start! Mira is trying to get home to her mother for Christmas. Her mother, still grieving for the twin sister that passed a year earlier, also inspires plenty of guilt in Mira for abandoning her for the other side of the country for school. But inclement weather disturbs Mira's travel plans and she decides to ride share in a rental car with four other people - and it's not long before everyone is doubting one another, things go missing and sabotage is suspected. The book is fast-paced and chilling! It's easy to sympathize with Mira and it's hard to predict all the twists and turns of the plot. I think that this one has a great visual appeal too, and it would be easy to see this as thrilling film. Tension mounts from almost every angle and while the ending may leave a few things unaddressed, it doesn't stop this from being a satisfying winter thriller from start to finish! And while Mira's age makes this more of a YA read, I think that adult readers would also be riveted by her plight. It will certainly make you think twice about driving or flying in a snowstorm! "
569,3.0,"This story felt like a YA version of No Exit, but did not have the ""edge of your seat"" suspense. Pennsylvania roads during a major snow storm was a perfect setting for a thriller. For the most part, this story held my interest and kept me wondering which stranger was up to no good. The ending though was a little abrupt. Since I live in Pennsylvania, there were three things that really annoyed me in the story:1. The synopsis on the back cover said they were stranded at Philadelphia Airport, but in the book  they flew in to Newark Airport.2. Why would a girl living in Pittsburgh fly to Newark (or Philadelphia) to get home?3. No one that lives in Pennsylvania would think it would be a smart idea to get off Interstate 78 &  take Interstate 80 that takes you through the Pocono Mountains during a major snow storm."
570,4.0,"Five Total Strangers is a quick YA thriller. It involves, 18 year old Mira who gets stranded in an airport due to an impending blizzard. She ends up in a car with 4 strangers in an effort to drive home.. She begins to realize that the friendly people she hitched a ride with might no be so friendly after all.I thought this was an enjoyable read. The book is told through the perspective of only Mira. That did help with te suspense because we find out things along with her. Sprinkled throughout are letters from an anonymous person to Mira. I was undecided for a long time about who they were from. My first guess was wrong, so that was a bonus. My biggest complaint was you kind of have to suspend a little bit of disbelief in the story. Certain events fall into place a bit too conveniently. However, I do think this is worth giving a read. It was good entertainment for the afternoon."
571,4.0,"4.5🌟Woo! This one was a nail-biter! I could not out it down, and read it within 24 hours of starting. 🤯Five Total Strangers is just that. Five early 20's and late teens all decide to share a care to get home after a winter storm causes flight cancellations. Things start going wrong on this adventure,and just stay going wrong. At first you think, could it just be bad luck? I don't really want to say a ton about this though, because that is what kept me turning the pages! The anxiety was HIGH through out the entire book.😱The characters weren't really that well developed I feel, and there also a lot of loose ends. Thankfully, those didn't really change how the story ends though. I'm giving this 4.5 stars because it was like watching a twisty thriller movie in my head and it kept my interest.It probably won't be as high of a rating for everyone else, but I'm ok with that!"
572,4.0,"The things people do to try and get home quickly never go well. But it does make for a good read, this followed the story of five young adults stuck in an airport trying to get home, so they opt on renting a car despite the blizzard like conditions outside. Mistrusts and everything that could go wrong does go wrong but it still kept me reading to find out who really was the person to mistrust. It was a fast paced read, had a similar feel to No Exit but on a lighter scale. "
573,2.0,"Mira is trying to get home to be with her grief stricken mother. Unfortunately the weather has become hazardous as a blizzard is rolling in. Flights are cancelled and Mira is uncertain of how she will get home. A group of four other passengers on Mira’s flight decide to rent a car and make the drive, inviting Mira along. Desperate with no other options Mira accepts the ride and it quickly becomes clear maybe this wasn’t a good idea. After all these people are strangers and strange things are happening. This was a great premise - five strangers stuck alone in a car during a blizzard and none of them seem trustworthy. However, this was extremely amateur. I found none of the characters likable or what was going on enjoyable. I seen some describe it as suspense/ thriller and I found it only to be that for a short time. It was anticlimactic from start to finish. "
574,4.0,This was actually a better audiobook than I was expecting. The ending fell a bit short for me BUT I did get a bit of a surprise with the reveal. 5 strangers trying to get home for Christmas. Do a few of them know each other? Is someone planning something bad? Why do things keep disappearing? It was a very descriptive thriller that kept you curious and wanting to know who was behind these weird occurrences and why!!
575,4.0,"This book was a nice, wintery thriller. Driving in the snow gives me all sorts of anxiety, so why not read a thriller that is about 5 strangers car pooling to get home in time for Christmas after the snow storm grounds all flights? I thought this was well written and had quite a bit of excitement. I found myself eager to read more just to find out what happens. I feel like some of the main characters lacked details and I could’ve known more about them, but all in all it was a fun read! "
576,3.0,2.75⭐Started out very strong and I really liked the first half but the plot twist was just so bad and unbelievable. The ending left me feeling unsatisfied there were just so many unanswered questions.The book would have been way better if the author had just focused on the horror road trip instead of trying to bring a crime element into the story!
577,5.0,"Believable, probably not.... but I couldn't put this one down. I stress ate the whole time and I loved it. A young girl ends up in a car on a road trip in a snow storm with 1 passenger who many not want them all to arrive safely. I flipped back and forth on who to trust and basically screamed at my book too many times to count. "
578,3.0,3.5.This was a gripping young adult thriller that kept me wanting to know what happened next. There were some unanswered questions and some suspension of disbelief but it was fun and that's what I want in a thriller.
579,4.0,four stars was a little nice
580,3.0,I enjoyed this one and the cover too however I was a little disappointed in the ending feeling rushed and lacking some things. I do find myself reading Ms. Natalies books because she is quick with pacing and characters too just wanted a better ending!
581,5.0,"Oh my goodness! I read this all in one sitting, and it was insane!!! Highly recommend!"

589,2.0,No 
590,2.0,"I don't like to give negative reviews because art is subjective, so suffice it to say that I personally felt like this book was lacking in plot, character development, and engagement. It had two elements that I was excited about, non- mushy Christmas setting and Pittsburgh (as I'm a native from the region) but despite that it still fell flat for me. "
591,3.0,"This wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't a great book! I found that it had a little too much redundancy...such long conversations about which road to take, for example. The many coincidences kind of pushed it past plausibility for me."
592,5.0,Low-key wanna go on a road trip now.
593,4.0,I really wish they would have summed up everyone's story but overall a good book.
594,4.0,This book hooked me from the start! It was a less gruesome version of No Exit which is one of my favorites! The perfect locked room mystery that kept you guessing till the end! I wasn’t shocked by the ending and somewhat expected it but overall it was a good book!
595,4.0,does drag a bit in the middle and i was a bit tired but it’s SHOCKING!!!
596,3.0,Meh. It should have been better. Such unfulfilled promise.
597,2.0,"Unfortunately this wasn't really for me. The characters have no depth, hearing them bicker constantly got tiresome and I figured out who the culprit is early. However, the author did a good job at casting suspicion on everyone. I think this would appeal to younger readers who are just getting into thrillers."
598,4.0,"it was so obvious her stalker was josh, kinda disappointing cus all the build up could’ve led to a good plot twist"
599,2.0,DNF. I tried reading through but it got kind of gory pretty quickly. I wanted this to be good. but it is what it is.
600,5.0,"The RideMira is anxious to get home for Christmas. A year ago on Christmas, she lost her Aunt Phoebe, her mother's twin. Her mother had told her that it was like losing one of her lungs; that she didn'’t think she would ever breathe right again.The loss of Aunt Phoebe taught Mira that when your world falls to pieces, your brain will not keep you moving, your brain will shut down to a low static hum, as your heart tears itself in half and aches until you’re sure you’ll die, until some part of you wishes you could die.. It’s your instincts that will keep you alive, because sometimes it is easier to force strength for others than to allow ourselves to feel weak and hurt. On the other hand,.grief reminds us that we are small: that we are not in control.Mira also wants to get home to see her lifelong friend, Zari with whom she shared what felt like an endless conversation—a rapid-fire back-and-forth with no need for hello or goodbye or small talk; just pick up at whatever random place they had left off the last time they talked.A deterrent to getting her home is a blizzard that has set in, leaving Mira stranded at the airport. Harper, her seatmate on the plane, rents a car and bringing along three people with her: a girl and two boys, offers to drop Mira home on their way. Mira assumes they are all friends and is embarrassed when she learns that they are all total strangers.Seeing a sports car sitting on its roof in the ditch, flipped over like a turtle, four tires like curling legs, the dark underbelly exposed, Mira's stomach tightens. Every year in Pennsylvania when a dozen snowflakes hit the road, all common sense pours directly out of drivers’ brains.Items begin disappearing, Harper's wallet, Josh's book, Mira's phone, Brecken's backup battery, a map. Then a knife, the kind you see behind glass in the camping section, appears where Mira had been sitting. Missing her wallet, Harper is not able to pay for the gas she bought and all their combined monies aren't enough to pay for the gas. The gas station owner pursues them in order to settle the bill after Brecken decides to hightail it out of the station. Everybody starts yelling, and Mira crosses her arms over her chest rocking gently back and forth in her seat. Everyone's full attention focuses now on Mira, asking her if she is okay and she replies: I’m fine,” as she learned after Phoebe that if you say it enough, people believe you. Say it even more, and you’ll believe it yourself.When the missing items are found on top of envelopes addressed to Mira, she realizes she is being stalked. As Mira was the one who found the missing items , everyone is now accusing Mira of stealing them. Mira realizes that she is not safe now, and hasn’t been safe since she accepted this ride; taking a sharp breath and looking at her fellow travelers with new wariness, she knows that someone in this car is lying.Numbness is a gift that keeps us moving and helps us to survive the things that feel unsurvivable such as this whole ordeal which we could choose to believe is nothing more than the worst nightmare that these strangers could collectively conjure, pretending that none of this is real."
601,5.0,"FIVE TOTAL STRANGERS is a thrilling ride that kept me guessing. Mira is on her way to her mother's house for Christmas, flying across the country on Christmas Eve. Her seatmate is a chatty college-aged woman named Harper who seems to be very used to travel. When turbulence hits, they are somewhat shaken, arriving at the airport to find out all flights are grounded for a blizzard coming through that night. Harper says she needs to get home and offers Mira a ride along the way.Mira declines, but then she calls her stepfather to learn that her mother is keeping secrets and as this will be the first anniversary of her twin's death, Mira is afraid that her mother will fall back into a depression. Mira feels danger in her gut but decides to go with Harper and her three friends anyway, as she really needs to get to her mother. The brunt of the book follows their journey through the blizzard, strangers, and the knowledge that one of them may be sabotaging this perilous trip.This was quite a ride, and I found it to be an excellent page-turner. We know the suspects and get tidbits of their thoughts along the way. Mira is an intriguing character - mix of girl and adult as expected for someone who recently turned 18. The journey is dangerous for the weather and for the secrets that are being kept along the way. The other characters are an interesting and secretive mix that really set the scene so well. With the Christmas Eve setting, this is a perfect thriller for a fall read.I was completely enthralled the whole way through, and I would definitely recommend picking this up when you have a good chunk of time to read - it is hard to put down! Highly recommend for people who like YA thrillers with some poor decisions, dangerous characters, and compelling plot. Everyone is a suspect in this captivating read that will keep the reader guessing.Please note that I received an ARC through Sourcebooks Early Reads. All opinions are my own."
603,3.0,"I would first like to thank Sourcebooks Fire for providing me with an ARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This book will be released on October 6th, 2020.I did not know what to expect going into this book. I don't read many YA Thrillers, and the ones I have read have not been my favorite (in fact, some of them I have DESPISED!). However, the plot of Five Total Strangers seemed to be one that I would really enjoy, so I gave it a chance! I did enjoy my reading of this book, but there were also some problems that I had with it. I really enjoyed that a lot of the novel was fast-paced... the reader was propelled through the book by the immense number of secrets at which were being hinted at the end of each chapter. I liked that Natalie D. Richards was able to craft characters with such seemingly shifting motives. She was really good at making it seem like it could be ALL of the characters that are up to no good. I enjoyed Richards' use of a red herring, not all author's can pull off that device, but Richards did. I liked the action sequences because they were truly intense, and had me at the edge of my seat. I REALLY loved that the book wrapped up almost IMMEDIATELY after the action! It's so common for thrillers to go on for 50 pages after the final action takes place, and it was so refreshing to read an intense scene and then almost immediately be finished with the book.However, the reasons I deducted two stars from my rating are:1) There were moments where this booked lulled... and lulled HARD. As aforementioned, much of the book was fast-paced... however, there were many scenes in the book that I TRUDGED through because of the lack of anything interesting going on. 2) There were some moments, and aspects of characters that seemed to be entirely irrelevant an unnecessary to the overall story. For example, Mira's love for art. In almost every chapter, Mira mentioned her love of art... and sometimes it was SO out of place. She would be talking about painting a tragic scene that she had just witnessed, or mention how she would recreate an image she saw while going through an intense sequence; it just didn't seem to have any point in the story. I get that she was off at school in CA because of her art... but the art aspect could've been removed from the story, and the story would not have changed at all. 3) The anti-climactic, revealed secrets. Richards builds up, for the reader, such intense suspicion of each of the characters and the secrets they're harboring. However, when those secrets are revealed, the audience is left with a SEVERE case of, for lack of a better word, blue-balls from the secrets not being ANYTHING of importance. Except for the secret of the ""plot twist,"" which brings me to...4) The ""plot-twist"" was predictable from the beginning. I don't want to say too much about this because I don't want to spoil it... but I saw the revealed antagonist as THE antagonist from the beginning... I was hoping that Richards would switch it up a bit, and choose someone else to be the antagonist because, to me, it was obvious. I was caught off guard by the FIRST part of the plot twist, and I was ACTUALLY hoping that THAT was the FULL-TWIST... but alas, it didn't hit the mark for me.So overall, this book gets 3/5 stars for me. It was an average thriller read (which is better than most YA thrillers I've read). I'd say that the negatives and positives even themselves out to create a book that, if you're new to thriller novels, may be intriguing to you."
604,4.0,"Edge of my seat. You know the feeling, somones there, near you watching you. You turn all around but there is no one around but you can feel it rising up the back of your spine like an icy chill. By the time it reaches your neck and the hairs are standing up all of your body it might just be too late. Mira is a kid desperate to reach her grief stricken mother in Pittsburgh. Flying in a snowstorm to be with her mom knowing that she needs to be there she encounters a record breaking winter storm. Flights delayed, multiple car pileups, and snow that could send a polar bear running for his den. She doesn’t know anyone or how she can get to her mom but knows she has to no matter what. Taking a chance with a fellow friendly passenger from her flight a group forms and they decide to take on the storm. Unfortunately it is not long into this trip that Mira starts to get that spine-tingling, hair raising suspicion that not all of these passengers are on this trip for the right reasons. This was an edge of my seat thriller with many twists and turns throughout. I enjoyed the descriptions of the feeling of dread you can get when strong snow storms hit. Living in the Midwest we know to hunker down when it gets to be that time of year but I also know that feeling of no matter where I am i need to get home. I enjoyed the relationships that formed and reformed and how the author was able to keep me guessing. I do feel that there were some story lines that maybe weren’t as put together as they should be but for a quick read this was a winner. I love blizzard stories and love the snow. That being said being stuck in a snowstorm in a car in the middle of nowhere is terrifying to me. This was a great quick read and I will definitely be reading more of her future works. "
605,4.0,"*Thank you Sourcebooks Fire for the eARC for review.Mira is desperate to get home for the holidays to her grieving mother. When Mira’s travel plans are suddenly halted by a brutal snowstorm, she decides to hitch a ride with four other passengers. These strangers face many difficult moments as they attempt to brave the storm as they travel the road home. Mira soon realizes that her choice to accept this ride may have been an awful decision. If you are looking for a travel thriller then this is the book for you! There are so many intense moments of chaos in this book. I was constantly on the edge of my seat as I wondered what other problems would soon plague these individuals. This book is truly a wild thrill ride. It was so hard to guess what was going to happen in this book. There were so many intense scenes that captured my attention. In this book, everyone is truly a suspect. I was fascinated by the short letters that would appear around everyone three chapters or so. The letters were so creepy! This inclusion really helped progress the tension in the novel while giving foreshadowing of ill things to come. I feel like this book is a representation of a thriller in many different, interesting ways. The ending was pretty good and a bit unexpected. I like how there was so much tension between the characters in the latter half of the novel. All of the other passengers were a suspect in this one. I did not know who to trust, or if any of them could be trusted at all. I love the snowstorm travel adventure inclusion; this made for a great setting with many interesting twists thrown in throughout the journey.Overall, this was a pretty solid thriller."
606,3.0,"Five Total Strangers is a young adult mystery thriller written by Natalie D. Richards, and is the Big Library Read Digital Book Club via the Toronto Public Library book for the 1 November–15 November, 2021 period. It centers on five strangers getting home for the holidays, which turns into a nightmare for all of them.High school student Mira Hayes has been living in San Diego with her dad while attending a prestigious art school. Now it's Christmas Eve, and all she wants to do is get home to Pittsburgh and her mom, who, like Mira, is grieving the death of her twin sister, Mira's aunt Phoebe.However, a blizzard may thwart her plans. During a layover in Newark airport, Mira learns that every flight out has been canceled. Luckily, Mira's seatmate Harper offers her a ride in her rental car along with three other stranded passengers: Brecken, Kayla, and Josh, but Mira is uneasy from the start as accepting a ride with strangers usually isn't her thing, but she's desperate to get home.However, snarled traffic forces them to resort to risky side routes, Mira feels like she's being watched, and the group’s belongings keep disappearing. As their situation becomes direr they make reckless decisions, leading readers to wonder if anyone will get home alive.Five Total Strangers is written moderately well. Richards does a serviceable job of building tension, but aside from Mira, who narrates, the other characters are thinly drawn. Letters to Mira from a menacing stranger are sprinkled throughout, but their melodramatic nature detracts from the threat, and last-minute revelations stretch credulity.All in all, Five Total Strangers is a chilly road trip is woefully short on thrills or chills."
607,3.0,"Five Total Strangers follows a girl named Mira whose connecting flight has been cancelled due to a blizzard. Desperate to get home to her mother for Christmas Day, Mira makes the decision to accept a ride with her seatmate from her first flight along with four other college students. It isn't long before she realizes that her seatmate has no connection to the other people in the car and that each of them has something to hide. Now Mira isn't sure if she'll make it out of this alive. The premise of this book is awesome and I was loving the plot up until the very last chapters where everything started to crumble. I discovered this book through the Big Library Read and, while I didn't make the deadline on that, I still read it really quickly. The suspense consumed me right from the beginning and I couldn't stop flying through the pages! I love books with road trips so coupled with the tension from the storm and the creepy fellow passengers I had a hard time putting it down. It continued to grow twistier right up until the next to last chapter when the reveal happened. After I had taken some time to process that I realized there was only one more chapter left in the book and I was really confused. I didn't know how in the world the author would be able to tie up so many loose ends and, though she tried, it just didn't work for me. (view spoiler)[ First off, I didn't like the explanation Josh had for stalking Mira. I mean, maybe that's how stalkers usually work but, in my opinion, there had to be a more creative reason than just ""destiny"". Secondly, as I know others have mentioned, how he found her was too much of a coincidence. Come on, the guy had been staking out the wrong house for weeks yet somehow manages to find her amidst hundreds of cancelled flights? And finally, the man in yellow. I thought it was really chilling how he kept turning up and the author definitely could have done something cool with that plot-line, but no. The only closure we get on him is when he shows up at the end to help them out.  (hide spoiler)]Overall, this book started strong but fell flat in the resolution. I really liked the idea of it though so will be looking out for more like it in the future. Happy Reading :)"
608,4.0,"Mira meets Harper when they sit next to each other on a plane. It's a really bumpy ride; I mean REALLY bumpy. People are actually screaming. When they finally land, Mira's just glad to be safely on the ground. She says goodbye to Harper, thinking they'll never see each other again. As Mira walks through the airport toward her connecting flight home, she sees airport employees laying out cots and blankets.... never a good sign in an airport. The snow is falling heavily outside, and one flight after the next is marked CANCELLED -- including Mira's -- even though it's Christmas Eve and everyone just wants to get home. Mira's desperate, actually. She just found out some terrible news, and her mom is going to need Mira at home to lean on.She stands there, wondering what she's going to do, when here comes Harper with 3 other people, all smiles, offering Mira a ride in the car she just rented. Mira hesitates. I mean, she doesn't really ""know"" Harper; they just met on the plane. But she was nice, and her friends seem nice, too. Her mom would kill her if she knew that Mira was getting into a car full of young adults she didn't know for a 6-hour car trip. But Mira NEEDS a ride. How bad can it be?Turns out it can be pretty bad. So many signs point to GET OUT OF HERE NOW with each passing mile... terrible weather, car accidents, creepy guys at rest stops ... and it's not just OUTSIDE of the car that's the problem. Inside, it's just as creepy. Does Harper actually even know any of these people? What's Harper hiding? Why does everybody's stuff keep disappearing? If you're looking for an intense adventure ride, take a trip with Mira in 5 Total Strangers.REVIEW: It's a page-turner! Not deep literature or anything, but if you like realistic fiction adventure or mystery, this keeps you reading. Lots of dangerous situations, some violence. Some references to drug taking by one of the characters, but nothing ""on screen"" other than the exchange of some pills. A few characters drink a beer, but they're over 21."
609,2.0,"I liked the premise of this book, but it came across as quite messy in execution. for starters, there are entirely too many villains in this book. weird man in a yellow hat seemingly following the group of kids. scary gas station man toting a shotgun. a stalker for Mira. someone stealing everyone’s belongings. a shady drug addict. it’s… a lot. the fact that the stalker was painfully obvious made all these other creeps seem even more unnecessary and over the top. it felt like a bad attempt at numerous misdirects that ultimately failed because I began suspecting who the stalker was as soon as items in the car began disappearing. Yellow Hat Guy was especially pointless, since he clearly couldn’t be the one stealing items from inside the car. I don’t get why he was even a character; he added nothing to the story. the gas station owner hunting them down in the middle of a blizzard was just ridiculous. sure, anyone would be pissed that these college kids just drove off and stole gas but to go out in the storm of the century to hunt for them, for hours, on Christmas Eve, just doesn’t seem quite believable enough to be scary. further, Mira felt so guilty that they hit Corey with the car but I mean… these men were literally trying to beat the shit out of Brecken, and while he was behind the wheel of a vehicle with its engine running. someone getting run over was pretty much inevitable at that point and everyone made stupid ass decisions, not least of all the man who dragged his son out into a blizzard to assault strangers. my sympathy is pretty low here, harsh as that probably sounds. but it was just so fucking dumb all around. how anyone became obsessed with Mira is beyond me, since the girl is about as interesting as a plastic bag and it felt completely out of left field. all of a sudden there’s these letters from a whackadoo that she never even received so she’s unaware that she has a stalker, and it felt incredibly disjointed. and then that ending. or rather “ending,” as i would not describe it as an actual conclusion. we’re left with no idea what happened to Kayla, or to Brecken and Harper, or how Josh successfully happened to weasel into the carpool in the first place, or what the fallout with Corey and his psycho dad is going to be. we don’t even get much explanation about why Mira’s mom and stepdad are divorcing, and no closure on Mira and Zari trying to patch up their friendship. it made all the emotional baggage of Mira’s; with her mom, her aunts death, her fight with her best friend; all feel pretty meaningless. the scariest things in this book were the scenes about driving through the snow storm, and how not-an-ending the ending was. there were some suspenseful moments and I thought the overall writing and dialogue were pretty solid, so I didn’t give this one star. but I am really unsatisfied with how this book played out. "
610,4.0,"This book was suggested on my Library Libby app and I thought, why not? It's a planes, trains and automobiles read with creepy feelings of who am I really traveling with???Christmas Eve and you have to make it home in time for Christmas, but all flights are grounded due to an incoming snowstorm. What is the most logical solution? Get in a car with four people you know absolutely nothing about! Talk about a road trip gone wrong. Mira hits it off with a woman she met on the plane, Harper. Her new friend has no intentions on waiting for a new flight and instead decides to rent a car and drive the remainder of the way home. At first, Mira politely declines Harper’s offer for her to tag along, but hesitantly changes her mind when she sees Harper and three other strangers waiting for the rental to pull up. Mira and the others set off with no problem in sight. Well, that quickly changes. One thing after another goes wrong, between the horrendous weather and the strange things that keep happening. Before you know it, these five total strangers are wondering if they will make it home alive. If you are looking for an action packed book to read during a snowy day, this is it! This story is extremely atmospheric and the suspense amps up from the first page to the surprising revelations. I found myself shaking my head at the poor decision making skills of the main character but loved going along for the ride. I also loved the ""road trip on Christmas Eve during a blizzard"" setting. Not a deep story but very entertaining."
611,5.0,"Mira's connecting flight got canceled on the way home for the holidays. When her sassy plane seat-mate, Harper, offers to give her a ride, she blindly accepts with her mother in mind. She needs to get home for Christmas, and this is her only option. To her surprise, Mira is not the only one in the rental car. Who are these other strangers, and what brings them together in this long ride from hell? Will Mira make it home in one piece, or are these outsiders up to no good?⠀⠀FIVE TOTAL STRANGERS is an edge of your seat thriller that'll obsessively have you flipping the pages until the very end. Natalie interpreted the Wintery setting gorgeously. The detailed, chilly atmosphere brought the story to life, making it easy to fall into Mira's shoes. Every time Mira was cold, I felt it in my bones! As for her personality, she came off as a down to earth teenager, with a shy and introvert aura. Although taking a trip in a blizzard with strangers might not have been the best judgment, it respectfully showcased her selfless attitude in getting back to her family. Plus, we've all had moments in the past where we could have ended up on dateline. Haha.⠀⠀For the other characters, Natalie sculpted each one with transcendent features. I got to know everyone's agenda and the secrets they held as the story progressed. The suspenseful undertone was evident from the start, and I was eager for the narrative to conclude. Finally, once Natalie exposed the reveal, it honestly left me feeling a bit underwhelmed. Being the story was stellar throughout, I was expecting for an explosive finish. Unfortunately, it just didn't give me the ""what the fork"" moment I was craving. Nonetheless, it still doesn't take away from the fact that FIVE TOTAL STRANGERS is an addictive thriller that's ideal for the holiday season! It also taught me to stay the hell indoors during a blizzard at all costs.My Rating: 4.5"
612,2.0,"I noticed this book before its release, and probably wouldn't have picked it up if it wasn't the big library read on overdrive. Fortunately it was very short.This book was a mess. I know what the author was trying to accomplish, but there were so many things that just didn't work. It wasn't a thriller so much as a series of unfortunate events, but like in an unfunny, non-Lemony Snicket kind of a way. The incidents that uh... the main character whose name I forgot even though I remember all the others... experienced were things that would normally occur while driving a car in a terrible snow storm, or ridiculous, implausible things that would never happen, so I couldn't even take the book seriously. (view spoiler)[ Like why would a gas station owner and his son chase someone potentially hundreds of miles (we don't know how far or how long because this book included NO TIMELINE other than all of this stuff happened throughout the span of the same day) over $40 in gas they didn't have cash for? They catch up to them and start a physical altercation for what, the money they don't have in their pocket, while carrying guns, and they can't even report them to the police, because assault with a deadly weapon is a much more serious charge than petit theft of $40 committed during an emergency situation. Then the group runs one of them over, flees the scene (again), calls the police from a different location, and the cops never even show up. But someone who does show up is a guy who has appeared multiple times on their trip, no matter how many times they change route or pause their journey, and when he turns out to be a good guy we're supposed to forget that he had no reason to magically appear like that.  (hide spoiler)]Even if all of the dumb shit that happened in this book was drastically improved through editing, I'm not sure I would have vibed with it much anyway. I'm from Florida, and this story had more snow than bad writing, so I never connected with it. I watched the author interview after, where she spent a lot of time talking about how she doesn't plot her books. Yeah babe, we can tell."

4.3/5★A suspenseful mystery-thriller book about five strangers who decided to take a ride together to be back at their home on Christmas. Little did they know, there is one person who has a whole different reason.Wow! The fact that I have two wrong suspects before I figure out who the stalker is makes this book worth reading. As a fan of mystery and thrillers, I found this book intrigued me, especially after it reach page 100. I find myself not sleeping (and completely ignoring my homework) so I could finish this book immediately.This book makes me want to read another book from the same author. I love the fact that the words that the author pick isn't hard to understand so it's easy for me, someone whose first language isn't English, to follow all the clues until the end. I should say toward the end of the story, it's easier for the reader to catch the stalker.I should say that I also love how the author represents the grief that Mira has. Not forget to mention that the detailed story of each character is also explained well in this book.

""Because sometimes it is easier to force strength for others than to allow ourselves to feel weak and hurt.""

Anyway, thank you Libby for providing us with an unlimited copy of this book. It's the main reason why I suddenly read a thriller again and fall in love with this book."

But this books ending was very short, ended fine, but was too short and fast, if you know what I mean.I also only rated it two stars because I this book was just torture, from beginning to end. Everything that happens, bad. Just such a dark story honestly.Also the love story in it or whatever shouldn’t even be called or have to do anything with love! Though The story was mysterious and kept me intrigued and reading and I couldn’t put it down, doesn’t mean I liked it a lot, it was just interesting from beginning to end...But... the author did have a good mysterious story, but I do have too say was it was too short. I feel like the author rushed through and just wanted to write a good mystery novel. But yeah, it was such a short story and I would’ve enjoyed it more if it was longer. and I also thought she could’ve done better with the characters. I liked the characters at the beginning, but then things took a twisted turn and now I hate all of them. Pathetic.So I’m not hating it at all, I’m mostly just saying I didn’t like this book a whole lot :/That was my list of pros and cons of this book. But this was my review and my opinion, just because I said this doesn’t mean you all will hate it. A lot of you could love it, or dislike it."

While the suspense was strong, once we get to the reveal, everything else feels rushed and a lot of loose ends aren’t tied up. As an adult, I also found some parts unrealistic and hard to believe.

617,4.0,"Natalie Richards has a way of crafting YA Thrillers that keep teen readers engaged and hooked into her books. I think it is because her characters are relatable and authentic--as an adult reader I cannot help but cringe at decisions made because I would not make them, but I am not a teen any longer. As an adult reading a YA book, we have to remember to take a step back and put ourselves back into a teen's mindset--do you remember how impulsive you were? Do you remember making bad decisions? Do you remember what it was like to crush on a guy or miss obvious signs of bad behavior when you can take a step back and observe from a safe distance away? Sure you can, because you have the life experiences to do so. That's what reading great books do for us--they help put us in situations without having to actually LIVE these situations to learn and grow from them. Richards is a master at doing that and it is because of this her characters always ring true and authentic even when I wish they would not make those choices!Her latest features her trademark style of engaging writing style coupled with authentic believable characters that create a highly readable and enjoyable YA Thriller. I would not hesitate to put this in the hands of any of my students (grades 7-12th). Content warnings for drug use, drinking, and violence. "

The Story:
 Mira is left stranded in Newark Airport as all layover flights are cancelled due to a blizzard. Desperate to get home for Christmas with her mother at Pittsburgh, Mira agrees to hitch a ride with Harper, her seatmate in their earlier flight, together with a group of college kids. As the drive progresses and the weather is getting worse, Mira soon realizes that not only Harper and the other four passengers are complete strangers to each other, but someone is making sure that they don't get home. 
My thoughts:
 This was one wild thrilling ride right from the beginning! An excellent page-turner that kept me at the edge of my seat till the end! I really liked this locked-room mystery or in this case, ""closed-car"" mystery in a blizzard plot. Everyone can be a suspect even Mira herself and I liked how it gets more mysterious and sinister as the plot progresses.Not going to lie, I did find some parts that did not make sense or too coincidental but overall, this was one YA thriller I enjoyed! Fast-paced, suspense-filled with five unreliable characters make one entertaining read! "
620,4.0,"This book will make a great movie!I thoroughly enjoy it. It was a fast read that I finished in 1 sitting and it can count as a cross over from young adult to adult fiction.A chanced meeting on a plane and a blizzard = your worst nightmare. It's a year after Mira's aunt, and her mom's twin sister passed away. It's also Xmas eve and she wants to get home to her mom but her connecting flight is cancelled due to a terrible snowstorm. a Girl she sat next to on the flight invites her to join her and 3 other young people in taking a car so they can get to their destinations.......cue horror music because this is where it all goes wrong. Are all the people in the car who they seem to be or are there more sinister reasons for 1 of them to be there? Look this is not a storyline we haven't seen before but I still enjoyed it very much and it kept me guessing till the end. The 1 fringe character was not needed in my opinion but I can understand why he was there because it added to the sinister feel of the book. Thank you to NetGalley and Sourcebooks for the ARC in exchange for my honest opinion."

And then, along the journey, creepy things start happening.I enjoyed this thriller, which is advertised as a YA book. I'm far from being young but I enjoy reading thrillers that take place in adverse conditions and this was no exception.The story was fast-paced, ratcheting up the suspense level quickly. I liked the mix of characters. My only complaint is that some of the happenings were really off-the-wall and not all got tied up by the end of the book. But I guess that's why some things are called coincidences and this is fiction, after all. And I still enjoyed the story.I received this book from Sourcebooks Fire through Edelweiss in the hopes that I would read it and leave an unbiased review."
622,3.0,"Our main character, Mira, is flying home to Pittsburgh to spend Christmas with her mother when a record-breaking blizzard results in a cancelled flight during her layover. Desperate get home, Mira hitches a ride with a group of four friendly college kids who were on her initial flight. They rent an SUV and embark on what’s supposed to be a six-hour drive, eight tops. Things start to go wrong pretty fast. First of all, Mira realizes that the four other passengers she's stuck in the car with don't actually know one another, as she had assumed. The weather gets worse and worse, slowing travel to a crawl. There are near-miss accidents. Items start going missing, and everyone starts pointing fingers. The low-level feeling of dread increases. Oh yeah – we also find out early on that one of the passengers has been stalking Mira in California, so that’s a fun fact. Buckle up, friends, because things are about to get terrifying. I thought the book was a quick read and well-paced. Was it the best YA thriller I’ve ever read? No, but I liked it well enough. I did have a few problems with the book—not everything that happened was completely realistic, but I understand why the author had to throw out some red herrings along the way. Overall, I felt like this was an enjoyable ride. "

As the winter storm increases, the roads get worse and the company gets strange as things start to go horribly wrong. Will Mira make it home in time for Christmas? Will she make it home at all?""Five total strangers connected over Christmas. For all we know this could be the start of some brilliant, lifelong friendship.""If you enjoy the locked-in style of thrillers, this one is for you! This was fast-paced and engaging. I had my doubts about every character and every chapter left me with more questions than answers. The addition of a potential stalker made the plotline even more intriguing. This is exactly the type of winter read I enjoy and was everything I wanted No Exit to be and wasn't (I hated No Exit. I said what I said. 💁🏻‍♀️). Grab a blanket and a cup of something warm and settle in with this one!"
624,4.0,"A Christmas Eve blizzard and a desperate need to get home to her mom leaves Mira trapped in a car with four total strangers. The threat of disaster looms around every corner, and not just from the blizzard and black-ice roads; everyone (including Mira) has something to hide. Although whose intentions are truly sinister? Only turning those pages will lead you closer to the truth. As the blizzard kicks up flurries of snow, things go from bad to worse to couldn’t get any worse to… it gets worse. And our five total strangers are in trouble.Narrated in the first person by main character Mira, who is passionate about art and an aspiring artist, the story is filled with vivid and engaging descriptions. Also, first-person narrators can lie, and so can everything Mira says be trusted? It’s another piece of the puzzle that will test your brain as you try to figure out what’s really going on. The end ties everything up nicely, but left me wanting for a few more pages to spend with the characters.If you’re looking for a book to kick up your heartbeat, this is it."
625,4.0,"I was unsure what to expect when picking up this book but was not disappointed. Like the author, living in Ohio means blizzards are all too familiar and was interested to see how this story panned out. The plot was interesting and new, mostly taking place in a car. There were so many moving pieces to this story that left me hanging onto every word. First, we are introduced to Mira's stalker even though we have no idea who they are or how they fit into the story in the first place. Next, we have this unsettling feeling taking over Mira's instincts with no indication of who or what is causing her to feel this way. Finally, random items from everyone's bags begin to go missing but seem to all be related in the sense that these items were the only thing connecting them to others outside of the car. I needed to know how all these things added up and could not stop turning pages until I found out just that. Natalie ties up all loose ends by the last page answering all of my questions. The ending was slightly predictable, but nonetheless beautifully written story that left me biting my nails nervous for Mira and the rest of the car's passengers."

627,3.0,"When Mira finds herself trapped at the airport during a snowstorm, she jumps at the chance to get home for Christmas with a girl she met on the flight who's planning to rent a car and drive through the storm. She thinks Harper, Josh, Brecken, and Kayla are friends from college - only to discover once they're on the road that none of them know each other. Then the storm worsens, and things begin to go missing, and they find themselves in an isolated area with an angry gas station owner chasing them, and each of them has a secret...This was a solid thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Mira's plight - needing to get home to her mom who would otherwise be spending Christmas alone - fueled her bad decisions, even if I was internally screaming each time they stopped the car and started going through all their bags. Why so many stops?? And the tantalizing letters from someone stalking Mira, even though she didn't know about them until later, had me racing to figure out who it was, since it could have been anyone. I love a good story with small group dynamics and this one did not disappoint."
628,2.0,"This was not good. I read it because it's one of this year's Teen's Top Ten and I simply do not understand why. Despite being a 'suspense' book it really drags and could've easily been a 100 page novella. Even with all the extra length, there is almost no depth to any of the characters. They all make awful choices and none of the dialogue feels genuine. I'm also not sure why this is even a young adult book. The characters are young adults, yes, but only by their stated age, they don't really seem to act, talk, or think like teens at all. I had to regularly suspend my disbelief to go along with the ""twists"". I didn't even root for the main character. She was just constantly nauseous, suspicious, and had to be ""brave for her mom"" which was stated SO incredibly often. AND the ending was bad, way too many loose ends and lingering questions. Anyway, just read a synopsis, this isn't worth the read."
629,3.0,"This was pretty average, although I didn't predict who the bad guy was until the end so definite points for that! Really struggled to buy the decisions made by these characters and some of the circumstances that drive the plot. Even old-fashioned gas stations make you prepay for gas these days, don't they? And I was begging the main character to take off her damn coat everytime she got too hot in the car and felt nauseous! Finally, I felt the villain(s?) could have used a little more clarity and definition in the end. But it's pretty tough with a book like this to keep the reader constantly guessing so that's really no small feat. I wanted something engrossing enough to prevent bedtime rumination without being *so"" engrossing I cared about missing details or falling asleep (the goal)... This did the job perfectly, so I am grateful!And honestly, for a young adult audience, the message of ""don't go on a road trip during a blizzard"" is probably a good one."
630,3.0,"After loving the author's previous two books, one of which is an all-time favorite of mine, no one's more surprised than me that I didn't end up loving The Lincoln Highway.Emmett has just been released from a juvenile detention facility after serving time for involuntary manslaughter. Now that his father has passed away and he no longer has family in town, he plans to pick up his little brother and drive along the Lincoln Highway to California so that they can start anew. But his carefully laid plans fall by the wayside when his friends show up and force him to embark on a different journey altogether.I hate to say it, but this book confused me. I thought Emmett was our protagonist, and I was all ready to cheer him on as he did whatever he needed to do to start a new life, mainly by driving along the Lincoln Highway (hence the name of the book, right?). But this must be a case of mismatched expectations because Emmett wasn't the actual focus of this book and he didn't drive along that namesake road.Emmett is but one character out of many in this book, and he shares equal limelight with them all. Each of these characters has their points of view and ample time in the book, filled with their corresponding backgrounds and narratives. But the issue is that the tales of these side characters are not vital to the story. You can just cut out their turns and still have essentially the same story overall. So to include them made the whole thing feel bloated and unfocused.It doesn't help that a bunch of the side characters kept clowning around and getting up to shenanigans throughout the entire book. It almost feels like slapstick comedy, where outrageous things happen just for some laughs. This was especially odd because a lot of the notable events in here were people getting beat up or killed. But there was this incongruous, jokey tone permeating those scenes that didn't really go with whatever horrible event was happening.That isn't to say this was all bad. I still enjoyed Towles's writing, even if I didn't really connect with the story. He always includes these little bits of wisdom coated in humor, and I gobbled up the Greek mythology references in here, as well as the trip down memory lane to FAO Schwarz. Clearly Towles was paying homage to 1950s Americana, and he does well from the parts I could pick up. But in the end, I just wasn't the right audience for this book, and I hope other readers trying this will have better luck than I did.This was my Book of the Month pick for October.

Buckle up HERE WE GO!!!!!!READY TO MEET YOUR FELLOW TRAVELERS?Emmet Watson, age 18 is being driven to his home in Nebraska after having been released from a juvenile work farm. Emmet’s mother has been absent for many years and now his father has passed away and the family home and failed farm are in foreclosure. Emmet will have sole custody of his younger brother Billy. He has come home to settle things and to pick up his brother and his car. He is ready to start life anew, out of Nebraska and headed West, Texas or California.Young Billy Watson has been waiting for his brother’s return for 18 months. He welcomes him with open arms!!!!!!!After their father died, a neighbor and friend watched Billy until Emmett was released. Billy is a curious little guy, super intelligent and with lots of love to share, he has some interesting tastes in books! His very favorite “big red book'' is something he keeps in his backpack at all times. “PROFESSOR ABACUS ABERNATHE’S COMPENDIUM OF HEROES, ADVENTURERS AND OTHER INTREPID TRAVELERS”. Given to him by the school librarian it is his most prized possession! Billy will read many stories to friends along the way!!As soon as the warden drives away, two of Emmet’s friends from the farm appear on his doorstep, having hidden in the back of the truck, they still have part of their “sentence” to complete. Duchess is a “wild and crazy” guy. He’s mostly kind hearted but has hatched a plan with Wooley that should get them all a lot of money.He’s an alcoholic and often not dependable.

He will, however, inherit money from his grandfather when he turns 18. Wooley isn’t really that interested in the money, to him friendship and trust are more important. He is a somewhat troubled young man, always different from his peers, and often ignored by his family. He always felt like a PIECE OF A PUZZLE THAT DIDN'T FIT!I completely lost myself in this story. Mr. Towles is a master storyteller. While I enjoyed his prior books, this one is definitely my favorite. This novel and cast of characters drew me in. It is, of course, beautifully and meticulously written. At times a bit wordy, I loved how this group of adventurers continued to get side tracked to different places. THAT’S A LOT LIKE LIFE ITSELF!!!The characters are so real, I feel a little lost now that the book is over. I had to wait a day to write this review because I knew I would “gush” and I still have. This is a book that I would love to put into everyone’s hands! It’s about family that we are born into and families that are “made” by a combination of the people we love. This is a quote from the novel “Wouldn’t it have been wonderful, thought Woolly, if everybody’s life was like a piece in a jigsaw puzzle. . . .one person’s life would just fit snugly in its very own, specially designed spot, and in so doing, would enable the whole intricate picture to become complete”. Is that not a beautiful quote?This novel is set to publish on October 5, 2021.I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher and author through Edelweiss. ,"

The story is in some ways about The Lincoln Highway, but just a wee bit. It is more about the people, the lives, the characters. Before anyone asks the question, I agree that A Gentleman in Moscow, one of my favourite books, is not about Moscow, and it was clear from the start that the story would be about a gentleman.

Thank you, Amor Towles!!--🚗 The book - The Lincoln HighwaySet in Kansas in the 1950s, this is the story of 18-year-old Emmett Watson, his brother Billy and a few friends and strangers. After being released from a work facility where he was serving sentence for involuntary manslaughter, Emmett, who has recently lost his father and also his home and farm, decides to go on a road trip along with his brother. However, things don't go as planned, as two of Emmett`s friends from the facility decide to ‘borrow’ his Studebaker. Emmett is forced to postpone their road trip plan and now decide to get on a freight train in pursuit of the friends to get back their car. Introducing, Emmett Watson -""Most people need a ladder and a telescope to make sense of two plus two. That’s why it’s usually more trouble than it’s worth to explain yourself. But not Emmett Watson. He’s the type of guy who can see the whole picture right from the word go—the grander scheme and all the little details.”""Emmett was raised to hold no man in disdain. To hold another man in disdain, his father would say, presumed that you knew so much about his lot, so much about his intentions, about his actions both public and private that you could rank his character against your own without fear of misjudgment.”Emmett`s room - ""While there was a chip in the plaster where a nail had once been lodged, there were no pictures hanging, no posters or pennants. There was no radio or record player. And while there was a curtain rod above the window, there were no curtains. If there had been a cross on the wall, it could well have been the cell of a monk.”Here's Sally Ransom -”I do it because it’s time‑ consuming.I do it because it’s old‑ fashioned.And I do it because it’s unnecessary.Just because something’s new doesn’t mean it’s better; and often enough, it means it’s worse. Saying please and thank you is plenty old‑fashioned. Getting married and raising children is old‑ fashioned.

[Route map of the Lincoln Highway, wikipedia.org][Mr. Carl Fisher, wikipedia.org]Originally thought of and planned, in 1912, by an automobile entrepreneur, Mr Carl G. Fisher, the highway was named after Abraham Lincoln and it was the very first road to stretch from one end of America to the other. Mr Fisher built the first section in 1913 in DeKalb, Illinois, with the help of donations. The contributors included US presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, and also the inventor Thomas Edison. The highway starts in Times Square in New York City and ends 3,389 miles away in Lincoln Park in San Francisco. --📝 Quotes and notes of the brilliant prose:==========The willingness to take a beating: That’s how you can tell you’re dealing with a man of substance.

But another way to express the same idea was that through our misdeeds we put ourselves in another person’s debt, just as through their misdeeds they put themselves in ours. And since it’s these debts—those we’ve incurred and those we’re owed—that keep us stirring and stewing in the early hours, the only way to get a good night’s sleep is to balance the accounts.
==========The funny thing about a story is that it can be told in all sorts of lengths.==========There is a time in every man`s education when he arrives at the convication that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of gold, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till.The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.

==========What would be absotively magnificent? —A one‑of‑a‑kind kind of day.==========Time is that which God uses to separate the idle from the industrious.

What with its towers made of granite and all the miles of pavement stretching as far as the eye can see. Why, every single day, millions of people went pounding along the sidewalks and across the marble‑ floored lobbies without even putting a dent in them. To make matters worse, Manhattan was absotively filled with expectations. There were so many expectations, they had to build the buildings eighty stories high so they would have enough room to stack them one on top of the other.==========What a strange and beautiful sight, thought Woolly. The city of New York silent, motionless, and virtually uninhabited, sitting perfectly idle, without the hum of a single expectation for the very first time since its founding.==========—Took a chance?

Emmett has to tie up his late father’s estate, and then he and his little brother Billy will be leaving town for a fresh start in life.Emmett and Billy have different ideas about which direction they should head - Billy wants to follow the Lincoln Highway, where their mother, (who walked out on the family many years ago) is thought to be living. Emmett wants to follow wherever the work is, however, much to Emmett’s surprise, Duchess and Wooly, who are still supposed to be serving time in the facility where Emmett was, have managed to secrete themselves in the trunk of Warden William’s car, and are intent on a road trip of their own! What follows is madness and mayhem, but what a journey!What an inventive and absorbing read this is. The characters are wonderful - all memorable in their own special way, the storyline is just an escapade full of humour and joy, not to mention some moving scenes thrown in for good measure. Can’t praise it enough!*Thank you to Netgalley and Random House UK Cornerstone for an arc in exchange for an honest unbiased review*"
634,5.0,"I’ve been writing short reviews these last couple of months, but I knew at some point a book would come along and I’d be compelled to say more about it than just a few sentences.********I thought I was going on an adventure across the country on the Lincoln Highway, but I found myself on a journey of the heart with these characters, looking for “fresh starts “, each of them discovering who they are, how they fit into this world, each one having been abandoned in one way or another, each one rising up to meet their fate, trying to make amends. They don’t actually cross the country from New York to California in 1954, but take a detour from farm country in Nebraska to New York City (and what an ode to New York City ! ). Three teenage boys, one just released from a juvenile work farm, two who have escaped, are flawed and well meaning, trying to do the right thing. And oh my heart, the eight year old brother of the first boy, who is precocious, yet sweet in his naïveté and belief in heroes. It’s about heroes, too, not just the ones in the book that Billy carries with him, but these unforgettable characters who are heroes in their own right to each other in some way, along with some other characters who I was touched by. I loved everything about this novel - the seamless way that Towles takes his readers to a time and place, the way he bridges that connection between fiction and life. He’s an extraordinary storyteller. Despite its length, I didn’t want it to end, didn’t want to leave these characters whose journeys reflect love and friendship, sadness and joy and are filled with the stuff that life is made of. As always a pleasure to read with Diane and Esil."
635,5.0,"Amor Towles spins a beguiling and rollicking historical adventure set in the 1950s, brilliantly imaginative, and with an unforgettable cast of characters, ostensibly about a Lincoln Highway road trip to California that keeps gets derailed. 18 year old Emmet Watson is a surprisingly composed and mature young man, who arrives back home to Morgen, Nebraska, after serving a sentence for involuntary manslaughter at a juvenile work farm in Salina. His unsuccessful farmer father has died, debts mean their family farm has been foreclosed upon by the bank. None of this is a shock to Emmet, he has planned for new beginnings, to pick up his 8 year old brother, Billy, driving in his 1948 Studebaker, to start a more secure future in California, where it appears their mother went after abandoning them years ago. However, two of his friends, Duchess and Wooley, from Salena have escaped, hiding in the car that Emmet was driven home in by the warden, and they have other more immediate ideas of going to New York. Duchess is a good, if frustrating, man, but his ideas and misguided good intentions fail to take account of the consequences of his actions, he seeks to balance the scales of justice in his life, which includes taking a beating that he feels he deserves. Wooley is a dreamer, out of sync with the world and his wealthy family's expectations, requiring medication for his condition, looking for a one of a kind day rather than the normal every day kind of days, he has access to money that could set all of them for the new lives they all dream of. So begin a series of adventures, where Billy's precious book, Professor Abernathe's Compendium is key, including a thrilling freight train journey to New York, taking in a circus, the Empire State Building and so much more.They encounter a memorable set of characters on their oddyssey, including the Great Ulysses in search of his wife and child, a villainous Pastor John, Wooley's sister, Sarah, and are joined by the remarkable Sally from Nebraska. Towles vibrant storytelling is spellbinding, oozing with a sense of magical wonder, with its echoes of ancient myths, legends and heroes, brought to life in 1950s America. This is a beautiful, multilayered read, of life, brothers, love, friendship, the spirit of adventure, misfits that a world struggles to accommodate, and the heartbreak of tragedy. I adored young Billy, wise beyond his years, with his heart of gold and simplicity that cuts through what might be thought of as logical and normal. A superb novel that I recommend highly, a wonderful must read. Many thanks to the publisher for an ARC."
636,3.0,"Audiobook….read by Edoardo Ballerini, Marin Ireland, Dion Graham  …..16 hours and 39 minutes Being a… ….HUGE FAN of “A Gentleman in Moscow” and “Rules of Civility”…I was excited as any other fan to dive into Towles third novel. However … “The Lincoln Highway” wasn’t my cup of tea. Great beginning…But….as the story moved along, the adventures and stories grew tiresome to me. I grew tired of Billy’s young voice. His zealous fervent perky-curiosity became annoying and laborious to me.I wasn’t a fan of many of the devious-clownish characters. I didn’t care for theatrical stories of Hercules, Galileo, Edison, or other imperial dramaturgic tales. I didn’t want a Shakespeare lesson —I had no interest in the sailboat stories…or…Heroes of legendsSorcery and enchantment intervention of the Gods …or…Toys in FOA Schwarz….or…lessons on how to make strawberry jam or pie…I didn’t mesh with some of the quirkiness-‘words-of- wisdom’ slants…Example:  “When a piano falls out of the window and lands on a persons head there’s a good chance he’ll understand why he deserved it”. Plenty of repetitiveness, too. How many times did I need to hear about the nine postcards? Sometimes I felt that had Towles written this as a middle school children’s book -it could have been brilliant- but as an adult book mixed with childish stories - it just didn’t work for me. I didn’t care for the mischievous humor-satire-ish-thriller-ish….book that this was. That said… Amor Towles is an eloquent -talented writer/storyteller. I admire him - and seriously loved his past two novels. “The Lincoln Highway” had powerful underline messages about human behaviors which were heartfelt— but the adventurous-packaging that they came in was too fatiguing to me. 2 star-personal enjoyment….(I don’t like sour cream either), — so this is just a personal preference review….not a slam on the author whatsoever. 4 stars for Amor Towles eloquent skills.Rounding out my final rating to 3 stars."
637,5.0,"Still catching up on books I finished this spring. My apologies. THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY is a gem. I adored Amor Towles's first two novels, and I savored every moment of this one. It's 1954, and three young men and a boy are on the adventure of their lives, traveling between the Midwest and Manhattan and the Adirondacks, and while there are meticulous reasons for their incredible journey, what makes this masterpiece work are each of the characters. They have their scars and their demons and their eccentricities. Two you will want to take under your wing and adopt; one will leave you uneasy; and one just might have in him the stuff of heroism. All of them you will care about deeply. I savored this book: every page. "
638,3.0,"holy cow. this roadtrip is a nightmare. everything that can go wrong, does. all because of duchess, who is one of the most unenjoyable characters to read about in the history of books. and honestly, this is probably closer to a 2 star read, but the relationship between emmett and his younger brother, billy, deserves so much better than that. and its such a tremendous shame that too many other POVs take away from this amazing brotherly bond. i found nearly every character POV, other than emmetts, to be lacking and begging to be skimmed. with the exception of duchess and sometimes woolly, whose POVs do progress the plot, every other POV could be cut from the story without consequence. sure, they add some side stories but, for me, they just took away page time that could have been better spent on emmett and billy. the removal of these very distant side characters also would have helped with the long length and slow pacing. but gosh. again, i keep going back and thinking about emmett and billy. their connection is just too wholesome. i love their dynamic - emmetts cautious protection and billy innocent affection. they both steal whatever scene they are in and truly outshine all of the other characters. i easily could have read 600+ pages of just them and given it 5 stars. this also has some really great writing and storytelling with quintessential AT charm throughout. so its a shame that the story is bogged down by unlikeable and unnecessary characters. ↠ 3 stars"
639,5.0,"A madcap adventure story, a fantastical story set in the fifties, a story about retribution, forgiveness missed connections, and peopled with some outstanding characters. An ode to reading, travel and the family we have, the family we make. Towels has the talent to entertain with his scenarios, to pull a reader into a time period, a situation, to make the unbelievable, believable and to entertain so well that almost 600 pages just flyby. These are characters that one doesn't easily forget, even what one would call minor characters are central to the plot. One in particular is very young, Billy, but at times it seems he has more belief and wisdom than his elders. I'm not quite sure I understand the ending but I intend soon to go back and re-read, and discussing with Angela and Esil will I'm sure aid in my endeavor. Another unforgettable story from Towles."
640,5.0,"It’s June 12th 1954 and Warden Williams is taking eighteen year old Emmett Watson home from Salina, a juvenile reform program after which Emmett’s debt to society is paid in full. His father has died, his bank loans against it are called in and the farm is to be sold. His eight year old brother Billy shows him a map of the Lincoln Highway stretching east to west, their intention is to drive Emmett's 1948 Studebaker Land Cruiser westwards to San Francisco. However, best laid plans and all that, when everything is thrown up in the air by the unexpected arrival of Duchess and Woolly from Salina. What transpires over the next ten days is very far from what the Watson brothers imagine especially as it becomes clear that Duchess and Emmett are on a collision course. The story is told from multiple points of view. What an adventure! It is no surprise that this is brilliantly written, it’s extremely creative, imaginative and so vivid. The characters are superbly crafted, they feel authentic and real and whilst three of them have erred there is an elegant yet simple morality to them , with Emmett being an especially good man. Billy for me is the stand out character, I just fall in love with his thoughtful yet simple approach to life, his sweetness, wisdom and intelligence and particularly how he is inspired and guided by Professor Abacus Abernathe’s Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers and other Intrepid Travellers. This is a key component of the novel and a great deal mirrors the compendium with a sense of it being prophetic. There ARE heroes, certainly adventurers, they meet intrepid travellers and on more than one occasion the book saves Billy and the rest of them. Their journey deviates, as does the storytelling but it does take you to some magical and fantastical places. At times the book is funny, at others it makes you uneasy and has shocks and surprises along the way. As the story meanders east before heading west ( you’ll have to read the book to find out why 😁) on occasions it feels like a madcap movie like a Chaplin or Keaton silent film caper which incidentally are mentioned in passing(!) with these scenes being especially delicious!! The dialogue is ‘absotively’ brilliant making you want to join in. As it reaches a conclusion it takes a darker turn, which I guess has been in the cards with the signs there for all to see. Overall, I think this is an excellent and original novel. The storytelling is lively, engaging, takes the reader on a wild ride as it twists and turns away from the brothers original intention and into some lively and unexpected situations. It’s a character driven study with all the facets of humankind on display, the good, the bad and the endearingly wonderful. With thanks to NetGalley and Random House UK, Cornerstone for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review."
641,3.0,"It is hard for me to rate this book because I loved the first third and was extremely disappointed by the rest. While listening to the first 30% of this book I was so enamored with the writing and the characters I was sure that this novel was going to be my favorite book of the year. Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to be. As soon as the boys hit the road toward the Lincoln Highway Amor Towles' brain was taken over by a much lesser writer who specializes in stories for teenage boys and loves tangents. Many new characters are introduced, none of whom grabbed my interest. The story lost momentum and I began to skip the chapters which were not narrated by the 2 main protagonists and Sally. I loved Sally. She had some of the best lines. After praying to God for months that her father will marry the woman he is dating and therefore have someone other than herself responsible for cooking and cleaning for him she is sorely disappointed when they stop dating. And she quips: ""They say the lord answers all prayers ....but sometimes he answers 'no.'"" I was shocked by the ending. Where did that come from? It changed the tone of the book from folksy, old fashioned story telling to... well, telling would be a spoiler. I loved Rules of Civility but nothing of Towles' since, including A Gentleman from Moscow. I know. I know. I tried to read it twice but it never captured my attention. I was definitely in the minority on ""Gentlemen"" just as I seem to be in the minority on The Lincoln Highway. "
642,5.0,"I can’t tell you how excited I was that Amor Towles came out with a new book! And it’s a road trip!!The historic Lincoln HighwayIt's 1954, and 18 year old Emmett Watson has just finished serving time at a Kansas juvenile work farm for accidentally killing a boy who was bullying him. His mother abandoned their family years ago, and his father, a man haunted by his failure at farming, has just died, and the bank is poised to foreclose. Emmett doesn't mind losing his home because he's got a plan: pack up his 8 y.o. brother Billy and start a new life in Texas. But ""California,"" says Billy, certain that's where their long-lost mother is living. They can drive the Lincoln Highway to San Francisco and be there by the 4th of July.But as it turns out, neither Texas nor California is in their immediate future. Two of Emmett's friend from the work farm, Duchess and Woolly, broke out of the facility early and propose going the opposite way, to New York City, where Woolly's large inheritance is hidden in a family safe. If Emmett takes them there, Woolly will split the cash between the four of them. Emmett is determined to stay on the right side of the law and wants nothing to do with this plan, but things happen. Well, mostly Duchess — a clever, charming and utterly self-centered young man — happens. Duchess and Woolly take off to New York with Emmett's car (not to mention Emmett's cash hidden in the trunk), and Emmett, now destitute, decides to chase them down the only way he can think of. He and Billy stow away in an empty car of a freight train heading to New York City. Their adventure is just beginning.The Lincoln Highway is one of those books that got better and better the further I got into it. Amor Towles' (author of A Gentleman in Moscow) take on mid-20th century road trip is given such an original twist here, and Towles' gift for writing shines through and takes this novel to a whole new level. The boys' adventures are related with sympathy and insight.- Questions can be so tricky, he said, like forks in the road. You can be having such a nice conversation and someone will raise a question, and the next thing you know you’re headed off in a whole new direction. In all probability, this new road will lead you to places that are perfectly agreeable, but sometimes you just want to go in the direction you were already headed.The characters are also fascinating (with the possible exception of Woolly, who never felt quite real for me). I especially like — and hated — Duchess, an unreliable narrator whose charming exterior hides a darker core, and I loved Billy, a bright and occasionally unworldly boy (I think he may be on the moderate side of the spectrum, though it's never explicitly said).One of my favorite subplots of the book involves Billy's favorite book, Professor Abacus Abernathe's Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers and Other Intrepid Travelers. When Billy meets a black wanderer named Ulysses, it feels fateful, and Billy's love for literature and faith in Ulysses' story help change the paths of several lives, including that of the book's author.He too had watched as the outer limits of his life had narrowed from the world at large, to the island of Manhattan, to that book-lined office in which he awaited with a philosophical resignation the closing of the finger and thumb. And then this . . . This! This extraordinary turn of events.A little boy from Nebraska appears at his doorstep with a gentle demeanor and a fantastical tale. A tale not from a leather-bound tome, mind you . . . But from life itself. How easily we forget—we in the business of storytelling — that life was the point all along.Highly recommended!Bonus material: Towles talks about this book here on his website and gives some fascinating insights into the plot, why he chose this particular time in history for the setting, and the book's structure, including the reason why the book's sections count down for each day rather than usual method of counting up.Original post: I'm very proud of myself for catching this one on my library's online catalog before it was even on the shelf and putting in a hold. It's now in my hands! Hoping I'll love it as much as I did A Gentleman in Moscow."

644,5.0,"’...for most people, it doesn’t matter where they live. When they get up in the morning, they’re not looking to change the world. They want to have a cup of coffee and a piece of toast, put in their eight hours, and wrap up the day with a bottle of beer in front of the TV set. More of less, it’s what they’d be doing whether they lived in Atlanta, Georgia, or Nome, Alaska. And if it doesn’t matter for most people where they live, it certainly doesn’t matter where they’re going.That’s what gave the Lincoln Highway its charm.When you see the highway on a map, it looks like that Fisher guy Billy was talking about took a ruler and drew a line straight across the country, mountains and rivers be damned. In so doing, he must have imagined it would provide a timely conduit for the movement of goods and ideas from sea to shining sea, in a final fulfillment of manifest destiny. But everyone we passed just seemed to have a satisfied sense of their own lack of purpose.Let the road rise up to meet you, say the Irish, and that’s what was happening to the intrepid travelers on the Lincoln Highway. It was rising up to meet each and every one of them, whether they were headed east, headed west, or going around in circles.’The Lincoln Highway reads like one of those long Sunday drives wandering here and there without a specific destination in mind, wandering to and fro... Until, that is, all the back roads it follows lead to one road which was your fate. Like The Long and Winding Road which leads to your door, the place where you end up even when it wasn’t your destination, but more like your destiny. It floats along, and we’re glad to be a part of the journey, even if we are only silently observing these characters, and the journeys - both physical and emotional - they are on. It has the adventure of Tom Sawyer, and the charm, as well as the relative innocence associated with the era which makes for a delicious combination. A sense of an almost magical journey that offers a wistfulness that gives a nod to that There’s no place like home essence of Dorothy’s journey, including the flying monkeys, with the wicked witch replaced by other nefarious characters in search of this story’s version of the ruby slippers, with the charm of Dorothy’s crew of the Cowardly Lion, Scarecrow and the Tin Man being found in the characters in the journey of The Lincoln Highway. Courage, heart and brains make up the ingredients for the magical spell this casts. Throw in a sprinkling of a few Marx brothers type moments for some laughs, as well. What made this seem both charming and believable was the sense of love, forgiveness and a hopeful confidence that the journey they embark on will come true, that sense of hope is at the heart of it all. A sense of believing in all those seemingly trite sayings that still seem to hold a ring of truth. Most of the characters in this, and there are many, seem imbued with that old school confidence and quirky charm, although there are exceptions. In order to appreciate the goodness of life, and protect it, we have to remember that there are others who would steal it, given the chance. A tale not from a leather bound tome, mind you. Not from an epic poem written in an unspoken language. Not from an archive or athenaeum. But from life itself.How easily we forget---we in the business of storytelling---that life was the point all along. A mother who has vanished, a father who has failed, a brother who is determined. A journey from the prairies into the city by means of a boxcar with a vagabond named Ulysses. Then to a railroad track suspended over the city as surely as Valhalla is suspended in the clouds."
645,3.0,"Choo choo choo! That’s the sound of my disappointment train which suddenly left the town. With this ominous cue you may sense some very unpopular review is on its way!  I’m not sure if it’s about my changing literary taste or dark winter mood, but lately I start showing less interest to highly appraised and five starred books! After seeing those high recommendations, I thought I would absolutely love this book from the author of Gentleman in Moscow! I have to admit: the beginning was so promising and gripping which made me think I found another five starred gem but… till the characters hit the road, everything has changed, things got repetitive, new characters were thrown into equation and I didn’t like them much. Actually I showed no interest to learn more about their stories. And that ending….should I say disappointed, abrupt, empty… I don’t know what adjective I may use to define the ending without giving spoilers.  I think I was expecting something more than reading a story about teenage boys and tangerine obsession.  The beginning was impressive. In 1954, at a juvenile work farm, Emmett Watson who served for fifteen months because of manslaughter is getting to be driven to his house in Nebraska. His father passed away and his mother is long gone so only he and his eight years old brother left. The bank is already planning to take over the family farm. So at young age, his plan to have fresh start is driving to California with his brother Billy. But unfortunately the warden’s car which will take him to his home is already taken over by two friends at friend and now they are both headed to Big Apple . After that point the story’s direction absolutely changed. And I didn’t enjoy it! Well, of course I’m not gonna give two stars !I really don’t want to get booed! ( it happened to me when I wrote my unpopular review to Cloud Cuckoo Land) I’m giving my solid three stars! I was expecting so much more but actually this book was definitely not for me!"
646,4.0,"[3.7] A meandering, long-winded adventure with too many side stories. But the characters, especially Emmett and Billy, kept me reading. The novel moves along at a steady clip and I mostly enjoyed the ride. For me, The Lincoln HIghway falls in the middle of the three Towles' novels - better paced than A Gentleman from Moscow but disappointing compared to The Rules of Civility."
647,3.0,"I was really looking forward to this one following the excellent ‘Gentleman in Moscow’ but unfortunately it failed to grip me in the same way. Undoubtedly well written but I felt it generally dragged and failed to engage me. I have read many reviews that contradict my review but at the end of the day it is my personal opinion and nothing else.In June 1954, eighteen year old Emmett Watson is driven home to Nebraska by the warden of the juvenile work farm where he served fifteen months for involuntary manslaughter. His father has recently died and his mother left a long time ago so the family farm is about to be taken over by the bank. Emmett plans to head for California to start a new life with his eight year old brother Billy. Once the warden drives off, Emmett discovers that two friends from the farm have stowed away in the warden’s car and have very different plans regarding Emmett’s future. Together the four travel in the opposite direction and head for New York.Well written but too slow and unengaging.I would like to thank both Net Galey and Random House for supplying a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review."
648,4.0,"Mixed feelings…There’s no question that Amor Towles is a very talented storyteller, however, this novel has reminded me of a quote from the story…“If you take a trait that by all appearances is a merit—a trait that is praised by pastors and poets, a trait that we have come to admire in our friends and hope to foster in our children—and you give it to some poor soul in abundance, it will almost certainly prove an obstacle to their happiness. Just as someone can be too smart for their own good, there are those who are too patient for their own good, or too hardworking.”This is about how I’m feeling. Towles is too good a writer for his own good in this one. It was well written, but overly written. There were too many unnecessary characters and too many philosophical moments. I’m still trying to figure out why all the characters? What purpose did they serve? Why include them as narrators only to leave their stories undeveloped. I, actually, think this would have been a great series. There were certainly enough interesting characters and side stories to work with. I wanted this to have stayed focused on the boys and less on the supporting characters. The ending, also, left me a lil disappointed… Wooly? He deserved more from the boys & I really didn’t buy their reactions. Overall, I enjoyed the adventure these boys took me on, but I think if it had been condensed, less wordy & with a smaller cast of characters, I would’ve enjoyed it a lot more. Listened to this on audio which was multi-narrated & very well done. 3.5 stars rounded up for the narration."
649,5.0,"Emmett Watson was honest and straight-forward, but he did have a bit of a temper. His younger brother, Billy had convinced him to count to ten before he let his anger get the better of him. Emmett wished he knew about this before he let Jimmy Synder goad him into getting so mad that he swung without thinking and hit him so hard he fell back and hit his head on a cinderblock holding down a tentpole. Jack laid in the hospital a whole week before he died, and Emmett knew he’d have to pay the consequences. They called it involuntary manslaughter and since he was under eighteen, they sent him to the juvenile work farm in Salina, Kansas for eighteen months. Now the warden was driving him back to the family farm in Nebraska, to close out the foreclosure papers on his father’s farm and take care of young Billy. Mr. Ransom from the next farm over suggested it might be best for Emmett and Billy to move on and start over somewhere new. Emmett already thought that over and was keen to set out the next day and head for Texas where he could put the carpentry skills he learned on the job since he was sixteen. Billy had his heart set on heading to California since he found nine old postcards their mother had sent years ago when she left the farm saying that’s where she ended up. Emmett figured either way they were leaving in the morning until he saw two figures in the old barn. Duchess Hewitt and Woolly Martin were standing next to his car but were supposed to be back at the work farm. Emmett was not happy to see them here in Nebraska. They had hid in the warden’s car trunk for the three-hour drive to the Watson farm for their escape and wanted Emmett to join them on a trip to Woolly’s grandfather’s house in upstate, New York. Woolly told Duchess that his Grandfather had put his inheritance, in cash in the total of one hundred fifty thousand dollars in his safe, in that house. Woolly said they can get it and split it three ways. Emmett had a car, but he also had his younger brother Billy, so he said he’d take them to a bus or train station, but he wasn’t going. Well, Duchess, having grown up with a thieving alcoholic dad who dropped him off at an orphanage when he was 8 years old, was used to getting by and spinning slick tales with his sly tongue. Woolly, raised in wealth and privilege, was a simple, kind-hearted soul who wanted to please everyone, would go along with whatever was decided. The group did set out with the plans mentioned just above, but of course that’s not what happened at all. Let’s say they had a few detours on the way, some with Duchess ‘borrowing’ Emmett’s car, and some with hopping trains. You see, it was Billy’s idea to follow the Lincoln Highway all the way out to California to find their mother, convinced they’d find her still in San Francisco nine years later. Billy even had maps where he plotted all the stops their mom had made shown in her postcards. Emmett figured he could work in California just as well as Texas, but finding their mother, well he’d cross that bridge when they got there.The adventure that you’re about to take is well worth your time, plus you’ll meet some interesting characters along the way. And trust me, none of it is predictable, but all of it is eye-opening. Remember, the time period is June 1954, Emmett and Billy want to get to California by July fourth because their mother loved fireworks. (And I left out Billy’s bid red book with tales of heroes; oh, you’ll see.)Thank you Netgalley and Edelweiss, Penguin Random House - Viking, and Amor Towles"
650,4.0,"What do I say about this book? It contains a little bit of everything; drama, comedy, irony, mythology, red herrings, mystery, throw in a little bit of magic, and a large and very wonderful cast of characters. The four main ones: Emmett, the dependable guy everyone can depend on.Duchess, a wild card capable of anything. Wooley, the wisest slow-witted fellow you've ever met. And 8 year old Billy, no words to describe how intelligent and intuitive and kind he was, and in my opinion, the originator of all the action in this novel.Then there were the special peripheral characters. Sally, Ulysses, Professor Abacus Abernatheand his Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers, and Other Intrepid Travelers, and many others too numerous to mention.This is a road trip novel, and veers off into detours and side trips and takes us all over the place and into all sorts of situations. A lot of reviews complain about this fact and some readers give up entirely. All I can say is just put yourself in the capable hands of Amor Towles, ride along, and trust him to take you on a one-of-a-kind adventure. You'll be glad you persevered."
651,3.0,"3.5I've finally finished this overly long book.It was a readable novel, especially since I had Eduardo Ballerini read it to me (for the most part, Marin Ireland and Dion Graham come on board for some minutes). When eighteen-year-old Emmett returns home to Nebraska, after serving some time in juvenile detention, he becomes the guardian of his eight-year-old brother, Billy, as their father had passed away and their mum had left them all some years back.Upon discovering some old postcards sent by their mum, they conclude that she must be in San Francisco. With the bank foreclosing on the family home, Emmett and Billy decide to take the Lincoln Highway all the way to San Francisco.Their plans take a detour, as two pals from juvie show up at the boys' home. Duchess and Wooley are two very different characters. They plan to go to Wooley's family holiday home to retrieve a big amount of money left in the safe. When Duchess and Wooley take off to New York with Emmett's truck, the siblings take a freight train to New York to recover their truck.All sorts of mishaps and adventures happen while on the train and when in New York. Duchess is one sleek, slippery character. There were sweet moments here and there, particularly when Billy was involved. But I don't know, this novel felt kind of directionless and I wasn't particularly taken with the ending either.(view spoiler)[I am disappointed with how the author dealt with Duchess and Wooley. Especially when it came to Wooley, his demise was quickly brushed over in a very casual way. (hide spoiler)] At over 16 hrs long or 576 pages, this novel had too much padding and too many side stories. I never felt emotionally engaged and it felt like I was riding in a car to nowhere."
652,3.0,"This book had a promising beginning when 18 year old Emmett Watson returns from serving time for involuntary manslaughter. His parents are dead and the family farm is lost, so Emmett and his 8 year old brother Billy decide to set off to California to start new lives. That promising beginning crashed and burned a few chapters later when Duchess and Woolly, 2 friends from the work farm, turned up to complicate Emmett’s plans. The book devolved into a picaresque tale without a single believable character. Everyone acted and sounded older than their age. Sally, the only significant female character, was added to the book for no reason that I could discern. The story changed point of view in each chapter so that each character, including a few who appeared only briefly, got to explain his or her story. It felt disjointed. The book was 300 pages too long. Maybe the author was aiming for a fable and he tacked on a serious ending, which I hated. I can’t believe Towles wrote this. Very disappointing. "
653,5.0,"I loved Amor Towles previous novels and I am delighted that this is another five-star read. It features eighteen-year-old Emmett, who returns home from a sentence for inadvertently killing a young man at the local country fair. Greeted with delight by his young brother Billy, and neighbour Sally, he is less thrilled that two young men from the work farm have hitched a lift with Warden Williams. Duchess is the son of a vaudeville performer and Woolly is from a wealthy family but was never a natural fit and his family now have authority over his trust fund.Emmett has none of those issues. His father left nothing, but debts and the family farm has been foreclosed. Indeed, the banker is waiting for Emmett on his return and all that he has left is his powder blue 1948 Studebaker Land Cruiser. With locals having long memories, Emmett decides to head out on a road trip and make a new life. He didn’t count on Duchess and Woolly coming along, nor for the host of other characters they will meet along the way.Without doubt, this is an excellent portrait of 1950’s America, with Towles painting a realistic view of life at that time. The characters all have depth and I think readers may well find young Billy a favourite, with his big red book, “Professor Abacus Abernathe’s Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers and Other Intrepid Travellers,” which will provide lots of links throughout the story. Overall, though, this is a delight, containing deep themes, which will appeal to book groups, a unique cast of characters, troubled young men, friendship and is, in many ways, the classic tale of young people making their way in the world without adults to guide them and a whole host of unforeseen circumstances that will make their journey a memorable, but bumpy one.I received a copy of this book from the publisher, via NetGalley, for review. "
654,3.0,"2.75 starsAll aboooooooard! There is a love train for this book and it's filling up fast. That train will be leaving the station without me. Amor Towles is a gifted storyteller. The trouble here was that he couldn't seem to decide which story he wanted to tell. So he told them all. In one novel. What it felt like to me was that he knew a lot of odd and eccentric things about the early to mid-20th century, and he wanted to find a way to include them all in the book. So we get digression after digression as we are introduced to a parade of peripheral characters and their life histories. This would have been a much better novel if it were more focused, and if Emmett and Billy had actually driven to California as planned."
655,5.0,"In college a common exam question would be “Compare and Contrast”. We would often insert that phrase in conversation to mock our Professors. The phrase came to mind as I read this book. The obvious comparison is to the author’s other great novel “A Gentleman in Moscow”. The character development and the philosophical musings are similar. But a book I read earlier this year is the one I kept thinking about. “This Tender Land” by William Kent Krueger also featured 4 orphans, including a pair of brothers, on a road trip. There was a character named Ulysses, and also the character Billy from this book seemed to share a sixth sense with Emmy in Tender Land. Instead of a Studebaker and The Lincoln Highway they traveled by canoe on the Minnesota river.Unlike the other two books this one has alternating chapters from the point of view of different characters. This is a method that is bothersome at times, but here it works well. These are a distinct set of interesting and unique characters, each with their own peculiar voice.Where in A Gentleman in Moscow all the action takes place in one building this story spans half a continent. Also in this book readers will follow multiple characters instead just The Count and Sofia.This book also has several philosophical musings by characters similar to those by the Count in A Gentleman in Moscow. Sally relates the story of Jesus dismissing the complaint by Martha over her sister Mary’s idleness. She then tells about how much effort and time it takes to make a homemade Apple Pie. After setting a slice of the pie in front of her father, he gulps down half of it and continues his conversation without a word of thanks. This parable also represents Sally’s conflicted relationship with Emmett. She closes that story with a classic quote:For kindness begins where necessity ends. (Page 104).Readers who were satisfied with the ending in A Gentleman in Moscow should be satisfied with this ending. They will also enjoy the hilarious encounter that Woolly has with a Dictionary and Thesaurus. They will enjoy the characters of Professor Abacus Abernathe and Ulysses.A Gentleman in Moscow will always be a special book for me, and to compare this book with it and A Tender Land puts it in fine company. This book was every bit as good as A Gentleman in Moscow and will be the best work of fiction I will have read this year. Only one other friend has read it so far and she gave it 5 stars but did not review it. A Gentleman in Moscow was a popular and well-read book. I am looking forward to seeing how this book ranks with readers. I will be reading lots of reviews in order to “Compare and Contrast.”"
656,3.0,"Click here to hear my thoughts on this book over on my Booktube channel, abookolive.The third novel from wildly popular author Amor Towles tells the story of three young men and one boy in America’s heartland making their way to New York - all seeking different outcomes from the journey. This one is likely to appeal to readers of A Gentleman in Moscow because of the focus on characters over plot, but it’s ultimately too long and uneven."
657,5.0,Terrific! Review TK
658,4.0,"*3.5 stars rounded up. I think my expectations were a little too high for this new book by Amor Towles, a favorite author. I expected that it would be a road trip, an odyssey of sorts, along the famous Lincoln Highway. Seems reasonable since that is the title. And it started out that way with Emmett Watson and his little brother Billy piling into Emmett's Studebaker and leaving their hometown in rural Nebraska behind in the dust with plans to reach San Francisco by the 4th of July, 1954. But they have two other passengers in the car, one of whom has different plans, and their trip goes off the rails almost immediately. This is an exciting adventure story filled with thrills and chills and eccentric characters but it could oddly be a bit dull and repetitive at times. Certain scenes were repeated from another character's point of view and that often seemed unnecessary and slowed the plot. It's intriguing that Towles uses first person pov with some characters; I assume to better reveal their motivations and internal dialogue. But I have to ask why quotation marks were eschewed for dashes? It worked for the most part but could occasionally be confusing. Lack of quotation mark usage happens to be a pet peeve of mine--okay, so it's the English teacher in me, lol. One character agrees with me and actually discusses the importance of punctuation for ease in understanding meaning. Yes!!The last 20% of the book is 'edge of the seat' reading with a really satisfying ending. That, plus some truly wonderful characterizations, brought my rating up to 4 stars. But I would have really enjoyed a road trip on the Lincoln Highway across 50s America, sigh. Sequel? I received an arc of this novel from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks for the opportunity."
659,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this novel - so grand in scope, a kind of tribute to American classic larger than life characters in fiction, the down and out hero stories baked into quite the loaf. It’s a rollicking story - so MANY tales embedded - so many people - so many allusions to the power of myths: those of the Greeks like Ulysses, Jason, Achilles, the morality of the biblical with a dash of reverence to earlier inventors. Heady stuff for the young heroes of this travelling troop as they start, stop and pivot on their most unlikely journey. Early in the novel, the serious Emmett ponders, “Wasn’t it hard enough in the course of life to distinguish between fact and fancy, between what one witnessed and what one wanted?” To some degree, the novel itself veers off so fancifully that I did a fair bit of eye-rolling- except that Towles was giving me such a good time that I simply rode along, on the road and the rails, with Billy, Duchess, Woolly and Emmett, and let go of the expectations which I’d had for the author’s earlier thoughtful, more intimate style. I continually felt as though I had read this book, in pieces and parts, elsewhere. Of course, Canterbury Tales did spring to mind, as our heroes met up with, collected and had the “tales” of others’ shared- some bleak, some naughty, some fraught with vice and times of great kindness. Fanny Flagg invites great comparison, with her down home style, moral compass and ability to frame the nostalgia with a degree of bite. This Tender Land by William Kent Krueger is somewhat reminiscent- except that the school setting of the children caused me to ache bitterly; I never quite did develop as much empathy for Lincoln Highway’s group, though I knew that they were as deserving - it just took SO LONG to find those kernels here. At nearly 600 pages, this is an investment - one which does mostly chug along, and it certainly motivated me to read almost nonstop - sometimes skimming over the diversions which conman Duchess kept putting me through, flowery language ad infinitum- to get back to the main plot.

Four strong stars. "
660,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about this novel - so grand in scope, a kind of tribute to American classic larger than life characters in fiction, the down and out hero stories baked into quite the loaf. It’s a rollicking story - so MANY tales embedded - so many people - so many allusions to the power of myths: those of the Greeks like Ulysses, Jason, Achilles, the morality of the biblical with a dash of reverence to earlier inventors. Heady stuff for the young heroes of this travelling troop as they start, stop and pivot on their most unlikely journey. Early in the novel, the serious Emmett ponders, “Wasn’t it hard enough in the course of life to distinguish between fact and fancy, between what one witnessed and what one wanted?” To some degree, the novel itself veers off so fancifully that I did a fair bit of eye-rolling- except that Towles was giving me such a good time that I simply rode along, on the road and the rails, with Billy, Duchess, Woolly and Emmett, and let go of the expectations which I’d had for the author’s earlier thoughtful, more intimate style. I continually felt as though I had read this book, in pieces and parts, elsewhere. Of course, Canterbury Tales did spring to mind, as our heroes met up with, collected and had the “tales” of others’ shared- some bleak, some naughty, some fraught with vice and times of great kindness. Fanny Flagg invites great comparison, with her down home style, moral compass and ability to frame the nostalgia with a degree of bite. This Tender Land by William Kent Krueger is somewhat reminiscent- except that the school setting of the children caused me to ache bitterly; I never quite did develop as much empathy for Lincoln Highway’s group, though I knew that they were as deserving - it just took SO LONG to find those kernels here. At nearly 600 pages, this is an investment - one which does mostly chug along, and it certainly motivated me to read almost nonstop - sometimes skimming over the diversions which conman Duchess kept putting me through, flowery language ad infinitum- to get back to the main plot. I’ll admit that if this hadn’t been written by Amor Towles, I mightn’t have been as patient - but his knowledge is encyclopedic, literary skills magnificent and for that he can never be faulted. Four strong stars. "
661,5.0,"I have hesitated writing this review because so many beautiful reviews have been written about this book.What could I add? And so, as I pondered I realized the very best thought I could share with you is that I look forward to the day when I will read it again. In the meantime the characters are tucked deeply in my heart.The storyline continues to sneak into my day capturing my thoughts with its adventure,romance,suspense,and history. Oh, i loved it so! I did not want it to come to an end. So now my friends,perhaps you can understand why I am happy that it will occupy a shelf in my library. Just to see it out of the corner of my eye will make me warm inside...and yes, I know that it is waiting there for me to open and be swept away into my beloved world of Amor Towles Lincoln Highway once more."
662,5.0,"At 500+ pages in the hardcover, and 16+ hours on the audiobook, how is it possible that upon finishing this, I was sad to not have more to look forward to. I wanted to know more about these adventuresome characters and continue on their next journey along the Lincoln Highway. Not that the story delved very deeply at all into what lies along the coast-to-coast highway for which it is named. Instead it sinks us into the young lives of these misfits as they try to start afresh in the 1950s. And not to imply either that the book is lacking in any way, shape, or form. It's really perfection. I expect, and I get, nothing less from him, every time."
663,4.0,"""It was a way of life in which the difference between abundance and ruin could be measured by a few inches of rain or a few nights of frost.""Or by an impulsive reaction or an ill-thought out plan or an association with someone untrustworthy...or...or...or. ""To free you from your guilt through atonement and from your indignation through forgiveness.

Ever followed your trusty GPS into unknown territory, only to find yourself looking at your surroundings with skepticism and distrust? Ever traveled the back roads only to discover there was a far more direct route to your destination, once you arrived? Raises hand. This book reads like a navigation system with a wicked sense of humor. It meandered, took side trips, careened down forks in the road as you pointed in the other direction, and barely missed speeding trains at the crossing. I found the language reminiscent of A Gentleman in Moscow, which I loved, and I enjoyed it yet again. (Yes, I know it didn't fit with the age of the characters and I just didn't care. It was exquisite and brilliant and made me giggle frequently.) The cast of characters and their interplay alternately amused and touched me. The backgrounds and motivations sprinkled through the narrative put flesh on the bones of people you could care about. The sudden u-turns would leave me thinking...""no, wait! Oh noooo...."". But it kept me reading. It kept me caring about this unlikely group of young people setting out to change their lives; pushing and pulling against each other and the past and the longings for a different future. A story of mistakes, hopes, regrets, forgiveness, understanding, growth, change, and loyalty, all tied up in the madcap adventure of four unique young'ins to everywhere and nowhere. Much of the story was a 5 star read; a point deducted because a few of the side roads left me scratching my head as to why they were included. Must have been asleep when I passed that scenery somehow. Still, I sped through an almost six hundred page book in record time and enjoyed it immensely. "
664,4.0,"I am between a 4 and a 5 on this, and the star rating may change. What won't change is my heartfelt opinion that this is a truly delightful (though not always happy) affecting romp. People will, I am sure, compare this to all sorts of American road trip books, and I suppose rightly so. The source material for this though is as firmly routed in Greek mythology as in the American myth. This is not a guess, Towles is not subtle about his influences. Achilles and Patroclus are here in the form of Duchess and Wooly (with a little less implied homosexuality), two of the most entertaining escaped prisoners since since Raising Arizona. We have Odysseus (here actually named Ulysses) and Penelope (but a better Penelope who doesn't sit around and wait.) Their part in the story is not central, but rather one of the delightful detours Towles takes us on. Sometimes with long books (this is nearly 600 pages) I get frustrated with detours, but not here. These detours are fun and edifying, and help to create a sense of time and place, and to reinforce the moral(s) of the story. Maybe even more importantly, these side characters all suggest their own larger stories, and my mind went there, thinking about their lives before we met them, and wondering about where they next went. I often like stories where the ""main"" characters are the least interesting characters (think Seinfeld) and that is very much the case here. Emmett is honorable, star-crossed, decent, but nonetheless bland, if in an occasionally heroic way. Bland though he is, Emmett works as an offset for Duchess. No blandness there, Duchess is a huge scenery chewing personality, and he is to my mind the star of this show and he doesn't leave much room for another big character.My one significant problem with the book was Billy, Emmett's eight year-old brother. He is the one character who influences the behavior of every other character. He had a Christ-like thing going on (at least for most of the book) that irritated me. His innocence and impossible intelligence touches all who encounter him other than one truly evil character who flits in briefly. The way Billy was drawn grated on me. I am not entirely sure why. I like plenty of books with the ""and a child shall lead them"" narrative -- A Prayer for Owen Meany and A Children's Bible spring to mind -- but Billy's aw shucks wisdom didn't work for me. Maybe it was this eight year old midwestern kid's PhD level understanding of myth and honor. My dislike of the character and its function as the armature on which the central message is based was real but I cannot for the life of me say why it did not work for me. His unreality should not have bothered me. Its not like the characters are supposed to be realistic. I suspect my problem is my antipathy for entertainment featuring wise precocious children who know more than the adults around them. Don't blame me, blame the little brother in Sixteen Candles. He broke me. I also think I have an issue with giving this the 5-star because I loved A Gentleman in Moscow so much. This was good, but not as good as that. Towles is sort of a victim of his own success here. Anyway, read the book. It's fun."
665,5.0,"Amor, thanks for another great read!  The story is set in 1954. Because I was born in 1951, a lot of the background and thinking of the time was very nostalgic to me. There are 4 main characters, 3 boys about 18 years old and one younger boy who is 8 years old. Each chapter is told in the first person format. It's especially fun to hear the same events spelled out from the different perspectives. The personality of each of the boys is extremely well drawn. You'll get to know and love each of them with all of their faults and weaknesses. There are many hilarious moments, insightful moments, and plenty of very sad moments. There were many other great and interesting characters, an old professor who has written a book that has been read 26 times by the 8 year old. The book is the story of mythological characters and other heroes, and it parallels some of boys' lives and gives us some great things to think about in our own lives. Another character, Ulysses, is very affected by Billie, the 8 year old as Billy compares his life to the story of the mythological Ulysses which gives him hope that he may be reunited with his family.Another is an 18 year old girl who is very savvy, sassy, talented, nurturing and full of life. All and all, great story telling, very realistic and enjoying, sometimes the story is almost like a fable or fairytale with a little magic thrown in here and there. One last thought for Amor Towles: this one deserves a sequel. I'm still wondering about the future of many of the characters. If this will help, I'll pay double the normal price for the sequel. "
666,5.0,"I was irritated it took me 17 days to finish this book, now I’m glad, for without it, the last 17 days would have been much worse.Thank you Towles."
667,3.0,"I know there were a lot of people who loved this, but after such anticipation, I was disappointed. To me it lacked the magic of Towles's earlier two books, in particular, A Gentleman In Moscow, but then that book set such a high bar. Here, instead of having his central character virtually under house arrest and retaining the narrative to a single setting in ""Moscow,"" Towles hits the open road in 1954 with four characters that made me think of Of Mice & Men by way of Huck Finn. I did like some of the atmospheric choices, such as the Highline decades before it became known as such and was still part of the railway spur that serviced the meatpacking district. But there were too many instances of deus ex machina, too many inconceivable occurrences, I could not suspend belief. I did finish since I was intrigued enough to learn what happens to these people, but was ultimately unsatisfied. "
668,1.0,"I'm furious that I will never get the 15 hours I listened to this book back.. what a disappointment. The 1 star reflects not only the utter boredom I felt toward everything in this novel (the plot, the characters, the writing) but also how my excitement to finally read Towles was quashed by this pedestrian novel."
669,5.0," As seen on   www.mysteryandsuspense.com Amor Towles, author of “A Gentleman in Moscow” and “Rules of Civility”, returns with an emotional and immersive historical fiction novel, “The Lincoln Highway”.  In 1954, Emmett Watson returns home from a prison work camp, after serving time for assault. When he returns home to his deceased father’s farm, he finds the property out of shape and creditors at the door. Desperate to make a new life for himself and his little brother, Billy, Emmett decides to leave Nebraska behind. Billy is determined to go to California, after finding postcards from their estranged mother than indicate she has settled there, and he convinces Emmett to drive there by way of The Lincoln Highway, the first cross-country highway in America. But of course, things don’t go as expected and both Emmett and Billy end up having an entirely different adventure than the one they initially planned, with train-jumping transients, a life-changing book, and two waylaid criminals along the way!“The Lincoln Highway” is captivating and utterly compelling, telling the story of two brothers, abandoned by their parents, who are determined to start a new life together. Young Billy is an utter gem, with his love for books (one book in particular) and his genuine trust in humanity making him an immediate fan favourite. The characters on Towles’ “Highway” are so desperately flawed, with genuine intentions, that there isn’t a bad one in the bunch. The fact that three of the characters are ex-convicts doesn’t even make a dent in their personalities, as I loved them because of their backgrounds, and in spite of them. The chapters are labeled backwards, from ten to one, because, as Billy says, “all good stories start in the middle”. The story is told chronologically though, so the story flows easily. Emmett is the primary narrator for the story, although we do hear from Duchess, Woolly and a few other travelers who the brothers meet along their journey. Woolly’s heartbreaking story (and tragic ending) has enough emotional horsepower for its own novel, but his innocent and trusting relationships with the other characters add to his charm. Even with a heartbreaking ending, the humanity within Towles’ pages will leave an indelible mark. Towles’ novel is a non-stop page turner from the beginning, and it is compulsively readable. Unique and creative with sympathetic, human characters, “Highway” is one of those novels that will stay with you long after the last page. "

672,5.0,"Wow-what an incredible story. A story like nothing we have seen in fiction for a very long time. At 570 pages you will want to dedicate a full weekend to reading this multi-character novel. I would strongly suggest reading in large chunks rather than short bursts-easier to keep track of the characters and switch points of view. What makes this story so unique-It is the story of an adventure. The characters are multidimensional and well developed. Each character has a background story equally as interesting as the one previously. The reader is on the adventure with the four primary characters. My favorite character was Billy-I loved this brilliant character and Towles gave him some incredible lines. Not sure if this will be a book club favorite due to the length, however it will remain on the best seller list for an extended period of time and will be a hugely popular Christmas gift."
673,5.0,"So worth every star and more! This was a masterful story-Amor Towles has hit it out of the park-again! There have been quite a few fantastic reviews here on GR for this so I won't go to any length explaining my delight in reading it. Although close to 600 pages, it went by so quickly, quicker than I wanted it to. Will definitely be rereading it-just as I did Gentleman in Moscow. To be honest I haven't read Rules of Civility and am really scared of not liking it and being disillusioned after loving the last two books he wrote."
675,4.0," Finished this last night and am still unsettled by the last few chapters which is affecting how I feel about the entire reading experience. Makes me think I didn't understand the story at all. Up until then, this was 5 stars for me and I may come back to revise this review later.  Enjoyed the characters and the locations; the dream of California, the reality of New York City! My favorite parts were when the characters were in the city; driving through the Lincoln Tunnel, the incline where the guys riding the rails camped (now the High Line with shops and art?), the Empire State Building. Book is a fast read but I don't think I will forget this one quickly. "
676,5.0,"High adventure set in 1954 rural and big city America. The Lincoln Highway is a tribute to the likes of Tom Sawyer, The Odyssey and every other ‘heroes journey’ epic worth reading. At nearly 600 pages, I only wish it were another 200 pages, it’s that enjoyable. The characters are highly defined and archetype-credible. The story, set over 10 days, is tightly woven and made me reminisce about my own childhood and early adulthood. Easily a favorite book in the past several years."
677,4.0,"In brief - Hum - on the one hand this was rather slow, on the other it was a great tale!! In fullThis book is set in the early 1950s in the USA and starts with Emmett returning to the family farm in the care of a warden. He has been in a juvenile detention centre and while he has been in there his father has died. As a result of his father's death and some unfortunate seasons on the farm his first task is to sign over the property to the bank. He is then reunited with his younger brother (Billy) again who has been staying with neighbours until his return. For a number of reasons the brothers decide that a fresh start elsewhere would be good. Emmett has managed to keep his own car from repossession and so they plan to leave and travel the Lincoln Highway heading west as soon as possible.However...! They have a surprise in store as two other inmates of the juvenile facility hitched a ride without the warden knowing and have other ideas about their direction of travel. Quite a variety of characters wander the pages of this book and the narratives are from a number of perspectives including theirs. Of these two new arrivals the main player initially is Duchess who definitely seems to be the leader. The other person is Woolly - he seems to be ""other worldly"" and is but is very good at it!The story follows Emmett's and the others travels, generally in a linear fashion (allowing for the characters reminiscing). I see that reviews of this tend to vary from ""I loved it"" to ""it was too slow"". I actually understand both those positions. At times I felt as though I was reading a series short stories as each of the characters develop. The pace was at best fairly slow. However some of those stories were simply SO good that I was held by this. All the characters are credible and become very rounded over time. Even the more minor players do their job very well for me.So this is a ""road trip"" from different perspectives? Probably but it does it very well for me and is something beyond that maybe. This book contains quite a few powerful stories. If parts felt really quite slow that may say more about my patience than the book. I think if you relax and allow this book to engage you, you are in for a good read. The same applies if you like character driven narratives. If you want an action packed adventure this is probably not for your.Note - I received an advance digital copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for a fair reviewhttps://viewson.org.uk/fiction/the-li..."
678,3.0,"Decent storytelling but it's too long, too regular. The American road novel has been done so many times before and, for all Lincoln Highway's competency, Towles doesn't really add anything new to the mix."
679,5.0,"For anyone who loved A Gentleman in Moscow and William Kent Krueger’s This Tender Land, this is not to be missed. "
680,4.0,"It's June 12, 1954. Eighteen-year-old Emmett Watson returns to his family farm in Nebraska after serving time in a juvenile detention work camp. His father has passed away and the farm is being foreclosed by the bank. His eight-year-old brother Billy is anxious to head west to California in search of their mother who abandoned them years ago. All that they have are a series of postcards she sent from various stops along the Lincoln Highway as she traveled to San Francisco. But as soon as they set out for their new adventure, Emmett discovers that while he was driven home by the Warden, teenagers Duchess and Wooly hid in the trunk escaping the facility. And they have very different plans for the four of them. So instead of heading west, their destination is now Wooly’s family home located in New York’s Adirondacks where an inheritance awaits him. He offers to split $150,000, which is hidden in a safe. And Duchess has some scores to settle along the way. And so the mayhem begins - including a road trip in a Studebaker, a journey as stowaways on freight railcars and more. And a glimpse of 1950s New York City in all its wonder and excitement. A wide range of characters the brothers meet along the way enhance this creative story, which is filled with both humor and pathos. Amor Towles weaves quite a story, which takes place over a ten-day period. His books are so unlike anyone else’s. You’ll adore young Billy and want to savor Towle’s wonderful prose.I wonder if while reading The Lincoln Highway, anyone else kept hearing in their head Simon & Garfunkel singing “I've gone to look for America.”Rated 4.25 stars.Review posted on MicheleReader.com."
681,4.0,"This book starts with 18 year old Emmet returning to his family farm following the death of his father. He is being driven home by the warden of the work farm where he has been serving time for involuntary manslaughter. We are introduced to Emmet’s younger brother Billy, the neighbour and the neighbour’s daughter Sally.  The story seems to be unrolling gently in the direction of a road trip until we discover that two other inhabitants of the Salina work farm have stowed away unnoticed in the warden’s car with the intention of joining Emmet in some manner of ‘adventure’.This adds a frisson of anxiety to the story, we have no idea of these people’s intensions. Will Emmet’s visions of a new life be destroyed by the company he keeps? Will it, as my Grandmother used to say, ‘All end in tears’?But the story does not take the expected direction and while these new companions complicate Emmet’s plans, melodrama is pushed to the side and we are reassured by the author’s calm, careful prose, as our heroes sensibly skirt several possible disasters and continue their journey.Then about two thirds of the way through the narrative seems to lose its way, lack a natural conclusion. When you realise what is happening it is a shock, the ending discordant and jarring.The story is told from several different points of view, each with their own distinct voice, and along the way we encounter may interesting and appealing characters, people who for the most part display intelligence and generosity of spirit. Sally’s character was a particular standout, although I did feel she could have been further developed.The author seems to be trying to create a fable about flawed heroes, to connect the characters’ journey with the heroes in Billy’s book but it never quite works. This is definitely a book worth reading, the author’s prose is always a pleasure.It is just not the literary delight I have come to expect from Amor Towles.I received this book from Net Galley, in exchange for an honest review."
682,3.0,"2.5Thank you to Penguin Random House for providing me an advance copy to review!As someone who adored Gentleman in Moscow, and was less sure about Rules of Civility, I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into this. What I was hoping would be a road-trip book ended up meandering quite a bit, and unfortunately I spent a lot of the 600-odd pages being unsure of what the point of it was. After finishing the book, I think that the wandering/side-tracking/serendipity  was  the point, and maybe this just wasn't meant for me. Some of the side characters were pretty interesting, and I liked the collision course Emmett and Duchess were on, but otherwise I felt the use of seemingly endless perspectives and the third-person narration created a distance between myself and the characters and I couldn't connect to any of them as much as I'd hoped. This is definitely a book about America, masculinity, and boys becoming their fathers (and resistance to this) - all interesting concepts - but I think I just needed a bit more plot to keep me invested."

684,5.0," “The Lincoln Highway” is a totally different book from Towles previous two books but is no less a 5-star read. It is the story of 18-year old Emmett and his 8-year old brother Billy and Emmett’s 1948 baby blue Studebaker.Emmet returns home to Nebraska from reform school to find that the bank has foreclosed on his deceased father’s farm. Emmett had no intention of becoming a farmer anyway. So, time for a fresh start in a new place. Emmett and Billy agree to take the Lincoln Highway to San Francisco where they think they will find their long lost mother.Before they get started two guys from Emmett’s reform school show up having escaped. This puts a crimp in Emmett and Billy’s plans as these guys want to go to New York and each has a perfectly good reason for going. Or so it appears. On the surface.Emmett decides that a short detour won’t be much of a problem, (how wrong can he be?) and, hey, the Lincoln Highway actually starts in New York City anyway, so off they go. The book bobs and weaves between these characters as well as secondary characters they meet along the way, each an interesting story of its own.The Lincoln Highway is more of a metaphor because as things turn out they don’t actually get to drive the Lincoln Highway from New York to San Francisco (at least not within the pages of this book).Nevertheless, it is a journey for all involved that will not soon be forgotten (as it was for this reader).The book has multiple themes sharing life lessons if one cares to look.I hate books with no quotation marks for dialogue but in this book it seemed to work just fine probably a testament to the excellent writing skill of the author."
685,5.0,"Emmett Watson is driven home by the warden of the juvenile detention facility from which Emmett was just released. His father has recently died, his mother is gone, and the family farm has been foreclosed upon. Emmett plans to take his brother, Billy, and start a new life in a city far away, but the sudden arrival of two friends from the facility, Duchess and Woolly, pull Emmett into another direction.One of the memorable things about this novel is that every character, from young Billy to deeply flawed Duchess and, oddly, even the villains of the book like the wicked preacher, has something to offer the world and, more specifically, to the developing character of eighteen-year-old Emmett.The truth of the novel is that each character is deeply flawed and, out of these flaws and the consequences of those flaws, each character becomes a better human being.A wise book that I heartily recommend."
687,3.0,"There were parts of this I loved but it didn't live up to Towles' other two novels for me. It felt like a young adult book. That isn't necessarily a problem if you're expecting that, because I've absolutely loved some young adult books as an adult. I couldn't help thinking of Holes with this and it was so much better. The Lincoln Highway at it's core is about two brothers. Emmett the elder, is just getting out of work camp to care for his younger brother Billy after their father dies. Their mother had deserted the family and their sleepy Nebraska town many years prior for a more exciting life. Emmett's plan is to travel to a place with a growing population, and rehab houses while they live in them. Billy wants to take the same trip their mother took when she deserted the family in hopes of finding her in San Francisco. This journey sets the brothers on a fantastical journey that was entertaining for awhile. I loved what I thought would be the coming of age of the orphan brothers as they take their trip down the Lincoln Highway. I was sure it would contain some poignant moments of growth like, A Gentleman in Moscow. Unfortunately I had much higher expectations for how it would turn out.One of the biggest problems I had with The Lincoln Highway were the multiple perspectives. It worked for the 1st half, maybe even 2/3 for me. I always liked Billy's and Emmett's perspectives, but Duchess' and Woolly's perspectives began to increasingly grate on me after Ulysses was introduced. I kept hoping the story would be more about Ulysses, Emmett, Billy the professor, and less about Duchess and Woolly. The next biggest problem I had was the ending. It didn't include the type of the life lessons I had expected and ended up to be purely materialistic. I can understand how some loved this, but it didn't all come together for me. I'll still read Towles' next book because of the brilliance in his other two and also because I'm kind of in love with him from his writing, to his profile and picture on his Goodreads page! ; )"

690,5.0,"Thank you to Penguin Group Viking and NetGalley for providing an advance copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. The book will be published on October 5th, 2021.Writing: 5/5 Characters: 5/5 Plot: 4/5On the one hand, a wild adventure story. It is 1954 and 18-year old Emmet Watson is driven back to Nebraska by the warden of the juvenile detention facility where he has served 15 months for involuntary manslaughter. His mother left years ago, and his father just died; the bank is preparing to foreclose on the farm and all their belongings. He is now the guardian of his 8-year old brother, Billy. While they plan to drive to California to start a new life, two stowaways (Duchess and Woolly) from the facility have a different idea. And so it goes…The writing is — of course — excellent. The narration alternates between Emmett, Duchess, and Woolly, with occasional chapters from a few others. Each character has a distinctive voice as they describe both events and their inner thought processes during the ten days covered. Billy is my favorite character — never a narrator he somehow becomes a focal point for all of the stories. He is earnest, innocent, smart as a whip, and somewhat beatific. Billy doesn’t go anywhere without his large red book — Professor Abacus Abernathe’s Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers and Other Intrepid Travelers. This book — which mixes mythical with real-life heroes (all male by the way) in its A to Z collection — serves as a kind of Greek chorus for the action as Billy pores over the pages offering its inspiration to those he meets.There are many layers to this book, and I don’t claim to understand them all. Well articulated moral themes as interpreted and internalized by our different players. I loved Sister Agnes’ Chains of Wrongdoing lecture (which I include in the quotes below). This book will keep book club discussions going forever. Interesting note: I loved Rules of Civility and yet tried twice to read A Gentleman of Moscow and could not get past about page 50. This book was impossible to put down. One more interesting note: I did find this book a little stressful which says more about me than about the book. It reminded me of the nightmares I sometimes have where I need to get to the airport but things keep happening and then while trying to address those things, other things keep happening, etc. There is an element of that in the pages that stressed me while I tried (in my head) to get our protagonists back on track. My advice for reading — just let it go and enjoy the ride.A few good quotes:“Rather, the comfort of knowing one’s sense of right and wrong was shared by another, and thus was somehow more true.”“Some evidence of that one desire so delectable, so insatiable that it overshadowed all others, eclipsing even the desires for a home, a family, or a sense of human dignity.”“From a man’s point of view, the one thing that’s needful is that you sit at his feet and listen to what he has to say, no matter how long it takes for him to say it, or how often he’s said it before.”“One of her favorite lessons was something she referred to as the Chains of Wrongdoing. Boys, she would begin in her motherly way, in your time you shall do wrong unto others and others shall do wrong unto you. And these opposing wrongs will become your chains. The wrongs you have done unto others will be bound to you in the form of guilt, and the wrongs that other have done unto you in the form of indignation. The teachings of Jesus Christ Our Savior are there to free you from both. To free you from your guilt through atonement and from your indignation through forgiveness. Only once you have freed yourself from both of these chains may you begin to live your life with love in your heart and serenity in your step.”“Let’s simply say that my academy was the thoroughfare, my primer experience, and my instructor the fickle finger of fate.”"

While it turned out to be vastly different from what I was expecting (for example, the very limited time actually spent on the Lincoln Highway), it was an absolute delight to read and came together so strongly in the end.The year is 1954. Emmett, having just been released from a juvenile work farm, arrives home to Nebraska where he is reunited with his younger brother Billy. The two set their sights on California, where they hope to rebuild their lives and perhaps even find their mother who left long ago. However, any plans they had made are derailed when they discover that two guys from the work farm, Duchess and Woolly, secretly hitched a ride to Nebraska in the trunk of the car that delivered Emmett home, and it turns out they have some ideas of their own.Right off the bat, I liked Emmett and Billy as characters, especially Billy with his sweetness and innocence. Duchess was immensely frustrating with his recklessness and impulsive nature; there were some moments when I sympathized with him after learning about his past, but he remained driven by selfish intentions until the very end. Aside from Duchess, most of the rest of the characters were enjoyable to read.The writing style was crisp, witty, and consistent, each word clearly having been chosen thoughtfully (including “absotively”!). I thought it was interesting that the author chose to write certain points of view in first person, and others in third person - certainly a testament to his intentionality. Additionally, the way that the author wove in the anecdotes from each character’s lives at just the right moments really emphasized key ideas. Those connections, between past and present experiences, were some of my favorite parts of the book. For example, the character of Ulysses, a wanderer who had abandoned his wife and child with little hope of seeing them again. Billy explained that he could be named after the hero Ulysses (as opposed to the president) and that although it has been 8 years, he may still be reunited with his family after 10 years, just as the hero was. That, and their meeting with Professor Abernathe, felt so profound.While parts of the book seemed to meander, and I wondered what I was supposed to be taking away, the ending truly brought everything together in a climactic and satisfying manner. This is what really turned this book into a 5-star read for me. For example, Billy’s interactions with Pastor John, which I had frankly forgotten by the end of the book, helped him to recognize the selfishness and manipulation from Duchess and therefore to take action at a crucial moment. The knowledge from Billy’s compendium of heroes afforded some interesting full-circle moments, such as when Billy secretly traveled in the trunk of the Studebaker to Woolly’s family home or when he starts his personal hero story at Emmett’s trip back to Nebraska from the work farm, exactly where the book itself begins. The originality and creativity of Towles’ newest novel make for a delightfully charming read. The Lincoln Highway is packed with drama, with tender-hearted and flawed characters, and with sophisticated storytelling. Ambitious in size and scope, this book will keep readers engaged from its unexpected beginning until its satisfying conclusion. "
692,2.0,"While I loved A Gentleman in Moscow, I just could not get into this book no matter how hard I tried. "
694,5.0,"What a fantastic book! Absorbing and thought-provoking, the wildest and highly entertaining American road trip joyride that changes lives. Full of wisdom, life, and humor, at close to 600 pages, it is a long one, but well worth the time.  I adored Sally and Billy and loved the elaborate meal set up.  THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY by acclaimed author, Amor Towles is a classic must-read. Highly recommend the audiobook narrated by: Edoardo Ballerini, Marin Ireland, and Dion Graham (Narrator). I also purchased the hardcover which is a classic for any home library. Set in 1954, the book begins with 18-year-old Emmett Watson. He is released from a juvenile work farm in Kansas and driven home by a warden to the town in Nebraska, after his father's death. Emmett is a hard worker and knows carpentry and wants nothing more than to head to Texas so he can get back into real estate and flip houses. Their family farm is now under foreclosure due to their dad's issues with money. So this is time to start over. They have nothing but his vintage Studebaker. After going to the library and checking the Encyclopaedia Britannica he thinks Texas would be a good place to start over with his younger brother. He has a younger eight-year-old little brother, Billy. Readers will fall in love with him. Very smart. Billy wants them to make a road trip and move to California. Their mother left them years ago and for a time she sent postcards along the Lincoln Highway. Billy thinks she will be waiting for them. That was eight years ago. Also, Billy has it in his mind they need to reach California by July 4th since that was a favorite holiday of his mom's.However, they are about to leave on their road trip, and fate steps in. There are many challenges and their trip is derailed when two guys show up at the farm. The two (Wooly and Duchess were hiding in the trunk of the car). They have a different plan. So now they have two extra guys on their road trip. Emmett's plan is to drop them at the bus station and then he and his brother will continue their trip, but fate has something different in mind. Along the way, there is a complex game of cat and mouse. Duchess is an interesting character that Billy likes. However, they must watch for him. He also believes in life there are checks and balances. Duchess has a plan to go to NY and grab the $150k from the safe in Wooly's family home (family trust). However, that will involve stealing Emmett's car, leaving Billy and Emmett on their own to catch a ride on a freight train, since they have no money. There they run into more problems with a pastor trying to steal Billy's coin collection, and then on the train, they meet Ulysses, a Black veteran who comes to their rescue, who has been riding the rails since his own family disappeared during WWII plus more characters. The author keeps readers hanging on every word. Set over a ten-day period of time we hear from each character. Each character is chasing their own dreams and their past and present connect sons, fathers, brothers, and strangers. We see evil as well as kindness. Hope and failure. Often the sidekicks can be as important as family. It is all about the journey. Themes: race, class, gender, and mental illness - handed down throughout generations. The novel also has a Gatsby-like vibe. A tour de force, well constructed, and beautifully written soulful story. Anyone who loves reflection, nostalgia, lyrical prose, excellent storytelling, coming-of-age, and literary fiction, will enjoy this compulsively readable novel.

695,5.0,"I loved this book so much! No, it is not anything like ""A Gentleman in Moscow,"" but it doesn't need to be. It is a wonderful book in itself. It is the story of 18-year-old Emmett (1954, Nebraska) being released from a correctional camp for underage offenders. He has decided to start a new life in Texas or California with his 8-year-old brother, Billy. Since their mom and dad are both gone, and they have lost their farm, there is no reason to stay. However, when the warden escorts Emmett home, unbeknownst to him, there are two stow-aways who are escaping from the camp in the trunk of his car. And these two boys have other ideas for Emmett and Billy. They want to go to New York -- And the adventure begins!When I first learned what this book was about, I didn't think I was going to like the two sets of characters having two such disparate goals. But, in the end, that is what makes the book. And what is even better, is that the reader falls in love with each of the characters. They are all so likeable, even loveable. And, so instead of trying to figure out what was going to happen and how I thought everything should go, I just decided to sit back and enjoy the ride! And what a ride it is!The Lincoln Highway is a book that will captivate you and steal your heart. It is fast-paced and its many pieces fit together intricately. The characters take turns telling the story by chapter, so you hear each of their voices and get to know them more intimately. It is just a lovely book that I never thought could live up to ""Gentleman."" But it just doesn't need to. It's a wonderful book all by itself. No comparison needed. Read it -- I think you're going to like it! ;)"
696,5.0,"Road Trip! Towles clearly was inspired by the ancient Greek story of Ulysses and how the hero was continually side-tracked in his 10-year effort to return home to Ithaca. The Ulysses-type hero in this story is 18-year-old Emmett Watson, who has been recently released from a juvenile work farm in Kansas and driven home by a kind warden to a small town in Nebraska. He is determined to pick up his precocious 8-year-old brother Billy and head somewhere new so that he can use his carpentry skills to start fresh. Billy wants to go to San Francisco via the Lincoln Highway in hopes of meeting up with their mother who abandoned them years before. California sounds perfect to Emmett.Unfortunately, Emmett and Billy are continually side-tracked from going West. First of all, two of Emmett’s bunkmates stowaway in the trunk of the warden’s car in order to join Emmett and Billy. Duchess and Wooly are trouble! Duchess is the son of a vaudevillian Shakespearean actor. His convoluted morals cause him to justify stealing Emmett’s car and abandoning Emmett and Billy. As for wealthy Wooly, he is a sweet, naïve young man addicted to some sort of opioid. Duchess is determined to get his hands on Wooly’s trust-fund cash lying in a safe in the Adirondacks.Towles packs this road trip with memorable adventures and engaging characters. Emmett moves forward with Midwestern integrity and determination to get he and his brother on the road West. Fortunately, it takes just 10 eventful days versus 10 years. Enjoy the trip!"
697,5.0,"If I had written a masterpiece like “A Gentleman in Moscow”, I would never have had the guts to put pen to paper again. I’m SO glad Amor Towles not only had the guts, but trusted his immense talent, to write “The Lincoln Highway”! Who says lightning can’t strike twice?!The story takes place in the space of ten days in 1954 and it is a “road trip” bildungsroman with four unforgettable young men, and the iconic yet fresh characters they meet along the way. They travel by car and by riding the rails, and yet it is still something of an adventurous “voyage”.The four (three late-teen men, and a boy): perceptive and kind Emmet, a young man who has served his time for manslaughter, his younger brother, eight-year-old Billy, and two unrelated young men, the complicated but bighearted Duchess (Daniel), and sweet but damaged Woolly. Duchess and Woolly met Emmet at the juvenile reform farm in Kansas where he was serving his sentence, but they “released themselves on their own recognizance” (to quote the Coen Brothers’, “Raising Arizona”).And then there is semisweet, practical, reliable, stalwart, and stubborn Sally.With everything they own on their backs, the four set out, each with his own goal and dream in mind. Billy’s goal is the most archetypal; he is in search of their mother.Towles perfectly renders a Epic Hero’s Journey that skillful blends the mythic and the realistic. Billy is fascinated with the adventures of the Greek gods and demigods, while Emmett strives to keep the practicalities of their journey - in search of a new and stable life - in the forefront. If “The Lincoln Highway” is Towles’ “Iliad” – then I can’t wait to read his “Odyssey”, because I’m not ready to be done with this journey, and I don’t think Towles is, either. "
698,3.0,"I did not enjoy reading this book as I did this author's previous works. It was not my cup of tea. The book is creative in its plot, but the various crises presented along the way annoyed me rather than fascinated me. I could imagine reading this with children as morality discussion opportunities or possibly ""what if"" thinking challenges, asking them what they might do under same circumstances.Since the author does have a couple of children perhaps this was his motivation? As an old grumpy woman, I can safely project I won't be having any of the challenges these young 'uns from Nebraska have to face in the aftermath of the death of their father."
699,2.0,"This highway needs repairs...Get ready for a bumpy read! Ugh I wanted to like this one so much but Towles just flooded this book with an obscene amount of classic stories that will have you asking are we there yet? Did anyone else think this could’ve been written as a YA novel?The book starts off in 1954 with Emmett, who has just been released from prison in Nebraska. He goes home to find that his father has passed away so it’s just him and his younger brother Billy. Billy is a wide-eyed, naive character that would say “oh geez mister” in an old film while wearing a newsboy cap. You are either going to love him or want to punch him in the face. The schtick got old for me. They are about to take the Lincoln Highway to find their mother in California when Duchess and Woolly show up and crash their party. They’ve just escaped prison and they convince Billy and Emmet to change their plans to go after Woolly’s family’s money.This is NOT a road trip adventure, most of the book takes place in NYC with Duchess tracking down his dad, Emmett tracking down Duchess and Billy telling strangers classic tales.There is so much rambling you will feel like you’re on the most boring road trip of your life. The whole setup of the book was never actualized and you never quite know where you are headed. I get that you want an adventure to take twists and turns but the detours in this one left me looking for the exit."
700,3.0,"Oh so disappointed. A wonderful start, but it lost it's magic for me pretty early. I found myself skimming chapters, something I rarely do. I think it's tough for an author to follow on the heels of a wildly popular book like Gentleman in Moscow, but this book almost felt like a YA novel. The author's heart didn't seem to be in it. Still, Towles has writing skills so if a boy's road trip across the country sounds good, this could be enjoyable."
701,3.0,"Questions can be so tricky, he said, like forks in the road. You can be having such a nice conversation and someone will raise a question, and the next thing you know you’re headed off in a whole new direction. In all probability, this new road will lead you to places that are perfectly nice, but sometimes you just want to go in the direction you were already headed.A road trip that backfires and stutters, barely getting started. Not a trip taking in the states from east to west coasts as I’d hoped and expected but, once I realised I was to enjoy the characters rather than the scenery, I relaxed into it and enjoyed them indeed. The story is told from from all the characters’ viewpoints in turn (though only Duchess’ and Sally’s chapters are in the first person) and, as well as seeing the same scene from different points of view, we also switch characters as the action rollicks along. The outstanding achievement here is that they come across as individuals, with strong, unique voices. I was engaged with each of them throughout their ‘escapade’.My main niggle is that it went on for so many pages and I was on the verge of losing interest towards the end. A second niggle is the actual ending - a big surprise to me and I’m still not sure I’m entirely happy with it.With thanks to Random House Cornerstone via NetGalley for the opportunity to read an ARC."
702,5.0,"My name is Sarah and I'm an Amor Towles-aholicNow please excuse me a while I wax lyrical about this humdinger of a story.THIS BOOK!!!!!OMG!!!@amortowles has a way of writing characters that are so delicious it's like they burst from the page, fling an arm around your shoulders and give you a big kiss on the cheek!I needed Billy Watson in my life so badly, he is such a beautiful character. He has been cared for by his neighbour while his brother Emmett was at a juvenile work farm for 18 months. Now returned to their foreclosed farm in Nabraska, Emmett has come to collect Billy and his Studebaker and head for California....or Texas....USA ROADTRIP!Prepare yourself to go on an adventure on a road with so many bends and turns with a stunning cast of broken, damaged, adorable, heroic, unique and colourful characters who all get a chance to have their own say in this novel being told from numerous points of view.The writing is beyond exquisit, the story is engaging and the settings are numerous and fascinating, (especially to me who is desperate to tour the USA)Waxing lyrical completeI'm missing this story already and may have to read it again"
703,4.0,"Страхотен Тауълс! Топла, уютна книга, изпълнена с приключения, дилеми и чудесни герои. Ох ❤"
704,5.0,"Not a typical road trip, the Lincoln Highway in this book has rather a metaphorical meaning (for me). Though you can't say, the characters here suffered from lack of adventures, only a different kind of. Amor Towles has an outstanding talent for drawing you in and keeping you emotionally connected from the very beginning to the very last page. I can imagine that the ending could take you by surprise (view spoiler)[, and even make you angry, in some way. It did to me, I was.  (hide spoiler)]. But it also will leave you with a desperate craving for spending more time with these such memorable characters. And it is what counts. The book that will stay with me for a very long time.  "
705,5.0,"I loved this book— read it nice and slow and savored it, which is just the thing to do with Towles. I loved the literary references and the side characters and the writing was gorgeous. "
706,4.0,"If you liked “Rules of Civility” or “A Gentleman in Moscow”, you must get “The Lincoln Highway” immediately! It’s brilliant, evocative, entertaining, and unforgettable, and written in Towles’s eloquent and inimitable style. If for some reason you weren’t wowed by Towles’s first two books, I highly encourage you to give “The Lincoln Highway” a chance. It will surely be one of my best books of 2021."
707,5.0,"Magnificent from start to finish. Reminiscent of yarns spun by Steinbeck or Twain, this is bound to become a literary classic. I already want to read it again."
708,3.0,"Amor Towles can definitely write. I absolutely adored A Gentleman in Moscow - the unusual premise and setting, the interesting characters and the thought-provoking conversations - and because of this my expectations may have been too high when it came to The Lincoln Highway. The one aspect that I enjoyed was 8-year old Billy and his Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers and other Intrepid Travelers. I don't normally have to love the characters to like the book, but I found Emmet, Duchess and even Woolly's selfishness very off-putting and it definitely impacted on my enjoyment of the story. I am most definitely an outlier with my 3-star rating, so please feel free to ignore my opinion.The Story: Four boys, three 18-year-olds who met in a juvenile reformatory, plus a brainy 8-year-old, as they set out from Nebraska in June, 1954, in an old Studebaker in pursuit of a better future."
709,4.0,"(3.5) In Towles' third novel — a big, old-fashioned dose of Americana — brothers and pals set out from Nebraska on road and rail adventures to find a fortune in 1950s New York. The book features some fantastic characters. Precocious Billy steals every scene he appears in. Duchess is a delightfully flamboyant bounder, peppering his speech with malapropisms and Shakespeare quotes. However, Emmett is a dull protagonist, and it's disappointing that Sally, one of just two main female characters, plays such a minor role. A danger with an episodic narrative is that random events and encounters pile up but don't do much to further the plot. At nearly 200 pages in, I realized little of consequence had happened yet. A long road, then, with some ups and downs along the way, but Towles' fans will certainly want to sign up for the ride.See my full review at BookBrowse.

710,5.0,"If I could- I would give this 10*. It’s one of the very best book I’ve read this year. Following 3 young men and a very astute boy from the Midwest to NY In the early 50’s. Every character is entertaining, as are the adventures along the way.I’m looking forward to a second read someday.GREAT STORY- so well written."
711,5.0,"I loved this book. Another masterfully told story from Mr. Towles, so expertly crafted and impactful. Populated with such memorable characters, a sense of nostalgia, some sadness, and most importantly, empathy. Wholly original and worlds different from his previous work. My time spent with Emmett, Billy, Sally, Duchess, Woolly & Ulysses won't soon be forgotten. And if anyone thought there would be a drop-off after ""A Gentleman in Moscow,"" think again. Fans will love this novel, and Mr. Towles is sure to win a legion of new followers, deservedly so, as he's written one of the best books of the year."
712,5.0,"This is magical. And it doesn’t even have any actual magic in it! But it’s just a beautiful, beautiful tale with characters you care a lot about. "
713,5.0,"Five blazing stars. Amor Towles is a MASTERFUL story-teller and a splendid spinner of yarn which enthralls. I was wowed by this author with his prior book, A Gentleman in Moscow, and he did it again with this his latest novel, The Lincoln Highway. I highly recommend this book and should warn that you may, like I did, stay up into the night telling yourself - just one more chapter and then another and another. Excellent prose; and watch out for the last sentence at the end of every chapter; that's the hook which gets you going. I would gladly sit in a class on creative writing delivered by Amor Towles :-)Besides, all the characters of this novel are very likeable. You root for them with your very soul. They are:Emmett who we meet as he is let out of a Juvenile Delinquency Camp in Salina. His father had just died and he is being driven home by a kind warden. Emmett is determined to take care of his younger brother, Billy. Emmett is not judgemental about his father's failures nor of his mother leaving them all. He is simply a decent boy turned decent man.Billy's innocence is the charm. Bright as a button, he has a strong sense of what's right and wrong; full of questions and a sense of curiosity as smart kids tend to be, this character adds the right amount of drama to this novel.Sally is the daughter of the farmer next door to Emmett's family's property in Morgen, Nebraska. Sally's mother passed away and this girl is left to do the cleaning and the cooking and the general taking care of her daddy, a farmer set in his ways. While Emmett is serving his term in Salina, it is Sally who takes care of little Billy. A reliable sweet girl. I was rooting for a happy ending for her. At this juncture, all I'll add is that when Sally is not busy baking pies and keeping an impeccable home, she is running errands in an old beat-up pickup truck she calls, Betty. Sally is a road warrior.Woolly and Duchess are two characters who are also at the Juvenile Camp in Salina. They are roommates of Emmett. Woolly is the youngest child from a filthy rich family; both his parents have passed on. Duchess, on the other hand, lost his mother to an illness and is raised by a father unfit for fatherhood or decency. Duchess' sense of right and wrong developed from his stay at an orphanage administered by nuns and from the hard scrabble existence of survival and life's experiences.The peripheral characters are just as interesting - Towhouse from Harlem; Ulysses, a war vet in search of his wife and child; a villainous Pastor John; mild tempered Sarah, Wooley's sister; Sister Agnes from the orphanage; and the wise Professor Abacus Abernathe whose compendium is read by Billy at least twenty five times.The crux of the story is about life after the detention centre and the stretch of highway which the boys hope will lead to a new life. To reveal anything further would be an injustice to someone planning to read this book. Reading this book was a thrilling, great mind-blowing ride along the Lincoln Highway. I will be remiss if I do not reproduce the words of wisdom (and they are VERY many) nestled in the wonderful prose of Amor Towles:Boys, she would begin in her motherly way, in your time you shall do wrong unto others and others shall do wrong unto you. And these opposing wrongs will become your chains. The wrongs you have done unto others will be bound to you in the form of guilt, and the wrongs that others have done unto you in the form of indignation. The teachings of Jesus Christ Our Savior are there to free you from both. To free you from your guilt through atonement and from your indignation through forgiveness. Only once you have freed yourself from both of these chains may you begin to live your life with love in your heart and serenity in your step.I am of the opinion, Professor, that everything of value in this life must be earned. That it should be earned. Because those who are given something of value without having to earn it are bound to squander it. One should earn respect. One should earn trust. One should earn the love of a woman, and the right to call oneself a man. And one should also earn the right to hope.But maybe, I was thinking as I was driving over the Hudson River, just maybe the will to stay put stems not from a man's virtues but from his vices. After all, aren't gluttony, sloth, and greed all about staying put. Don't they amount to sitting deep in a chair where you can eat more, idle more, and want more? In a way, pride and envy are about staying put too. For just as pride is founded on what you've built up around you, envy is founded on what your neighbour has built across the street. A man's home may be his castle, but the moat, it seems to me is just as good at keeping people in as it is at keeping people out. I do believe that the Good Lord has a mission for each and every one of us...There is a time in every man’s education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.I thought to myself that there are surely a lot of big things in America. The Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty are big. The Mississippi River and the Grand Canyon are big. The skies over the prairie are big. But there is nothing bigger than a man’s opinion of himself."
714,3.0,"I loved Towles’ previous novels and I’m always up for an epic hero quest, so I was really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, I was a little let down. Perhaps, my expectations were too high, but his latest doesn’t quite have the sparkling charm of his previous books. The characters are, no doubt, engaging, but it all felt contrived to me."
717,5.0,"This book and it’s characters are something that will stay with me for a very long time. All 576 pages of Amor Towles latest offering are perfection. You will meet Emmett, Billy, Sally, Sally’s dad, Woolly, Sarah Woolley’s sister, Duchess and Ulysses. These are just a few people who will I’m sure, capture your heart as it did mine. The story starts in Nebraska upon Emmett’s release from a work farm in Salinas Kansas. Here begins an unforgettable ride with unforgettable participants. Mr. Towles has the unique talent of crafting his characters so that you feel as if you know them personally. Some are virtuous, some are scoundrels, but you will close this book with stron emotions. Highly recommended. "
718,5.0,"Love this kind of book that you can settle into seamlessly. I listened while working on my tractor mowing, felt like stepped back in time instantly, holding my breath as chapters dropped away."
719,3.0,It started out 5 stars and then deteriorated. A lot of the road trip was great and I understand the detour but after that it fizzled. Sad as I loved the characters.
720,4.0,"5* for the writing and 3* for the story. This was a treat to read just for the writing alone. I am not really into adventure stories and did not care for the ending. After reading A Gentleman In Moscow and Rules for Civility, I will read any book Amor Towles writes in the future."
721,5.0,"Towles writes the kind of books that help you remember why you love reading. Effervescent, a little bit melancholy, and, ultimately, charming."
722,4.0,"Appeared here first: https://www.thenewdorkreviewofbooks.c...I guess it makes sense that one of our best pure storytellers would get around to writing a story where the major through-line is storytelling. That's what we have here in Amor Towles' third novel, The Lincoln Highway. On the surface, this is part coming-of-age story and part PG version of On The Road. But really, it's an homage to how stories are constructed, told, read, and enjoyed. Stories are part myth, part fact, part-real life, part pure imagination. At least that's how they are in their ideal state. And Towles very much wants us to read The Lincoln Highway thusly.It works. Of course it works. With a storyteller of Towles' caliber, it almost couldn't not work. But this is also a story that is sort of in love with its cleverness, its wholesomeness, and its penchant for winking at you, like your grandfather who has just slipped you a cookie before dinner. You may not think that's a bad thing. And I don't either, frankly. You'd have be a giant cynic to think those are bad qualities in a piece of literature. But as I am looking back on this novel, I can't quite put my finger on why I liked it, but didn't LIKE IT like it. I think maybe it's enjoying the wink so much that I'd almost have to close the covers and roll my eyes at it (behind its back of course, lest I hurt it's feeling!). Like it's almost too much. It is possible to have TOO many cookies before dinner.Maybe all this is beside the point. Because really, this is just a rippin' good yarn. It's 1954, and 18-year-old Emmett and his curious, bookish little brother Billy, plan to head out from their failed Nebraska farm to find their mother in San Francisco. Their father has just died, and Emmett has just been released from a stint in juvie after he punched a kid for insulting his family (the kid died when he fell and hit his head). But a couple of interlopers have stowed away in Emmett's ride back to his farm and now insinuated themselves into Emmett's plans. Woolly and Duchess have their own plan: Borrow Emmett's car, drive to upstate New York, and recover a $150,000 trust fund Woolly's rich family has left him. Emmett wants no part in this scheme. But when the two ""borrow"" his car, he and Billy have no choice but to head east to try to recover it. Adventure, a wide cast of characters, and a novel brimming with almost kitschy Americana ensues.So even though I felt like a little something was missing that would've moved this novel over the good-to-great hump, I still thoroughly enjoyed reading it. To read Amor Towles is to be as delighted reading as he seems to be writing. To me, this was more in the category of his first novel, Rules of Civility than his brilliant and massively successful second novel, A Gentleman In Moscow. But overall, I think readers generally and Towles fans specifically will be more than happy with this new novel."
723,4.0,"This boisterous & poignant coming-of-age story would be well-suited to a movie format. I think with the right actors on board, I'd be able to love the thoughtlessly unruly characters more. The sad thread that runs through this tale comes from the backstories of these boys--who were cast aside by their parents as the adults pursued personal happiness at the expense of their children. It did make me want to mother this group of wayward boys & imagine a happy future for Emmett & Billy. I read that A Gentleman in Moscow, which I found completely magical, will be a miniseries, directed by & starring Kenneth Branagh--which is awesome! Hopefully, this novel will make its way to the screen as well. "
724,2.0,"This was just okay for me, and honestly after all the hype (and all those pages) I was expecting more. This is my first Towles novel and looking at the reviews it seems as if I should have started with Gentlemen in Moscow. I see a lot of people comparing this work to previous works, but I don't have that burden and it still was largely a miss for me. The most likeable character in this book was an eight year old boy. The set up was great, but somewhere in the middle it just dragged with no end in sight, but the ending was unexpected and I appreciate that. There were too many povs for me and while some of the side characters were endearing I just wasn't entranced."
725,4.0,"The newest Towles novel is so much more than a trip across the Lincoln Highway. Love, friendships, gains, losses and tons of mayhem ensues in this wonderful novel and a cast of characters that are so well developed. I love you Billy, you are beyond your years, your mother would have been so proud of you. "
726,3.0,"Love hate relationship with this story. What I loved: -vivid characterizations; personalities come to life (for good or bad) we know them as people (not just people in the page). -humanness albeit mundane in parts, it’s something I love about literature…that people are people and I think it lends to my first point well. -philosophy rolled up in a tale.-Duchess (in the beginning only). What I hated:*hate might be too strong a word but I will go with it for illustration purposes. -the precious kid trope —(the saccharine gee-whiz) of Billy. You know, the uber-innocent genius kid, representing what is possible in us all? That trope. The whole redemption by proxy. Ugh. -stereotypes (we really don’t need to use them even when talking about a snapshot in history when we “think” they existed). Okay maybe they did exist back then. I don’t know, but we can have a Susie Homemaker have more depth than the baking sheet she used to make cookies, right?-Duchess in the middle to end. What a caricature he became. Sigh. -some plot points that beg credulity (Emmett’s decisions vis-a-vis Billy). Maybe it’s because he’s 18 but he put Billy in a lot of unnecessary risky situations. -the pacing; I struggled to maintain my interest in the meandering streams of consciousness/backstories/anecdotes/preachy shit. A whole lot a book highway that didn’t take this reader very far. ⭐️⭐️⭐️"
727,5.0,"Amor Towles is a fantastic storyteller. He tells his stories through layers upon layers and has the beautiful ability of showing humanity in even the most complicated of characters. Even though this was a long novel, I was sad to have it end. Speaking of endings..... so much to digest there!"
728,5.0,"It's been a while since I have felt so captivated by a plot- Amor Towles absolutely took me for a ride in this epic story. Each character is so unique and I loved each and every one of them (minus maybe one...Pastor John *cough cough*). I loved that every chapter was narrated by a different character and that only made me love them more! I could picture it all so well in my head. This book made me crave adventure in the best way possible, it made me question and reflect on judgements made without recognition, and most of all it made me a dreamer, if only for a little while...(Thanks Billy). "
729,5.0,"The Lincoln Highway is truly a marvel! I loved every character, I loved the story, I loved the life lessons…..I can’t remember ever having so much fun, reading a book. Amor Towles, you are a literary genius!"
730,5.0,"This is the 3rd book by this author that I've read, and it's the first one I loved. No doubt this author is gifted when it comes to having a way with words. I loved, loved that part. This one was beautiful in that respect. The one thing that took this one to the 5 star level for me was the cast of characters. They were all different in characteristics and purpose. Duchess and the drifter provided the necessary WTF moments as they kept pace along side the bright shine of the 'Leave-it to Beaver-esque' kids. The contrast was stark and I loved it.The ending wasn't my favorite but I still thoroughly enjoyed this one. So 5 stars."
731,5.0,"What an adventure! This novel of a 1954 road trip simply oozes nostalgia. While it’s a hefty tome (nearly 600 pages), it’s an easy-to-read story that flies by like the landscape outside of a Studebaker’s window. I love these characters, with all of their quirks and their flaws. The adventure takes place over just 10 days with multiple narrators, and is some of the richest storytelling that I have enjoyed in a while. "

733,3.0,"I don’t tend to go for road trip novels, but I read this one because I really like Towles’s writing. I’m so impressed by how extremely different each of his books is from the others. And the writing is of course extremely engaging. That ending though! Ice cold. Of course Lenny (I mean cough Woolly) had to die, but Mike (I mean Duchess) too? I was looking forward to the confrontation between Duchess and his father, even though Duchess was driving me nuts throughout the book, I did kind of want him to make it to tinsel town one day…. "
734,5.0,Where do I even begin?? I am in awe. AWE! After loving A Gentleman In Moscow so much I was a little worried about being disappointed. But that couldn't be further from my experience. Such a marvelous treat. Towles never wastes a single word. I am definitely buying this for myself because it must be on my shelf forever.
735,2.0,"It pains me to have to go against the grain and say I found this book to be pretty bad.  I say that with no ill will.  It's just that I'm a bit stunned by it all.  Amor Towles is one of my absolute favorite authors (and thus I couldn't bear to give it one star).  A Gentleman in Moscow was one of the most quietly moving books I've ever read.  For me, though, The Lincoln Highway--without having the energy to go into all the details of why--read like a 1950s Americana/coming of age caricature.  Nonetheless, I'm sure I'll enthusiastically dive into whatever comes from Towles next."
738,3.0,"The Lincoln Highway is one of the earliest transcontinental highway routes for automobiles across the United States of America. Conceived in 1912 by Indiana entrepreneur Carl G. Fisher, and formally dedicated October 31, 1913, the Lincoln Highway ran coast-to-coast from Times Square in New York City west to Lincoln Park in San Francisco. Listed on the New York Times bestseller list I took a stab at reading it. Boy was I disappointed.Those hoping for a classic road trip novel that the cover promised it to be will be disappointed as Towles instead decides to ditch the intended plot for a lengthy laborious cat and mouse storyline that takes up the entire novel. In June, 1954, 18-year-old Emmett Watson is driven home to Nebraska by the warden of the juvenile work farm where he has just served 15 months for involuntary manslaughter. His mother long gone, his father recently deceased, and the family farm foreclosed upon by the bank, Emmett's intention is to pick up his eight-year-old brother, Billy, and head to California where they can start their lives anew. But when the warden drives away, Emmett discovers that two friends from the work farm have hidden themselves in the trunk of the warden's car. Together, they have hatched an altogether different plan for Emmett's future, one that will take them all on a fateful journey in the opposite direction to the City of New York . For the first third I was enthralled it was like being wrapped on a warm blanket as I was lead along the path with Emmett, Billy et al. Lovely descriptive writing as the story gently unfolded. Four stars at this pointFor the second third I was starting to get restless as the most unlikely of co-incidences and escapades carried on. Three stars here. In the final third the plot became tedious as the protagonists pinged from one unbelievable event to another. By the end I was thinking for goodness sake just get on with it !!! 1-2 stars. It is the adventures of these individuals that seem to never end and when you feel like something will happen Towles gives you another twist to the story and you the reader will hit numerous pot holes that never end. If you have ever road the Lincoln Highway it is quite wonderful in places, but also very dull at times. If Towles intention for his novel was to actually reflect a journey along the Lincoln Highway, a trip that is surely lengthy, monotonous, and exhausting, then he has succeeded with style."
739,4.0,"This was my first Amor Towles book, and that being the case, I really didn’t know what to expect. My first impression, which was the lack of quotation marks around the dialogue (😑), was a bit off putting. But even so, within a few pages I could tell that this was going to be a good one. This is a highly character driven story. The plot feels like just a way to get to know the people you meet in the story, as opposed to the main focus of the book, and when it’s done well (which is the case here) it leads to an awesome reading experience. I couldn’t quite give the book five stars, as something about it left me unsatisfied in the end. I didn’t dislike the ending, but I think I just wanted something more from it. But regardless, I loved it, and if you like character driven stories I highly recommend it.Oh and I eventually got at least sort of used to no quotation marks (though honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever be a fan of that). 🥴😂"
740,2.0,"Obviously I am an outlier here, but I wish I had not read this book. I almost abandoned it twice because of its comic book violence (hitting someone upside the head with a 2 x 4? hitting someone else with a frying pan?! Two more people with shovels?!!!). I wish I had stopped reading, because now I am questioning what I liked about Towles' first two novels. These characters are hackneyed stereotypes, especially the women, like the dewy sex worker with a heart of gold (named Charity, no less), and the endearingly brilliant kid brother. This is a picaresque novel, but whereas the genre usually exposes social foibles, this is loaded with anachronisms and contrivedly symbolic. (One character is told to carry a railroad spike as part of his quest. In 1956.) The kindness we appreciate in Towles' novels is here, but this meandering road trip with its sudden plot twists on the last pages seemed self-indulgent and almost cynical. "
741,5.0,"How does one review this gem of a book, a large story with many pages but I buzzed through it!!Amor Towles sure knows how to tell a story & there are so many wonderful layers to this book. I loved the book, loved the characters & there are many. No need to rehash the story, many reviews out there & I won't do it justice.Thank you 

 for being the author you are!"
742,5.0,"Done reading this massive book, 576 pages long, and I thought The Lincoln Highway is brilliant in every sense of the word. A family affair, a travelogue, a coming-of-age saga, a grand adventure both real and mythological and lastly a really affecting look at the interplay of lives both young and old, the innocent and the guilty, the events we can and we cannot control and the things that matters most. Amor Towles has created characters to root for with tender humor and incredible wit. His prose is classy, sophisticated and just mesmerizing. The Lincoln Highway brims with surprises, audacity, and empathy - plus it's super fun to read. One of the very best I read this year!"
743,4.0,"4+ stars. Reading this book was so enjoyable that I will now re-visit ""A Gentleman in Moscow."""
744,5.0,"Amor Towles is three for three on five-star reads for me. The depth of his characters, the arc of his storylines, and the way he writes - oh, the way he writes, I love it. What a magnificent piece of literary fiction this book is. "
745,5.0,"TITLE: The Lincoln HighwayAUTHOR: Amor TowlesPUB DATE: 10.05.2021AUDIO: Penguin Random House AudioNARRATED BY: Edoardo Ballerini, Cathy Marin, and Dion GrahamLENGTH: 16 hrs 40 minAmor Towles’ The Lincoln Highway, a fantastic follow up to his best-selling novel “A Gentleman in Moscow” satisfied my longing for a nostalgic read that is set in the 1950’s. the Lincoln Highway is an epic adventure about brothers Emmett, an 18yo who has just returned home to Nebraska after serving a sentence at a juvenile work farm (he accidentally killed another boy in a fight), and younger brother Billy as they set on a cross country trip by way of the Lincoln Highway to San Francisco after their farm has foreclosed and father passing away. But their plans to head to California derail time and time again as misfits and fellow juveniles Duchess and Woolly gets in the way, and where they meet characters - some of whom they will never forget, while some they wish to have never met at all.The writing was visually immersive, engaging, and thought provoking. I loved reading this almost 600 pages of a novel that I just did not want to end. The audio book was narrated with the perfect voices for the characters by none other than Edoardo Ballerini, Cathy Marin, and Dion Graham. They definitely added to the bringing this story to life. The audio is simply incredible.Thank you @prhaudio for the gifted audiobook"
746,5.0,"I am the perfect audience for this author I did not like this as much as two others by Towles, and I did have a few criticisms, but none that significantly took away from how much I enjoy the work of Amor Towles.Paromjit, and Diane S wrote otstanding reviews ( no big surprise there) for this title."
747,5.0,"I LOVED this book. As an emphatic fan of Amor Towles' two other books, I knew that I'd have high expectations for this one. I was a little skeptical that I'd be as enthusiastic about a group of four young boys on a road trip across the country in the 50's, but I shouldn't have been. This book was magic, and I don't think I've ever read an almost-600 page book so quickly. As I mentioned before, this book is about a journey taken by four young boys (and a host of other delightful characters), but not in the way that you'd think. There is a literal trek across the country, obviously, but this book is just as much about the hero's journey as it is about the miles travelled, and with the four main POVs, you get to see each different arc the characters take and invest equally in all of them. I don't want to get too into plot because I want everyone I know to have the same fresh reading experience that I did, but I will say that Towles' ability to interweave plot points and bring themes back again in inventive ways is absolutely masterful. At this point, if Amor Towles wrote an 800+ page tome about the life of a pill bug, I'd pre-order it today. I adored all of the characters in this book, and I could not have been more devoted to discovering the fates of each one, even when they left me devastated. The writing is incredible, the voice is distinctive, and Towles makes you love characters even when they make the most frustrating of decisions (here's looking at you, Duchess). Read this, read this, read this. I promise you will love it. "
748,5.0,"A madcap character driven story. This is BY FAR one of my favorite reads. I will quote The Washington Post: “The Lincoln Highway” is a long and winding road, but one Towles’s motley crew navigates with brains, heart and courage. The novel embraces the contradictions of our character with a skillful hand, guiding the reader forward with “a sensation of floating — like one who’s being carried down a wide river on a warm summer day.” Billy read like Scout Finch to me. I wanted to dislike Duchess but just couldn't. His back story made it all clear 😢. Ulysses made me cry and hope for him. Emmett and Woolly were wonderful but oh Wolly 😢 and Sally is the feminist we all need. These characters are so real, so lovable - just like the Count in A Gentleman in Moscow. Towles characters talk to me. EVERY word is necessary and no words are wasted. It read like a fable, poetry to me. I did not want it to end."
749,5.0,"1950s America -- a simpler but not an easier time than the ones in which we now live. Compared to these days of instant communication, 24-hour news cycles, and social media, people, in general, were more naive/innocent. I felt those same things as I read The Lincoln Highway. Towles captured the era perfectly.If you're hoping to read a travelogue, this isn't the story for you. The Lincoln Highway, America's first coast-to-coast highway is the backbone of the story, true enough, but it is the young men who traverse the highway that drive this story.It is a tale of hope, of coming of age, of an old person's wisdom in young men's hearts, of trials and errors. It is beautiful and poignant.For me, this is a book that I will read over and over again in the years to come. It is every bit as magnificent as A Gentleman in Moscow."
750,5.0,"I was nervous to start this. I adored A Gentleman in Moscow, but it took ages to read. This is a totally different flavor. It’s an adventure story, and it grabs you by the collar and pulls you along. Don’t be intimidated by how long this book is; it is fabulous. "
751,5.0,"Towles has done it again. What an incredibly thought out, well written and exciting novel. From the very get-go, I knew I was going to like this. Each and every character was real and raw, I felt their hopes and heartaches as if they were my own. The dynamics between said characters was also perfect, not a single interaction felt forced or unnatural. Towles has a gift for drawing you in and keeping you entertained, every single page was full of excitement. The plot, albeit it was a little slow at first, picked up and every side character, every side story, connected and made so much sense by the end. There were certain quotes that took me off guard like a gut punch and had me reeling from the emotions of it all. By the end, I was left in awe of the masterpiece I had just read.Thank you to NetGalley and the publishers for kindly providing an ARC in exchange for an honest review. #TheLincolnHighway #NetGalley. All opinions are my own"
752,4.0,I did not see the ending coming until it arrived. It didn’t satisfy me and didn’t work for me. Maybe because it road such a fine line between comedy and tragedy and I found it leaning more toward comedy. That said… Parts of this book were just so good. It made me smile at times and I appreciate how creative Towles is and how this tale is held together even with so many moving parts. (Loved the part about how men wrote the Bible as evidenced by the story of Martha. I’ve always felt the same…)
753,3.0,"Lost boys on a cross-country road trip in the 1950’s with sepia-toned adventures and life lessons along the way. After 200 pages, I’d had enough, skipped the next 300 pages and picked up at the end to see if it got more interesting. Barely. Ostentatiously quirky characters, tiresomely charming. Reads like YA. Not for me."
754,3.0,"The Lincoln Highway by Amor Towels First of all I want to say I don’t like long books. If you’re wondering why I would read this almost 600 page brick, I thought I would love love love this book since the synopsis reminded me of This Tender Land. When my Book of the Month box got delivered and I saw how huge this book was I immediately requested the audiobook from library. The narrators were wonderful so I definitely recommend the audio. To me, this book was just way too long. It takes place over ten days and I was more invested than some character’s narration than others. Some parts were really fast paced and interesting and some bored me to tears. If you don’t mind long stories and you have strong arms, I’d pick this up. If you’re a weakling like me and don’t like reading a giant physical book, grab the audio or ebook! ⭐️⭐️⭐️"
755,2.0,"Such a disappointment. It started out okay and then became more fantasy than reality. To me, it seems more suited to teenagers than adults. "
756,2.0,"This book moves at a glacial speed to nowhere. Towles takes an interesting concept and then murders it by diverting so far from what makes this book intriguing, reaching the mother in San Francisco, that I totally lost interest. Telling the story from multiple points of view can work but is not effective in this book. Towles fails to utilize the multiple vantage points to add any depth of character and by using this writing technique he breaks any momentum he builds which magnifies the slow pacing. "
757,1.0,"Thank god it's over. What a waste of time. I can't believe I read the whole 571 pages in less than a week. Not because it was spellbinding or good but because I couldn't believe that someone actually took the time to write such meaningless, endless drivel. I think I know that the plot follows in the form of a hero myth but it takes so many diversions that you lose the flow.Most frustrating is the author's style. Dialogue not encapsulated in quotation marks. Chapters (and speakers) jumping between 15 or 20 characters. The characters have a role in the story but often for some extraneous reason. One character's name usually enclosed for some unexplained reason in quotation marks (only his and always except for one chapter).Sorry, Amor, I have to say that the hours reading is better spent elsewhere."
758,2.0,"It only took me 5 days to read this book but not because I loved it, I just wanted to get it over and done with… Not ideal.At nearly 600 pages my proof copy was hefty enough to give me killer shoulder pain, but sadly it wasn’t quite worth it all. I didn’t connect with the characters at any point, and the narrative structure didn’t help — why did there have to be so many POVs?? My copy also had a chunk of 30-odd pages missing towards the end, which didn’t exactly add to my reading pleasure. I also really thought this would be a road trip novel, but the trip across America I imagined never actually happened.Thank you to the publisher for my advance review copy. "
759,5.0,"Summary: A westward trip of two bereaved brothers to start a new life is interrupted when two prison friends of the older brother turn up and hi-jack their plans.I will say straight out that I think this is one of the best road novels I’ve ever read–leaving Kerouac’s On the Road in the metaphorical dust. Towles allows this journey to unfold rather than pursue the frenetic pace of Kerouac. The adolescent characters have dreams toward which they strive, despite the cards dealt them in life, and while not saints, evidence principles and loyalties not evident in Kerouac’s dissolute young adults who still act the like immature adolescents.The novel opens in June of 1954 with a warden driving Emmett Watson home on early release from Salinas, a juvenile detention center to which he’d been sentenced for the accidental manslaughter of a young man who struck his head when knocked down by Emmett, retaliating for insults to his family. He has returned because his father had died of cancer, his mother had long ago abandoned the family, and he is the only one to care for his precocious, eight-year old brother Billy. Billy has been looked after by a young neighbor woman, Sally, who has spent her life looking after the men in her life and wants something more.Emmett realizes staying in his small Nebraska town is not a good idea. He has enemies and a cloud over his head and his father’s farm has been seized by the bank. He envisions a new start with Billy, driving away in his powder blue Studebaker to use his construction skills somewhere that is growing. He thinks Texas, but Billy thinks California, where he hopes to find his mother, based on the trail of postcards she’d sent. Billy has mapped out the route that follows the coast-to-coast Lincoln Highway that runs close to their home. They hope to make it by the July 4 fireworks in San Francisco. Billy’s mother loved fireworks, having left the day after a local display.Their plans are interrupted when two fellow inmates from Salinas, Duchess and “Woolly,” show up on Emmett’s doorstep. They had escaped in the trunk of the warden’s car. “Duchess” was the son of a theatrical performer who betrayed him to the authorities to escape arrest. “Woolly” suffers some form of cognitive impairment requiring medication to keep him mellow. They want Emmett and Billy to drive them to New York to retrieve a $150,000 trust fund that has been withheld from Woolly, that they offer to split three ways.Emmett will have none of it. He and Billy pack their kit bags (Billy with Abacus Abernathe’s compendium of heroic stories that he has read 24 times already). They plan to drop the other two at a bus station, but Duchess, who always seems to have other ideas, creates a diversion at the orphanage he once lived in, then steals the Studebaker, and with Woolly takes off for New York, with $3,000 that Emmett’s father had left him, stowed behind the spare tire.Emmett and Billy, nearly penniless, decide to pursue them the only way they can, by hopping a freight train, and the race is on to intercept them in New York, to retrieve the Studebaker, and hopefully the money, and then take the Lincoln Highway from coast to coast, fulfilling a dream of Billy’s. They make it to New York with the help and protection of a fellow hobo, Ulysses, who left his wife and son after the war and has been wandering ever since. Billy, reads him the story of Ulysses from Professor Abernathe’s book, and in a series of events, Professor Abernathe and Ulysses meet, discussing whether this Ulysses might be reunited with his wife as was the Ulysses of mythology. This encounter, catalyzed by Billy, was one of the high points of the book, capturing the arc of failure, struggle and hope each character pursues.While all this happens, Emmett pursues Duchess and his car. But he’s not the only one pursuing. Sally, fed up with waiting for them to call to say they’ve arrived safely, and fed up with her domestic life, takes off in pursuit of them.All of these characters are striving against thwarted destinies to make something of their lives. Billy wants to find the mother who left him. Emmett wants to use construction skills to make a life in a new place by re-habbing and flipping houses, not unlike what he’d been doing before prison. Sally is tired of doing for other men and wants to do for herself. Duchess envisions owning a restaurant like one in which he worked. And Woolly? It seems he would string together a life of “perfect days” untroubled by the demands of his station in life. The Lincoln Highway goes both east and west. Sometimes you have to go backward to go forward, as in the chapter numbering of this book. Sometimes, to get to California, you have to go through New York, uncertain whether you will make your way back, but continuing to hope."
760,3.0,"Amor Towles' latest features two young brothers, an older teenager and a pre-teen, who set out from Nebraska to go to San Francisco where the younger brother has hopes of finding their mother who left them years earlier. Their father has recently died and their home, a farm, is being foreclosed by the bank which holds the mortgage. They have to go somewhere and San Francisco seems like a good option.It is June 1954 and eighteen-year-old Emmett Watson has just been driven home by the warden of the work farm where he was sentenced after being found guilty of involuntary manslaughter. His sentence has been reduced because of his father's death and the fact that his eight-year-old brother, Billy, has no other family to care for him. Emmett has a 1948 Studebaker Land Cruiser that he had bought with wages earned as a carpenter before being sentenced. His plan was to take his brother and head to Texas where he thought there would be work for a carpenter and he could support the two of them. Billy, though, is dead set on California and after some research at the library, Emmett decides that there's work for carpenters in California as well, so San Francisco, here they come!Well, not quite.Before they can hit the road on the Lincoln Highway, two of Emmett's friends from the work farm, Duchess and Woolly, show up, having hidden themselves in the trunk of the warden's car. They have escaped and now Duchess has a plan to get Emmett to take them to New York where Woolly, who is estranged from his wealthy family, will be able to access money left to him by his grandfather. Woolly is an innocent with a good heart and some undefined psychological problem for which he takes medication. Duchess is a user of people and I disliked him from his first ""Ta-da!"" I never changed that opinion even after I learned some of his sad history. Emmett is not interested in going to New York. He's ready to head west.Unable to persuade Emmett, Duchess steals (""borrows"") his car, and he and Woolly head to New York, stranding Emmett and Billy. Naturally, all the money they had was in the trunk of the car, so they are left with no money and no transportation. They manage to hop a freight train and head to New York to find Duchess and Woolly and the car. Easy peasy, right? That was just one of the things about the book's plot that stretched my credulity.Emmett and Billy are fortunate in finding friendly people along the way who help them out. After they leave, Sally, the young woman who had cared for Billy before Emmett was released, decided that she would drive to New York to find Billy and Emmett, and of course, she does, and of course, they do get the money (of Woolly's) that Duchess had promised. But there are a couple of tragedies that happen before the two brothers can finally head west on the Lincoln Highway. I loved Towles' A Gentleman in Moscow and I dearly wanted to love this one, too, but I just couldn't. I can't really explain why but it never really ""grabbed"" me. I felt it was a bit long and could have used a stricter editor. The story seemed repetitive and it got a bit tiresome for me. I started with a lot of empathy for the brothers, for young Billy particularly, but as the plot advanced, his constant perkiness just began to irritate me. It's certainly not a bad book, and I know many readers have really liked it, and I guess I liked it well enough but just not as much as I was expecting to."
761,5.0,"Amor Towles blew me away with this A Gentleman in Moscow and this year’s The Lincoln Highway blew me there and back. To read this book is like settling into a soft chair with a cool drink, and you won’t want to get up until you’re finished. When I picked up this book I was so ready to fall in love with some new characters -- the last few reads hadn’t delivered in that department -- and Towle’s characters came off the page ready to be loved. From Emmett, the Greek hero (this comparison isn’t my invention – Towles frame the whole story around Homer’s The Odyssey, but if you’re like me and you can’t remember a word of it [last read in Junior High School] it doesn’t matter. Towles gentles us along through the eyes of Emmett’s eight-year-old brother Billy, who is on the trail of heroes and happy to explain to anyone who asks just what a Greek hero is, and what a Greek drama requires of him). Every good hero has to have a sidekick, and here we get two, each as quirky and fatally flawed as you could wish. The girl next door, Sally, refuses to sit at home and wait, and so of course we fall for Sally too. And never forget the charming scribe, or the odyssey itself, the cross-country trip via car, freight train, more cars, and foot. But Towles is so gifted at storytelling that just when you feel it’s time to stop you moving, you stop.One last word -- if this review is sounding a little too academic (translation: boring) just stop reading the review and read the book. I promise you won’t regret it. "
762,5.0,"4.5 stars. This is a book that I love almost perfectly. I found the first 475 pages or so absolutely delightful. It had so many clever and wise lines, and I could never quite anticipate what would happen next. It was so different from what I expected it to be. But in the last 100 pages, Towles took a figurative (but nearly literal) page out of Steinbeck’s book that immediately darkened the story and threw it in a much less pleasant direction. I truly would have been much happier if the book had just continued on its merry way to the end. Nevertheless, despite the darkened tone, that cleverness I appreciated so much in the rest of the book was present through the end. I can also look back now and both see and appreciate the foreshadowing crafted throughout the book that I didn’t quite catch onto being there until the end. I now find myself wishing the story continued because I would love to know how all the characters’ lives (both major and minor) end up!"
763,5.0,"In a world where every published book has the grandest superlatives on the back cover and is rated 5-star by more than a quarter of the reviewers, it is difficult to describe a timeless classic. This is that one.Mr. Towles decides to verbalize life with a handful of ordinary folks. Each is brilliant in their way, with the desire to be good, get more out of life, and the need to escape the reality heaped on them. Circumstances conjured allow the author to spray delightful quotes every few paragraphs, but that is never the purpose.Each of the tales and character behavior will force readers to think of themselves in similar circumstances. One would develop a renewed appreciation of small joys and casual interactions while learning how difficult circumstances, alternatives, and feelings are for many of us. If the review site had a special rating that could be assigned to only one book after reviewing any hundred, The Lincoln Highway will be a contender in any such list for me."
764,5.0,"Fantastic. Although a different Genre it is similar to Name of the Wind. I was so involved with the characters, I was emotionally drained after reading it. Its what Clouid Cuckoo Land wants to be when it grows up."
765,4.0,"4.5 StarsAmor Towles is an eloquent and thoughtful novelist. He takes his time with story and character, letting everything coalesce into something that encompasses the most profound wisdom from the Western canon. The Lincoln Highway is about an American road trip, but begins to feel like The Odyssey as Emmett Watson's best laid plans get complicated by his so-called friends, Duchess and Woolly. As soon as Duchess takes off in Emmett's car, I groaned. It's 1954. How will Emmett track down his car and Duchess now? It's a road trip gone wrong revealed in multiple view points. It's not as tidy as A Gentleman in Moscow, but Towles' road trip novel feels lighter, less dense. I have complicated feelings about the ending, but I was here for the journey."
766,3.0,"OMG, I thought it would never end. The blurb calls this book propulsive. I call this book sprawling (in many different, random directions) and jaw-cracking yawn inducing. It seemed like there was a lot going on. Yet, I felt like I was constantly waiting for something to happen. Characters that started out vivid turned caricatural by the end. The multiple perspectives added nothing but repetition to the story. I mean, how many times did I have to hear about the mudroom of the lake house?! So why three stars instead of say … one or two? I did like the writing. It was an engaging style and I can appreciate that. This is my first Amor Towles novel and I’m still curious about his first two books. I’ll likely give at least one of them a chance. Call me a glutton for punishment."
767,5.0,"Thank you to NetGalley, Viking, & Penguin Publishing Group for the opportunity to read and review this book before it's publication date! This in no way affected my review, opinions are my own.

This. Book. Was. Amazing.Some background (some necessary, some not): I read Rules of Civility back in 2012 (WHOA) and it has been a book that I happily recommended to people throughout the years, because I remembered really liking it (although present day Lindsey doesn't remember specifics because 2012 Lindsey was a jerk and didn't keep a book journal or write a review).I have had A Gentleman in Moscow on my shelves since it was published in 2016 (still unread, naturally).And now I've read The Lincoln Highway (pubs Oct 5th!) and it's definitely a contender for favorite book of the year.//This is how I described in a message to a friend and it still feels accurate so I'm going to add it in here: if you enjoy coming of age stories / unreliable narrators / literary fiction / incredible characters / historical fiction / multi-layered generational stories / beautiful prose / pages upon pages of highlightable quotes / multiple narrators / family stories ... then you need this book!I loved every part of this book - but most especially how singularly real it felt while I was reading, as if I could close my eyes and open them to find Duchess, Wooly, Emmett, and Billy standing in front of me, opening the door to Emmett's 1948 Studebaker Land Cruiser so I could come along on the trip.The hardest part about how much I loved it was not being able to talk to my husband about it, because I so desperately want him to get to experience this for himself. It's THAT good.Man alive, I just really LOVED this book. It would also make a FANTASTIC book club book - I'm considering making one and choosing this book for our inaugural read and then talking to a bunch of people about how much we all loved it and then just not going back after that. Seems doable. And fair to everyone else, because I suck at book clubs. Yeah. I'll do that.Content Warnings: (view spoiler)[Parental Abandonment, Mental Illness, Gaslighting, Suicide, Assault, Racism, Potentially Narcissistic / Sociopathic Behavior?

768,3.0,"After reading his excellent A Gentleman in Moscow it wasn't hard for me to decide to listen to this audiobook. One of the things that I really liked when I read Gentleman in Moscow was the humour Count Alexander Rostov uses to alleviate his situation and how he is able to overcome his captors and find freedom.So, did Amor Towles recreate this same feeling? The answer is, yes and no. Yes in the sense that this book recreates the same atmosphere that I had during Gentleman in Moscow. The storytelling is lively, engaging, has great characters and takes the reader on a wild ride as it twists and turns away. It is a Great American Road Novel where four boys learn some insights and thruths on life in general, while switching between different viewpoints. No in the sense that the story itself falls flat, and that I had sometimes the feeling to get on with the story, after encountering yet another twist and new character which only took away from the main storyline.But perhaps it was not about the story at all, but just about the lively characters, from good to evil. In that sense this was a great book, and I am sure Amor Towles has a lot more in store for us."
769,5.0,"I mainly decided to read this because it seemed to be getting a lot of buzz. The premise seemed interesting enough so I thought, ""Eh I'll check it out."" Turns out the buzz is well warranted. It's a fantastic book, epic but also just the story of three men and a kid (and others) scrambling to do what they all think is right. I had a brief moment of ""Wait, that's where it's ending...?"" when the book was over, but even just sitting with it for a little while convinced me it was a solid conclusion.A full five stars despite the annoying lack of quotations around dialogue (the author did include a - before someone spoke, which I guess is better than nothing. Marginally). Definitely one of the best books of 2021."
770,2.0,I am in the minority but I just didn’t love the story. It is well written but Rules of Civility is still my favorite. 
771,2.0,"DNF. 28%. An impossibly moral teen and his equally impossibly intelligent younger brother go on a cliche filled adventure that feels like it was written for 14-year-olds. It's not exactly awful but considering that I was groaning at least once every few minutes, I was never going to be able to last 600 pages."
772,5.0,"One of my most anticipated releases 0f 2021 along with Klara and the Sun and I'm happy to say it did not disappoint. We follow multiple perspectives, but I'd say two are the main ones: Emmett and Duchess, both out of a youth facility in Kansas. Emmett's out early due to his father's passing and Duchess is trying to be the hero who saves Wooly (another boy from the facility). Emmett kind of goes with the flow, but the reader knows or expects Duchess to have some ulterior motive to do what he does. They end up taking The Lincoln Highway but where are these 3 musketeers off to, California or New York? I struggled a bit with Billy, how's an 8-year-old kid so smart, so all-knowing in history and all sorts of things at such a young age? A lot of the time, he seems smarter than all the adults around him combined. While I do know kids are smart, how smart? A good way into the book I decided to suspend my disbelief in Billy and just enjoy his spirit and guidance of his beloved red adventure book. I will say though that I'd have expected to see a bit of grief on his father's passing and leaving the family home behind no matter how exciting the upcoming adventure may seem, or, am I expecting too much from an 8-year-old? Billy and Emmett's mother remains an enigma much as I was hoping to get to know her. Sally is the only female character as Wooly's sister only makes a brief appearance. Whilst I did like Sally a lot, including her seemed a bit of an afterthought, like we need someone to watch over Billy or get Emmett out of trouble, so here's Sally. I'd have loved to get to know her a bit better as she does have the potential to be a fascinated character. The edition I own (independent bookshop edition, I ordered a signed copy from Booka Bookshop from the UK) includes a Q&A with the author. Now, this is something I'd usually skip altogether or just skim through, but I'm glad I read it on this occasion as Towles explains coming up with the idea as a complete opposite to his other books, Rules of Civility and A Gentleman in Moscow, an idea of an 18-year-old boy being driven home and The Lincoln Highway tied it all together. There's an extensive explanation on this being over 10 days in 1954 America, an America coming out of the war and heading into, but a country in which a lot is going on. Now obviously, I did not live at that time, but I felt like I was there and that's good writing indeed. Compliments to the author yet again. I'm excited at the mention of him working on something very different next, I'll be here for it and I'll also preorder a signed copy. Overall, this book was a recipe for success as looking at books I've rated highly or loved recently, they're all multiple POS with some historical or fantasy elements and interesting characters. As unlikely as I found some scenes (mostly Billy ones) the writing is so good (no surprise after loving Amor's other books) that I have to rate this 5 stars. So many sticky tabs were used. I'm not quite sure whether it'll make it to my top 10 of 2021 yet, but it was definitely a fantastic read."
773,3.0,"The Homeric journey is a staple of literature through all the ages, and Towles used the trope enthusiastically for the Fool’s Journey of three young men. Teens, really, at age eighteen--straight out of a juvie type work camp. It was a bit hokey and folksy for my taste, however. It teetered on a YA style, voice. I was planning on loving it as much as A Gentleman in Moscow and Rules of Civility, but was disappointed in the approach and pandering.Emmett, the main character, is set to take his 8 year-old brother, Billy, on the open road in his Studebaker, now that he’s out of the work camp (for accidentally causing the death of a bully). When his dad died, the warden suspended the rest of his time and drove him back home to Nebraska to his eight-year-old brother, Billy. He and Billy plan to head to California in Emmett’s Studebaker to fulfill Billy’s dream of finding their mother and setting down roots. But two others from the juvie camp, Duchess and Woolly, have escaped by hiding in the warden’s trunk. Duchess “borrows” the Studebaker after plans were made for Emmett to drop them off back at the camp. Duchess hatches a plan to get them rich, and proceeds from that desire. Thus the journey is disrupted. Along the way, Billy and Emmett find themselves on a train, meeting a host of quirky characters.Billy has the brains and wisdom of a 40-year-old, which made it difficult for me to suspend belief. Emmett, seemed rather flat to me. I didn’t feel that the author differentiated the various voices clearly, so I was grateful for the chapters titled in the characters’ names. Overall, the plot seemed gimmicky and there were too many clichés for a writer of this caliber, as well as repetitive filler bloating the story. Moreover, I was expecting an open road kind of journey, but that came up short. It read more like a love letter to NYC under cover of its Midwest folksiness, and that bothered me. It was sentimental, with a gotcha type of ending that couldn’t possibly be anticipated, even if it was clever. And Towles also utilized tokenism, which tends to make me cringe. I’ll let the reader pluck that out, or whether it is notable to other readers.Despite my disappointment, I did finish the entire book. The plot made it impossible for me to abandon it, because I wanted to know how it turned out. I think this will appeal to adolescents more than adults who crave the literature that Towles gave us in the past. But, I’ll still be in line for the author’s next book.2.75 rounded up"
774,4.0,"3.5 rounded upI really liked Rules of Civility and A Gentleman in Moscow. This book did not grab me in the same way. I enjoyed it and it was great in audio.This book is set during a 10-day period in 1954, but the characters' backstories convey the reader back as well. This is very much an early 50's story. I can see the young men in this story wearing jeans (or dungarees as they would have been called in 1954) and white cotton T-shirts with cigarettes rolled up in the sleeve. This is an adventure story, mostly about boys although Sally provides (in a much too short role) a female perspective. The story starts almost in the middle of the country. Emmett Watson, 18 years old, has been released early from a juvenile work camp because his father, a failed farmer, has died and there is no one else to care for his 8-year old brother Billy. The bank has foreclosed on the farm and the banker is waiting for Emmett when the warden drops him off. Emmett does save his 1948 baby-blue Studebaker from the banks clutches. There being no reason to stay, Emmett has decided they should go to Texas, but Billy (and the library) convince Emmett to go to San Francisco and try to find their mother, who left the farm shortly after Billy was born. Billy wants to take the Lincoln Highway, the route his mother took, the first road to run across the continent, from Times Square to San Francisco. Billy is a lover of adventures. The Librarian gifted him with a copy of Prof. Abacus Abernathe's ""Heroes, Adventurers and Other Intrepid Travelers and by the end of the book, he's read it cover to cover over 20 times and is ready to add an adventure to the pages at the end of the book for just that purpose.But the best laid plans of mice and men go astray. Two friends of Emmett's ""hitched"" a ride in the warden's trunk -- Duchess and Woolly -- and they want Emmett to go with them to Upper New York state to retrieve Woolly's inheritance. Emmett says no. He will drop them at the train station. Duchess, however, puts one over on Emmett and ""borrows"" the Studebaker, leaving Emmett and Billy sitting high and dry with the nuns at the orphanage. Emmett and Billy go after them, jumping a supple train for NYC.Many adventures are had, many disasters are averted, and many new characters are met on the 10-day journey to retrieve the Studebaker - I'd say perhaps a few too many. "
775,3.0,"Okay, to start with, it's a book by Amor Towles ~ it's not going to be crap! We all know that. But this was definitely not the book I ""thought"" it was going to be. I mean the title is ""The Lincoln Highway"" so that leads one to believe the characters might be cruising along ON said highway. Ha. Not so. In actuality, the time spent on the Lincoln Highway could be condensed to perhaps ten minutes of reading. Honestly tho, whether we were going to be reading about a cross country trip on the Lincoln Highway, building the highway, planning it, whatever, it was a no brainer for me to download it. The author has just made a fan out of me in that way. I've also come to expect Mr. Towles to write in the diamond style he had Abacus Abernathe describing (the author of Billy's big red book of heroes.) He always starts at one point then goes wide with his tangents and characters before narrowing back in (normally) to a startling, unexpected conclusion. Let's just say he went REALLY WIDE here. So many, many, MANY characters and POV's. Were they all really necessary?? What did we get out of Sally?? or Paster John?? or all of Duchesses childhood acquaintances?? Just to name a few... It's hard to even think of Emmet as the main character when all the other people we were introduced to along the way received equal time. It might be best to settle back and read this book like you would drink a fine whiskey; unhurriedly, savoring every note (i.e. character) and with infinite patience to see where it leads. Definitely don't expect anything fast paced. The ending was not as satisfying to me as I wanted or expected it to be. I almost felt the author had Emmet commit murder (knowing Duchess could not swim) which would be totally out of character for the young man we came to know. Did anyone else feel that way?? Wasn't it hard to remember he was only 18??I'm perfectly certain I'll never remember all the people in the book but I will remember the Lincoln Highway, why it was built, that there's a lot of statues of Abraham Lincoln in strategic locations along the route, etc., etc. It was illuminating in that respect. Was that the purpose and everything else just filler???  or perhaps it was reinforcement that life's a journey and never goes as planned...."
776,5.0,"Emmett, just turned 18, is released from a reform school a few months early to attend his father’s funeral at his home in Nebraska. He decides that he and his eight-year-old brother, Billy, need a new start and so plan to head to California. Two inmates, Duchess - think Artful Dodger or Huck Finn - and Wooly show up with other plans. So begins an enjoyable 10 day trip as creative as the odyssey, filled with amazing people, sights, experiences, laughter and tears. This book is absorbing and lots of fun - I didn’t want it to stop. So, hop into the Studebaker and enjoy a ride on the Lincoln Highway. One thing though, what does Towles have against New Jersey?"
777,5.0,"I loved this book. I read the ending really fast because everything was coming to a head and I couldn't leave the characters where they were in the story, or wait to see which path the characters would take. I loved all the characters and the plot and the descriptions of 1954 America. There were so many great observations about life within these pages. I'm tempted to skim it again and highlight all my favorite parts. I'll be thinking about this book for weeks. If you read it, let me know! I'd love to discuss it with someone!"
778,5.0,"Prior to reading the book I read one review that wasn’t altogether favorable, but I also read, Amor Towles previous books, “Rules of Civility” and “A Gentleman in Moscow”. After reading, “The Lincoln Highway” and rating it five star I don’t know which book I liked best, they are all great. The best recommendation I can give is that if you haven’t read all three book you have some enjoyable reading to look forward to. As for the other reviewer the person who thinks Billy is to wise beyond his years I recommend practicing a little humility.Amor Towles had the education to be a writer long before he published his first book. He then had a career and life that gave him the depth of experience to become the great writer he is. His books are rich in both prose and content. Many of you have read all three of his books, I would love to hear from you about what you enjoy reading. "
779,5.0,"Wow! I am happy to end my 2021 reading with this tale of 3 troubled young men, one brilliant boy and one woman who was tired of doing everything for everyone around and having no time for herself. The story flows slowly, picks up steam and ends with all the answers I needed, well maybe not all of them. This is a classic!"
780,4.0,"I liked this book but didn’t love it and I think that’s because I listened in chunks with big gaps of time. When I got towards the end I started appreciating it more as I could listen. Characters were well developed, I just didn’t love them like I loved the characters in Gentleman in Moscow. "
781,2.0,"Despite being named for a road, this is not a road-trip - it's a character-driven quest novel with an ensemble point-of-view. Contains more backstory than story, and didn't work for me.I liked the setting - 1954 America. Descriptions of most locations are evocative, and the characters are all quite distinct. Only a few really change over the course of this large novel.If you focus on the growth of one of those characters, the majority of the novel is superfluous at best, annoying at worst. Like many heist films, this was about interruptions to the plans - but not done as well in my opinion. One of the characters is told in the first-person, implying (in a way) that he is THE main character. Since he is also the most evil character, this makes for tougher reading. I had to put the book down with irritation at multiple points. When you factor in the length also, this is a novel which I found disappointing on my first read through.I absolutely loved A Gentleman in Moscow (Towles' sophomore effort), and plan to read his first book soon."
782,5.0,"This was definitely a huge read, but goodness I am so glad that I picked it up!! I felt like I knew each character and this story always had something happening. I loved loved loved this book! "
783,5.0,Listened via friends audibleI cannot tell you how well written this book is and the audio version is that much better. I so enjoyed this book and the story and the characters. I could vividly picture everything and I hope they make a movie out of it. The ONLY thing that bothered me was the ending. Thats it? But I am fine with it as well because this story could have gone on and on. There are so many little clever lines - Amor Towles must have put his heart and soul into the story of this book - you can almost feel it.
784,5.0,"Mr. Towles did a masterful job of telling this story of 4 young men all searching for their idea of the perfect life. I even loved all of the side characters, which is extremely rare. I'm not completely sure how I feel about the ending and really wish I had been reading this with someone, so I could discuss it right now. Anyway, I highly recommend grabbing a copy of this book!"
785,4.0,"An engaging amble. Although the page length is initially daunting, I was never bored while reading; the swift pacing moves the story along well, the interestingly complex characters are well-drawn, the book is niftily divided into the ten days that the primary tale spans, and the setting of a road trip on a classic highway is a fun way to explore multiple locations. Although not all of the perspectives are vital, it was enjoyable to get a glimpse into the heads of multiple characters, especially to better understand each of their motivations. While I've liked both of Towles' previous works, for some reason this one clicked a little more for me and I grew attached to several of the characters, rooting for them to somehow find a happy ending. I really appreciated how a particularly annoying, troublesome character gets a fitting ending in the final few pages.Thanks to NetGalley for providing me with an ARC of this title."
786,4.0,"Towles has such a way with words. And while I didn't love it as much as I loved A Gentleman from Moscow, I loved the adventure story of Emmett, Billy, Duchess, and Wooley. Everything in Towles books happens for a reason, making his prose not just entertaining but smart."
787,3.0,"3.5 starsAmor Towles fooled me into believing that we would be on a journey down the Lincoln Highway in search of a long-lost relative. Instead, we went on a journey to learn the stories of a group of lost boys. This is a character-driven story. I was immediately engaged and invested with the characters. My only nagging thought was that the characters all seemed to be either too wise or to have very sophisticated thoughts for their age and station in life. Duchess was not a very believable character to me. The book is well-written with pieces of writing that are so clever they made me smile. However, it’s a very long book that takes its time to unfold. I grew a little bored near the end and weary of the Professor Abernathy references. The view is constantly shifting from character to character which was not difficult to navigate but made the book longer than it needed to be. I found it interesting that Duchess was the only character that was told in the first person. I really wanted to know Sally more. There were a few chapters with her point of view but not enough to understand her motivations fully. The conclusion was a disappointment with Woolly and Duchess. Thank you to Goodreads and Viking for this ARC. I was a Goodreads giveaway winner."
788,5.0,"I am so sorry to say goodbye to these characters. Read it slowly, savoring each page of exquisite prose. "
789,5.0,"Loved this book. The compelling storyline, the depth of the characters, the amazing bond between brothers, the setting in the mid-1950s. All taking place over only 10 days. Towles is a magnificent storyteller, in my view."
790,4.0,"Oh, this was a joy! 4.5 stars. I know some will say it is a bit hokey and sentimental, but I loved that about it. The characters are fabulously drawn, and the friendship that develops between Billy and Woolly is beautiful. I woke up at 5:30 this morning, couldn’t fall back to sleep, and gave in and finished the last sixty pages. I’m sitting here smiling even as I’m a little teary. "
791,5.0,"Another completely different masterpiece. Confusing, endearing, lovely and terrible at times. A must. "
792,4.0,Delightful read. 4.25*
793,5.0,5+++ Amor Towles outdid himself this time! Highly recommended to my book worm friends!
794,5.0,"Ahhhh. Amor Towles' new novel is, for me, just as delightful, warm, human, witty, nostalgic, interesting, and wise as his other two. It felt like an old black & white film that follows along on the shared adventures of a motley crew like in the Wizard of Oz, each with their own back story and mission, with their particular strengths and weaknesses, and their unique life perspectives. From Sister Agnes' advice for ""serenity in your step"" to Wooly's ""heebie-jeebies"" about a thesaurus to just about any opinion out of Sally's mouth, every character and every chapter had me chuckling, sniffling, and wowed. Thank you, Mr. Towles, I needed that!"
795,3.0,The Lincoln Highway is a classic American road trip novel in which every single sentence is perfect. There are just way too many sentences.
796,4.0,"Like ""The Rules Of Civility"" and ""A Gentleman In Moscow,"" the newest novel from Amor Towles graciously invites you in like a comfortable chair, and secures you for a long, smooth ride.""The Lincoln Highway"" really doesn't share much with the other two books, except for a couple of clever family ties disguised as easter eggs, and that's for the best. I loved both of those books, and was pleased that this one was different.A story of travel, mostly by car and train, that weaves narration from each of the well-drawn interesting young characters, with a story that at times meanders, but never lost my interest. I liked each of the characters, which made switching narration fine. The one criticism? Towles' writing is so smooth and eloquent, some of the prose just didn't fit when spoken by some of the characters (especially a precocious 8-year old), but that's a minor ding.Taking place over ten days, ""Highway"" is the perfect book for a long plane ride (where I read most of it) or a relaxing vacation. It allows you to escape into the lives of others, without regret or jealousy, but with interest as to what will happen next."
797,3.0,Actual rating 3.5. About 200 pages too long.
798,4.0,"I just don’t know with this book. Ultimately it was well written and I wanted to know what all was going to happen, and so it gets four stars because of that. But it just wasn’t what I expected, and maybe that’s on me. I didn’t mind the changing perspectives, some of the characters were great!, but others were random and I didn’t get the point. I don’t think I got the point in general though - it was a road-trip, but not; the characters don’t really grow… I don’t know. Four stars because I am glad I read it, it just fell a bit flat for me, especially after Towles other two books. "
799,5.0,576 pages was intimidating for me- but it had great reviews! I thought the writing was impressive. I loved all the characters- their thoughts and actions-some good life lessons shared also. A very interesting road trip for sure!

801,3.0," Most readers of TLH came to it the same way, I'm sure; they read Rules of Civility and/or A Gentleman in Moscow, and figured a new book from the brilliant Mr. Towles must be just as good as his first two. Based on the reviews, it appears that many readers think so. My take: TLH has its charms, but it doesn't measure up. Here we have a group of late-teens (and one supernaturally-endowed younger brother) leaving home, embarking on a journey to a new life via the fabled Lincoln Highway; one theme is the endless restlessness of the strong, and their need to seek new adventures and a better life; a lesser one is the need not to judge others' apparently bad acts without giving due weight to the circumstances which caused them to act as they did. These are worthy topics, but the vehicle they ride here is much too insubstantial to carry them successfully. To me, at least, the characters were cartoonish; the situations and their resolutions were implausible, and the labored denouement to this overly long book left far too many loose ends to be satisfactory. I didn't understand these people or why they continually made the mistakes they did, and I guess it was ironic that with all that puzzlement along the way, still one never was in doubt about how things would turn out in the end. I have a vague feeling that I must have missed something here, because Towles is too good to have fallen as short as this looks, but for the life of me I can't think what it might be. My takeaway: This book could be entertaining YA; read it that way and enjoy it as such."
802,3.0,"Great writing, but about 250 pages too long. "
803,2.0,"As much as I loved Rules of Civility and A Gentleman from Moscow, The Lincoln Highway just fell short for me. The book follows a decent story, but really misses the ""it"" that makes you not want to put the book down. What I loved about the first two books was that the friendships that were developed were so well done that you really fall in love with the characters. Unfortunately this didn't happen for me in The Lincoln Highway. The other part of the the first two books was that they were written in a ""snobbery"" kind of language that Amor had mastered. This book is completely missing that form of writing. I know it is tough to compare against your previous books, but it is hard not to with The Lincoln Highway because the first two books were so good.The Lincoln Highway really features four main characters, Woody, Emmett, Billy and Duchess. The four young men travel across The Lincoln Highway in search of money that Woody has inherited with the intention of ultimately going to California to search for BIlly and Emmett's mom. There are other characters that come into the story, but it is really around the four main characters. As mentioned, for me, I just never really felt anything for any of the characters. I think the plan was for you to really connect with Duchess, but it just never really happens. The young men end up in a number of interesting situations and the book moves very slowly.The Lincoln Highway was just slow to read. It just wasn't as enjoyable to read as Towles' other books. I struggled through it the entire time and was actually happy to finish it, because it meant I could read something else. Sorry Amor. I just missed the uppity, snobbery writing of the previous books. "
804,5.0,"So much genuine sweetness and so much aching loss in this book. Everyone tries to be kind, or at least all the main characters in this book do, even Duchess, the character who always causes all the trouble for everyone around him.I loved this, but it made me feel anxious much of the time I read it. Emmett knew just what he wanted to do- and he could never do it. It was like one of those dreams in which you’re late getting to the airport, but you keep remembering things you absolutely need to pack, and then the car won’t start, and endless barriers are put in your way.Emmett is almost 18 when gets out of a Nebraska juvenile detention facility/work farm in 1952. There’s not much to return to. His mother ran off a long time ago- one of those aching losses- his father has just died, and the family farm has been lost to mortgages. But he has his 10-year-old brother Billy, a Studebaker, a little money, and some know-how around tools and building things. The plan is to head west. But then two of the other inmates at the juvenile detention facility show up. One of them is Woolly, a big child from a rich, WASPy family back east, and the other is Duchess, a chaos agent, a charmer, and one of the best characters I’ve ever found in a book. Everyone winds up going in the opposite direction they thought they would.This is a delight from the beginning. Towles is better and better at creating characters. The narration gets passed around between the characters I’ve already mentioned and also to Sally, the woman from the next farm over who has a tart, opinionated voice, and who has absotively had it with farm life, cooking and cleaning, and she winds up being part of this adventure too. It takes no time for you to know these characters and to care about them deeply, and there are tons of those unpredictable, charming conversations I love most when I’m reading.I loved this book more than Rules of Civility, which had some pacing problems, and A Gentleman in Moscow. One of the pleasures of the latter was its leisurely pace- but it could be too leisurely. Spoilers below.That ending was abrupt. Surely Emmett and Billy won’t just get to go to California with their hundred thousand dollars? The police will never want to clean up some loose ends by talking with him? Also- Emmett doesn’t know it, but he did kill another person- Duchess- as he swore he never would, although you could totally make a case for Duchess having killed himself. I can’t quite believe that Emmett, moral person as he was, would have just left Woolly to rot up in that bedroom, wouldn’t have insisted on going to the police.Billy was maybe a little too much? Always noticing everything, figuring everything out perfectly. But whatever- I can accept him. People are eccentric sometimes.As sad as I am about Duchess’s end, I think it follows the parameters of the world presented in this book. He bashed through the world brandishing frying pans like the goddamned angel of death- and he was just going to saunter out of this with a big pile of money? And this death was exactly what someone- Townsend?- had said about Duchess. He focuses in on one thing- the bills blowing off his great stack of them- and misses what’s in his peripheral vision: he can’t swim and if he moves, the boat will sink.And Woolly. How I loved Woolly’s wonderful day, FAO Schwarz, tea at the Plaza, the circus, the professor, the Empire State Building and the Brooklyn Bridge, pasta mon amore. Fuck you, “Dennis.” And poor sister Sarah!I’ll miss the world of this book. Thanks to Edelweiss for giving me an advanced reading copy in exchange for an honest review."
805,3.0,"Why do authors feel the need to forgo proper punctuation Is it pretension Is it laziness This book was compulsively readable but I was jolted out of the story numerous times by the lack of proper punctuationI scoffed when I read this passage I mean really When Wolly was a boy, punctuation had always struck him as something of an adversary-a hostile force that was committed to his defeat, whether through espionage, or by storming his beaches with overwhelming force. In seventh grade, when he had admitted this to the kind and patient Miss Penny, she explained that Wolly had it upside down. Punctuation, she said, was his ally, not his enemy. All those little marks-the period, the comma, the colon-were there to help him make people understand what he was trying to say.You forgot to mention quotation marks They are also there to help people understand what you are trying to say"
806,2.0,"I was willing to give this a 3-star rating for great writing until the ending. How do you cast the protagonist as a moral, heroic character who then acts totally out of character to be punitive? Was Emmett even a protagonist? The many characters shared the headlines, each had their own chapters sharing their stories. And was there even a plot? It was way too long, repetitious, ponderous and made me question how Towles has written two of my favorite books then rambled through these unconnected stories on a trip down The Lincoln Highway which never happened for Emmett and his brother and was never talked about by the two characters who were actually on The Lincoln Highway. "
807,3.0,"I started this book convinced that it was going to be a 5 star book after reading only a few pages. Then, when one bad thing after another kept coming up for Emmett and Billy, I put the book down thinking I can not deal with this book if it's going to keep going this way. However, I picked it back up and thought 4 stars (this was Amor Towles after all, author of the amazing The Gentleman in Moscow, and not-as-amazing-but-still-really-good Rules of Civility). The Lincoln Highway was headed to five stars, I was sure...and then came the ending. I won't be writing any plot spoilers. I'll just write: ""I don't think Billy would have approved of this ending."" Unlike a reviewer who did not like Billy, I thought Billy was the best part of this book. I liked Sally, also, and I do like that Towles changes things up. Towles puts in situations that you don't expect...except that I didn't expect the ending and that I didn't like. It's not that the ending isn't, perhaps, ""just""; however, I don't think it was the best for Emmett, another character I liked (I also liked Ulysses and the Professor). I felt sorry for Woolley and Duchess. Books with chapter headings for each character are not my favorite, but because Towles has phenomenal vocabulary and literary allusions, I'll forgive him (ha, not that he needs my forgiveness). It did irk me that ""white lies"" was used three times. I get that it totally fits the time period; however, I think some horrible phrases need to be dropped for the rest of eternity. I think I had expectations of traveling along the Lincoln Highway clear to San Francisco, and instead wound up blown off course much like Odysseus/ Ulysseus. To the reviewers who did not get the point of the book except perhaps a wandering, a meandering: that's fairly much an epic journey. For those wondering about ""triggers"" -- there are. Check out the reviews with plot spoilers. I liked the book (3 stars) just not as much as Rules of Civility (I think I gave it 4 stars) and definitely not as much as The Gentleman in Moscow (5 stars plus !!!). "

809,2.0,"What a disappointment! Having loved Rules of Civility and A Gentleman in Moscow, I was prepared to be awed by Towles' third novel. Instead I was beyond bored and a number of times ready to give up on the 576 page saga. But this is Amor Towles, I kept telling myself - I can't quit!An adventure/road trip extravaganza, the story is told through the eyes of several characters, the main ones being 18 year old Emmett, newly released from a reform school and his precocious 8 year old brother, Billy. Their father has recently died, their mother left them years ago, their farm has been repossessed, and as far as Emmett can figure, there is no reason for them to stay in Nebraska. He has grand plans to drive to California to carry out his idea to make his fortune by buying old houses, fixing them up and then flipping them. But before he can put his plan in action, trouble arrives in the form of two fellas he was in reform school with - the smooth tongued Duchess and the sweet, vulnerable Woolly. They need Emmett to help them with a scheme of their own - reclaim a fortune hidden in the Adirondack family home of Woolly's. And thus begins a tedious, long winded, torturous tale, full of back story, packed with numerous colorful characters, some dangerous, some kindly, some humorous, all with a tale to tell. And tell them, Towles does. On and on and on.I imagine I will be in the minority about this novel. But a book of this length should deliver more than just a great sense of relief upon finishing it."
810,5.0,"4.5 stars. My immediate response... Amor Towels is a gifted storyteller. This is a terrific novel, but doesn't have the extraordinary magic that made A Gentleman in Moscow a phenomenon. What it does have is a fantastic cast of characters, two of whom have a distant whiff of George and Lennie about them. Need to think on that more..."
811,1.0,"Audible version: I was really excited to get this book written by Amor Towles and narrated by Edoardo Ballerini, but what started out as a really great listen soon became so tiresome! I was put off by how immature Woolly was portrayed, by the cloying innocence of Billy, the dense, irritable yet weak Emmett, Sally's constant state of being miffed, and the incomprehensible meanness of Duchess. Also, Towles seemed to try too hard to be philosophical, or to conjure up wonder with really banal things like, ""Wow, did you ever notice how most of the question words start with W? Don't you think Ps and Ts feel bad?"" Okay, that isn't a direct quote, but it was eye rolling fodder and there's plenty more where that came from. I gave it 12 hours and that was way too much! It hasn't put me off either Towles or Ballerini, but I returned this one."
812,3.0,"Interesting start but I had a hard time caring about all the side characters and their stories and mischief and “wisdom”. I found it stressful to make it through the story.Strong writer and I can see snippets style from Gentleman in Moscow in the book, but I didn’t really enjoy this one, sadly."
813,1.0,"1.5 Ugh. I loved Rules of Civility and A Gentleman in Moscow, but this one just was not my cup of tea. I didn’t like the structure at all, Duchess and Billy both got on my nerves, and this was hardly a cross-country road trip book honestly. Very little on the road and mostly set in NY. This felt so repetitive and cyclical with a misfortune/setback occurring and then almost immediately something convenient to “fix” the issue. And repeat and repeat and repeat. The end wasn’t satisfying and this was about 200 pages too long. "
814,4.0,"I must start by saying I discover and loved Amor Towles Rules of Civility as an early proof copy, and same again with Gentleman in Moscow so couldn't be happier at getting a proof of The Lincoln Highway. The narrative is told from the viewpoint of multiple characters, with Emmett and his brother Billy at the novel's core. However there is a character called Duchess and I couldn't stand him, I struggled to read this character, I didn't want to spend time in his company. So that's why I'm rating it 4 stars as I can't love this book due to Duchess."
815,2.0,"A Gentleman in Moscow is one of my favorite books of all time, but this one fell flat for me. I didn't particularly like the quest to find Duchess and Wooly, and Billy, the 8-year old, was especially annoying, and seemed to be freakishly smart beyond what any 8-year old could know. This book was supposed to span a period of 10 days, but it felt like reading it took a year. I was very disappointed. I'm glad that so many other reviewers found this book to be to their taste."
816,5.0,"I'm updating my rating to ten stars! This charming story takes place in 1954 over ten days, though it feels like it's a lifetime as each character's background stories are revealed in the novel's process. Besides learning about the Lincoln Highway, which stretches from Times Square to San Francisco, a great deal of fascinating data is shared through the voice of the delightful 8-year old Billy Watson. I devoured the hefty 600-page book, though I wished I could have made it last longer...but I was too drawn in to not soak up every word. It's a treasure of a read."
817,5.0,"This book is big—in size, in scope, in story. And so enthralling. In the vein of his other books, The Lincoln Highway does not disappoint. Towles is a consummate story unwinder and this story unwinds beautifully with characters so distinct (as we experience the story through their eyes and experience) and so relatable. I traveled the Lincoln Highway with them in all its majesty, grandeur, and happenstance. It is a brief segment of lives richly drawn and eminently engaging. "
818,3.0,"Well gosh darn, I just didn't like this one as much as A Gentleman in Moscow or Rules of Civility. This is Amor Towles's attempt to do some Americana: There's a lot of Mark Twain here story-wise, but also some of the melancholy of F. Scott Fitzgerald.The thing I liked about Moscow and Civility was the density of the narration, and the way the novels alluded to many different contexts: history, literature, music, food, you name it. This one sticks to a relatively humble story of hitting the road, coupled with the consequences of crime (legal, psychological . . .). What could be more American than that? There's also an implicit critique of Emerson's version of individualism -- I think there's this deep subcurrent in the novel that's sort of like the ""there's no place like home"" theme in The Wizard of Oz. Anyhoo, hitting the road is a great American thread, and Towles tries to make it epic through the device of a book within a book, which is a boy's compendium of heroic stories -- the stories of Ulysses and Achilles are alluded to, and there's some good stuff there, but it doesn't quite gel.A real problem of the book (others will consider this a benefit) is that it's actually really hard to tell that the book is set in the 1950s. That might be deliberate to give the novel the feel of being about many eras in American history. But compared to the aggregation of period detail in his other novels, this one just feels like it's missing something. Indeed, the novel I kept thinking of while I was read this one was Paper Moon. There are a number of ""Depression"" motifs here: E.g., riding on boxcars . . . dude, yeah, but we're talking the 50s -- I don't think that works very well. Another funky bit is that after Civility, in particular, you'd think Towles would try to make his female characters more complex: But if you ask me, Sally in this novel is just a sassy midwesterner: It's not enough.In any case, this is an eminently readable story: It would be a good one to read aloud on a long road trip.[Added after the original quickie review:] For those of you who majored in American Literature or American Studies, there's an interesting quarrel to follow in this book between the plot and Emersonian ideals: Near the beginning you'll see that the protagonist is extremely skeptical of the way his father absorbed some lines from Emerson's Essays; and yet I don't think it would be a far stretch to claim that Emmett may be finding that his life is more on the Emerson trajectory than the Puritanical straight line.Last thing: Sequel potential? Yes, ma'am. As a movie, if the filmmakers can do good by the last couple of chapters here, it may be a winner, but there are a lot of ways for it to go wrong."
819,5.0,"If there’s anything we can learn from Amor Towles’ new nice, it’s that a great journey, when recounted as a story, must begin “in medias res.” Still, I hardly know where to start. I savored every episode in ""Lincoln Highway,"" knew right away that I didn't want to blow through it and miss a moment. This is the epic story of stoic 18-year-old Emmett, whose life has been a series of soft-pitch tragedies and a manslaughter charge that landed him in low security juvenile work farm, from which he has just been released upon the loss of his father to cancer. As Emmett returns to his family home resting in the heart of the Midwest, he discovers that his hapless failed-farmer father (who recently died of cancer) has left nothing to him or his 8-year-old brother, Billy, except debt. The two Watson brothers decide to head out west to find their mother, who fled the farm years ago, in San Francisco. Just as they develop their plan, two of Emmett's work farm friends, Duchess and Wooly, pop out of the woodwork (they've hitched a ride with the Warden back to Emmett's home and are AWOL) and foist themselves upon the Watson's plans. Herein begins a series of detours, hijinks, and adventures.At the heart of the journey (which ends up being a race to New York City, reminding me of those carnival rabbit races where one gets far ahead and the last-place sprinter seems to be doomed, but then pulls it off in the end) is precocious and hopeful Billy's prized possession: ""Professor Abernathy’s Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers, and Other Intrepid Travelers."" Billy is on his 26th reading of this book filled with the legends and feats of Odysseus, The Three Musketeers, and other famous heroes. This is Towles at his finest - setting us up with classic hero quest moments, and then layering in quirky, complicated characters along the way, each one contributing to the stories and the ""tools"" that little Billy collects as he builds his own epic story. It is, as Towles writes, like the flashlight Billy carries: ""A circle of light within a circle of light within a sea of darkness.""This, in and of itself, would be enough to fulfill my need for an earnestly good story. But Towles is a master writer, digging into seemingly bottomless stores of metaphors couched in classic philosophy and introspective musings, from Xeno's paradox to Schrodinger's Cat to the classic child's game of Telephone. Billy is a Huck Finn of sorts, naively taking on the world with hope and eagerness. With his stores of wisdom from his handy-dandy compendium, he quickly charms the lovely and loping Wooly, who has decided to rob his East Coast blue blood family's camp safe for his rightful inheritance of $150,000. Duchess, the most sinister and flawed of these musketeers, is all-in, and at any cost. Emmett, who must learn to control his reactive temper, is partly tempered by the literal girl next door, Sally, who is fiery and independent, and who proactively wraps herself in the tumbleweed of the boys’ adventures. Each character narrates the collective adventure - some in first-person, some in third-person limited omniscient. There is voice and heart in each story, and each story is layered with built-in cliff-hangers. Where one leaves off, the other backtracks, until the perspectives become shorter, more interwoven and inextricable. The last episode was brilliantly-constructed with a sort of tragic Greek myth - a Tantalus moment that somehow makes me think there may be another volume of this epic story of the Watson brothers lying wait in Towles' own compendium.Let’s hope so."
820,5.0,"There are a number of authors I'm obsessed with, mostly because they consistently entertain me. However, I can count on one hand how many leave me in AWE, to the point where I have to take a reading pause after I finish their book, just to meditate on it. Amor Towles is one such author. He is genius. His ability to create characters, chemistry, philosophical conversations, moral dilemmas, endearment, heartbreak...he makes worlds come alive. He has no MO...he exists in different countries, genders, ages, time periods. It is a thrilling day when he publishes a new book. In 1954, 18 year-old Emmett Watson returns home to Nebraska after a stint in juvie, a victim of very bad luck. His father has passed away, the farm is in bankruptcy, and his precocious 8 year-old brother Billy is in need of family. Billy wants to go in search of their long-lost mother in California, Emmett wants to use his skills at construction to flip houses in a booming economy, so they make plans to start anew. Road trip on the Lincoln Highway, destination San Francisco! Only fate has other ideas. Emmett's friends Duchess (slick grifter in training) and Wooly (a simple-minded, gentle rich kid) escape from juvie and turn up in Nebraska, intending on settling a few of Duchess's scores and absconding of some cash at Woolly's family cabin on the East Coast...with the help of an unwilling Emmett. So what starts out as a road trip story turns out to be a series of misadventures, taking Emmett and Billy in the opposite direction of their goal...New York City. The group gets separated again and again. Two steps forward, and three steps back. Emmett's car is stolen, homemade jam is bestowed upon orphans, a ride is hitched on a train car, run-ins with a thieving priest and a wandering black WWII veteran named Ulysses, a night in a cathouse, a life-changing visit with a reclusive author, and ultimately 10 days of hard lessons learned by young men coming of age trying to claw their way to adulthood.I did not want this book to end. It had nostalgia and heartbreak like Steinbeck, kids-on-an-adventure like Stephen King, and the genius of Towles. There were so many facets to the plot, so much going on, so many fascinating characters with complicated backstories, devastating outcomes...my head was spinning with questions and emotions. Which is as it should be!So I posted this on Facebook when I first started the audio...I actually made a noise (a squeal maybe?) when I learned that it was narrated by Edoardo Ballerini with support from Marin Ireland and Dion Graham. People, these are one of the best three voices in audiobook world. To have them all three at once is almost more than I could handle. That's all I can say about the narration."
821,5.0,"My journey with the Lincoln Highway took me over a month..If I was describing this in terms of food I would compare it to the richest most perfect desert which is so full of flavour and deliciousness that you do not want to rush one bit of it. The minute I finished this novel I wanted to go straight back in. I feel inadequate to do this justice. For me is was epic, a masterpiece. Emmett returns to his father’s farm and 8 year old brother, Billy. Their father has recently died. Billy wants the brothers to travel along the Lincoln Highway to find their Mother. Unbeknownst to them two other boys have escaped the work farm and hitched a ride and have other plans..There is so much to love about this novel. From the minute I started reading it felt immense, epic. It conjured up feelings I experienced when watching the incredible film, The Road to Perdition - and it felt incredible visual. The story features many road trips and there’s a wonderful sense of place - there’s even a map at the start at the beginning to guide you. Each destination has associations with hopes and dreams, past relationships, with making peace or settling scores and ties into the story of each of the boys and how they came to the work farm.There are so many incredible characters in this novel but my favourite is Billy. In fact I think Billy might just be my new favourite character ever. Short on years, he is nevertheless, a seam of deep and wonderful wisdom. This is the kind of wisdom which comes from an intuitive and logical perspective, often quite literal his observations are sometimes funny and always make you wonder why you had never thought of that before. This is such a big novel and it is worth every bit of the time you spend with it..I feel the story will live with me forever. With grateful thanks to Netgalley and Penguin Randomhouse for a digital copy of this wonderful book."
822,4.0,"This is the first book I’ve read by Amor Towles and I read it because it’s one of this month’s #mommaleighellensbookclub picks. It’s a beautifully written, character-driven story and I think you really need to know that last bit going in. This is not a fast-moving book at all and having the right expectations will make all the difference.This book is long, and at times, it feels like it meanders a bit, but I have to say that I completely fell in love with the characters and that is what made me stick with the story. They were so dynamic and flawed and even though this book only spans a period of ten days, these characters have such an extraordinary journey that they become quite unforgettable. There were times while reading this that I was reminded of William Kent Krueger’s This Tender Land, which I absolutely loved – the whole feeling of a band of misfits trying to get from one place to another.There are times this story deviates from it’s destination, much like the brother’s journey deviated from their original plan, but in the end, it is a story that winds its way into your heart so much so that you become attached to the characters. There are many poignant, funny and shocking moments along the way, and a few heartbreaking ones, too. But in the end, it is quite the original story and one that I’m glad I picked up.This is definitely a great book club pick as there is much to unpack and I’m looking forward to our discussion. I also plan on checking out this author’s other books because I have a feeling since I liked this one, I might enjoy the others, too. Audio thoughts: I ended up listening to this once I saw that Edoardo Ballerini was one of the narrators. He’s one of my favorites and between him, Marin Ireland and Dion Graham, I was captivated by this story. I think, because of the length, audio might be the way to go, at least it was for me, because it didn’t seem as long. Each of the narrators really did a fantastic job bringing this story to life and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to it. You can see all my reviews at: https://www.alwayswithabook.com/"
823,5.0,"The Lincoln Highway is an adventure-filled historical fiction focusing on a fresh start and the many ways it can be derailed. The journey spans half a continent but takes place over 10 days, following 18-year old Emmet Watson after his release from juvenile prison. His plan is to travel on the Lincoln Highway from Nebraska to California with his little brother Billy. But two stowaways, Duchess and Woolly, have a different idea and pull the Watson brothers in a whole new direction. Amor Towles’ writing is full of wisdom, but laced with humour and levity. It feels very heartfelt, thanks to the philosophical musings balance with connections between characters. Although this book is the tale of an adventure, it’s not overly fast-paced or thrilling. Towles takes his time in setting the scene and mindset of his characters. His literary fluency is stirring, make it easy for the reader to invest in this road trip of a lifetime. The book has multiple POVs, which gives you a well-rounded view of each personality. I love the way Towles introduces his characters, using their backstories to create distinctive plot points to then satisfy events as they develop. They’re well-crafted young characters, with flaws and misguided expectations but oddities that make them loveable. This is a book with a lot of heart. At the centre is brotherhood, hope, and redemption, as well as themes of race, class, and mental illness. The journey along the Lincoln Highway is one worth following just to experience Towles’ description of events and fetching dialogue. It’s a beautifully written story, well-articulated, and crafted with layers that’ll certainly pull you along for the ride."
824,5.0,"I can see why this book isn’t for everyone as it is very slow moving but oh how I loved it. Set in 1954 and over a period of 10 days, it follows the lives of a group of rag tag people as they plan to ride the Lincoln Highway from New York to California. Emmett Watson has been released from a juvenile work farm after serving a sentence for accidentally killing a teen. His mother is gone and his father has passed away. Due to his fathers inability to farm the land that had been in the family for generations, his farm was now owned by the Bank. Emmett plans to collects his 8 year old brother from the care of neighbours and head to California to start a new life. Unbeknownst to him 2 inmates have stowed away in the back of the car bringing him home. So begins this charming, warm, all encompass story of life in the 50s. As the 4 boys set out on a journey that takes them out of their way on more than one occasion, it’s the people they meet on the way and the interactions with each other that make this a good read. I really loved its slowness and the way it wrapped you up in an era long gone. Reminded me a bit of This Tender Land another book defined by its setting."
825,4.0,"Wow! This was close to 4.5 stars for me and I feel is perfect for people who enjoy character driven historical fiction. Having read (and slogged) through A Gentleman in Moscow, I was a little leery about choosing this for my BOTM. However, it sounded intriguing to me so I went for it. I am so glad I did. I enjoyed the multiple perspectives, the parts about a hero’s journey, and the setting in the book. It’s not particularly fast moving or action packed but the last 25% I think moves fairly rapidly. Great for historical fiction fans or people who just love literary works. If those two genres don’t appeal to you, I’m not sure this is the one for you. "
826,5.0,"5 stars for sure!! Amor Towles has written such a clever story. I was hooked from page one. The storyline is unique and the way it is told/written is absolute genius! The author did a superb job of creating the four main characters. Emmett is calm & reasonable, his younger brother Billy is smart & introspective, Woolly is such a sweet kid, and Duchess is a troubled youth that is mischievous & charming. With their father recently deceased, Emmett & Billy plan to head to California on the Lincoln Highway to look for their mother now that Emmett is home from reform school. But then Woolly & Duchess arrive, which ends up changing the course of all four lives. Towles takes the readers on quite a journey, both entertaining and touching. "
827,5.0,"Amor Towles is a master story teller. He brings together a disparate group of young men, all having lived a little too much life in their early years, and gets you hoping that they will figure it out. With several narrators, who, like us, are never entirely reliable, Towles helps us see multiple perspectives in a realistic way. Of course life is a little too complicated for a simple ending, but I ran through this nearly 600-page book because I couldn't stop to walk."
828,3.0,"I thought the writing was good and easy to keep up with what was going on in the story. Character development was pretty decent as well. You could see how each back story shaped the characters as they are today. I did not like Duchess. Even though I think his character was kind of meant to suck I still didn't really enjoy reading his parts of the book. I wanted more from Sally's story or for her to be cut all together. It fell flat and even given the time this book takes place she is just a typical woman doing woman things, adding no real value. Emmett and Billy's brotherhood was wonderful and I would have liked a lot more on that. Disappointed that the Lincoln Highway wasn't explored as much as expected considering its the title. Is it part of the book? Absolutely. Just not how I anticipated. Also, didn't love the ending. I was hoping for more closure with Emmett and Billy's original adventure plan and that wasn't given to my liking. And what about Ulysses's ending? Not a terrible book, but probably longer than it needed to be. *SPOILERS FOR ME TO REMEMBER LATER*Billy tells Ulysses about the great Ulysses story and then ends up feeling hope he can find his wife and son after 10 years. No conclusion there. Duchess dies at the end because Emmett puts him in a boat that he falls out of and can't swim. Emmett and Billy get their share of Woolly's inheritance. We don't find out if Emmett and Billy find there mom if they even make it to California. Not much travel down the Lincoln highway. Billy did get to meet the author of his favorite book. Woolly kills himself after he gets in trouble with his sister and ""Dennis""."
829,4.0,"In his previous novel, A Gentleman in Moscow, Amor Towles had great fun creating a hotel oasis for an aristocrat in Joseph Stalin’s Russia. This time his pattern is a mishmash of heroic legends based largely on Homer’s Odyssey, as four 1950s youths embark on their own quests.Two of them, Emmett and Billy Watson, are brothers, bent on traveling the Lincoln Highway from Nebraska to San Francisco in search of their mother. The other pair, Duchess and Woolly, are escapees from a reformatory, bent on claiming a stash of cash in the Adirondacks from Woolly’s wealthy family.All four get caught up in a madcap saga with echoes of Ulysses’ journey homeward from the Trojan War. Instead of a ship, we get a stolen car. The Cyclops becomes a vagrant preacher. Ulysses is a World War II veteran wandering the landscape in railroad boxcars.The characters are distinctive and delightful. Billy, a bright eight-year-old, carries with him a book of heroic tales which he shares with anyone who will listen. Duchess is the streetwise son of an itinerant Shakespearean actor. Woolly is a dysfunctional reject of several elite prep schools. Emmett, the most responsible member of the quartet, suffers constant buffeting from the winds of chance stirred up by his companions.An adventurous spirit pervades the novel, told in rotating viewpoints by the characters. Just when you think things are going to work out, a new snag emerges to send it in a new direction. The narration is clever and amusingly philosophical.Amor Towles possesses a staggeringly bright imagination and an unsurpassed talent for storytelling. A five-star rating would be automatic for this novel, had he not tarnished his work with sprinklings of foul language and profanity. Hence, I limit it to four stars."
830,4.0,"I’m at about 3.75 stars for this book. I love how Amor Towles writes. It’s such a pleasure to read his books. I had really high expectations for this one after loving “A Gentleman in Moscow”. This one started off promising, but as I progressed through the book I realized I would not end up loving it as I’d hoped. I grew tired of Duchess, and his ability to constantly derail Emmett’s plans. Eight year old Billy became irritatingly precocious (anyone else a little tired of the child characters acting like adults trope in novels?). I would have preferred more character development for Emmett and Sally instead. "
831,4.0,"This is my first novel by Amor Towles and I was absolutely blown away with how well he brings this world and these characters to life. While the story is on the slower side of things, the characters were really great to follow. While Emmett and Billy seemed to be our main focus, we get so many more POVs as their journey for the Lincoln Highway goes on. This added a really unique aspect to this book, but could sometimes be hard to follow. Overall, this novel showed the value of love, loss and friendship. While it was a bit slow for my taste, I found myself wanting to go back to these characters and thought this was a well written novel.3.5"
832,5.0,"Was this just a good yarn or was there a hidden meaning, or other topics and tropes? There were threads of imagery – maps, watches, money, cars. But there were also topics of evil versus good, redemption, hope, friendship and loyalty, greed, integrity.Many people on goodreads have mentioned a slump in the middle or just a petering out of interest. I’m not one of them. I loved every page, every adventure, every character.And who are the characters? Almost all male – Emmet and his brother Billy: two boys who lost their parents and their home and decide to drive to California to see if they can find their mother. Emmet – a good kid who accidentally killed a boy and served time; Billy – an 8 year old with more sense than many an adult. Dutchess and his sidekick Wooly – escapees from a juvenile detention facility that stoyaway in a warden’s car and meet up with Emmet and change the course of the drive and the adventure. Dutchess, a kid who grew up fast with a con artist father, and Wooly, a neuro-disabled kid who grew up in the lap of luxury make quite the pair. Pastor John – a quick talking, greedy man, and Ulysses – one of my favorite characters, who is self-punishing. This book has risen to the top of my favorite books of 2021. Beautifully written, engaging and unpredictable, sit back, grab a cup of tea or a glass of wine and enjoy the ride!"
834,5.0,"“As you set out on the way to Ithaca, hopeful that the road is a long one,filled with adventures, filled with discoveries.”“ From some point or another, Daughter of Zeus, tell us the tale.”-HomerThe Odyssey This book is the most entertaining I have ever read. I gave it Five Stars because I couldn’t give it more.Like other great stories it is “in medias res”- it starts in the midst of things and works it’s way backward and forward.You will be introduced to “ the Chains of Wrongdoing”, Fettuccine Mio Amore, Zeno’s Paradox,and suprisingly the Lincoln Highway.Unlike The Odyssey, this road trip lasts only ten days, but with Amor Towles behind the wheel and 576 pages in length I wish it was longer.This book could come with a label: WARNING: This story and these characters may ruin it for the next book you pick up.Thanks for the ride Amor Towles- you are great."
835,5.0,"[Rounding up from 4.5 stars]A delightful cross-country odyssey of a ragtag band of brothers in 1954. ‘Delightful’ may be a bit of a corny old-fashioned word, yet it seems an apt description. The writing is full of clever literary delights, and it often produced in me a feeling of delight. I listened to this one on Audible, and the narrators — actors, really — are fantastic. This explains why I may have been recently spotted walking my dogs or driving around town with such a silly damn-fool smile on my face.Towles was already on my Automatic Reads list since I loved ‘A Gentleman in Moscow’ and ‘Rules of Civility,’ and this one did not disappoint."
836,5.0,"I received this ARC from NetGalley.I loved this book. I had no idea what it would be like other than the blurb (""Emmett returns home to pick-up his little brother Billy, tie-up his late father's estate and get out of town for good. Since leaving the Kansas youth facility where he's served time, Emmett has wanted one thing: to give them both a fresh start - and that means heading out to the sparkling west.Young, precocious Billy has plans of his own - to get to San Francisco, where he believes their long-estranged mother is waiting for them. However, as soon as they've loaded Emmett's bright blue Studebaker with their few belongings, trouble arrives and brings its sidekick in the form of Duchess and Woolly, two runaways from the very facility Emmett just left behind him.Insatiable Duchess and his devoted, but slow companion Woolly soon wreck Billy's plan to get onto the open road, one well-intentioned blunder at a time. Each young man sees this journey as his chance to pursue his dreams, settle scores and find riches. And a simple journey quickly becomes a dazzling odyssey filled with obstacles, villains and ruses fit only for heroes to overcome.Bursting with life, charm and unforgettable characters, The Lincoln Highway is an extraordinary journey through 1950s America from a master storyteller."")and I was entranced and swept up in the story from the opening. It tells the story of Emmett and his brother, Billy, their neighbour Sally and Duchess and Woolly who Emmett met in the juvenile delinquent home in Salina. Their stories intersect and wind and we meet wonderful characters on the road. Each character, main and supporting, is an absolute peach and the story of how they never quite cross the Lincoln Highway is enchanting. You learn American history, are reminded of Greek myths and other epic adventurers. Beautifully written and plotted it's quite simply a perfect novel. I would recommend this to anyone who loves character driven stories and exquisite description. I loved my time in this book,"
837,5.0,"What a book! A tale of heroes and journeys, and a cast of supporting characters equal to “Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?” I hope Emmett and Billy get where they are going and that the drive is satisfying. The ending was both sad and hopeful. Now to read Mr Towles other books!"
838,5.0,"I very much enjoyed this novel. The stories are very different, but for those who enjoyed A Gentleman in Moscow, there are similarities; intriguing characters, a compelling story and a twist of an ending. Everett & Billy captivated me. I never look at the end of the book except in rare situations when I need to ensure that characters I have bonded with survive to the end. I don’t want to know particulars, just need to see their names. I won’t spoil the book by relating what I saw, but know that I was so engaged that I had to peek. "
839,2.0,"Can’t say I understand all the fuss.It’s a story. Multiple viewpoints but hardly anything to write home about or in this case to Nebraska, New York, or California."
840,4.0,"I would give this book a 4.5 if I could. It is a quick enjoyable read with many humorous shenanigans and equally as many humorous characters. It has much to share about life in the 1950’s and reminds us of some history that we all learned at one time and have most likely forgotten. It is about nothing much, but constantly reminds us of how much life and personality traits can interfere in best laid plans."
843,5.0,"Well, if that wasn’t just the most delightful read! Amor Towels is just the most wonderful author."
844,4.0,"So different from others by this author, yet it has the same kind of poetry and vivid characters. A very good read."
845,5.0,A hundred stars. Simply magnificent. 
846,5.0,"English teachers might label this book as picaresque, a bildungsroman, a hero's journey, a Jungian archetype, or a quest -- it's all of these, yes, but there's so much more. In the hands of Amor Towles, the story of Emmett Watson, Billy, Duchess, and Woolly is a heart-filling tale that evokes laughter and tears. I have a serious book hangover after listening to this story -- I highly recommend the audio version. Rarely do I buy the hard copy after listening to the audio version of a book, but this one goes on my top shelf...right next to A Gentleman in Moscow."
847,5.0,"This was definitely an enjoyable read, but not in the same league as ""A Gentleman in Moscow.""Towles gives the reader a colorful cast of characters that made this tome a very quick read."
848,4.0,"“Because to aspire, to fall in love, to stumble as we do and yet soldier on, at some level we must believe that what we are going through has never been experienced quite as we have experienced it.”Amor Towles takes on his version of the Great American Novel with attentiveness and earnestness and I loved every word. Set in the 1950’s, The Lincoln Highway chronicles a group of teens who are thrust together and embark on a cross country adventure. I felt a roller coaster of emotions as each character has highs and lows in their respective quests and predict the characters will become well-loved in literary circles. The time period is a perfect backdrop, setting up the juxtaposition of a simpler time and incredibly complicated choices. The articulate and often heartbreaking storytelling will surely be admired by fans of Mr. Towles’ previous novels. Especially for readers who enjoyed William Kent Krueger’s This Tender Land. Thank you NetGalley and Penguin/Viking for the opportunity to read a copy in exchange for my honest review."
849,4.0,"I liked the characters and the plot. It kept me engaged. But there was something missing. I didn't love the characters. Possible spoiler alert: After a while, I realized that every time it seemed like someone or something needed saving, it would somehow happen. "
850,5.0,"I really enjoyed this book. I was a little nervous that it would be a series of struggles, but it’s more of a fairy-tale. Like any fairy tale, there are still moments of tension and worry, but the characters are wonderfully drawn and I know I’ll keep thinking about them for a long time."
851,5.0,"Amor Towles is just so so good. Like his others, there's something old fashioned about this book (and I don't mean the time period). I really can't put my finger on what it is, but it's so unlike most contemporary fiction. "
852,4.0,"4.5 StarsOnce again Towles gives us top tier writing. In the vein of Steinbeck, this novel could be right at home with those great American tales of realism, heart, wit, and historical social awareness. The sympathy you feel for the wide cast of characters covers an amazing range, even while you root for some more than others. The journey builds and builds giving laughter and tears. It’s beautiful and complex while also being fundamentally simple; the aim to build a better life during a time ripe with growth both personally and generationally.I only knocked off half a star because I had a couple nitpicky things that I didn’t connect with as much as I hoped. And overall I wanted just that littlest bit more. But make no mistake, this is still one of the year’s best books."
854,5.0,This is storytelling at its best.
855,4.0,"Loved it—the story, the writing, the characters—but that ending though…"
856,4.0,Great adventure story.
857,2.0,This is so boring I’m giving up at 503 of 576 pages.
858,5.0,"This is a novel which somehow escaped the 19th century and emerged in the 21st. Or maybe it is a picaresque novel that somehow got tethered to a Greek myth. There is a lot in these 500 plus pages, arguably too much. But if Towles has over-egged the pudding, it is still a remarkable and entertaining piece of work. Themes of love and abandonment, the quest, the hero, reading, writing, magic, all jostle each other, generally in a very successful manner.The basic strand of the plot, set in 1954, concerns Emmett Watson and his brother Billy, who intend to set off for California to find their mother who left the family years ago. She travelled the Lincoln Highway west from Nebraska, and they intend to travel the same route. Their plans are exploded by two of Emmett’s fellow inmates from a youth offender facility, who want to go to New York to retrieve an inheritance which they offer to share with Emmett. At an early stage they abandon Emmett and Billy, and head off with Emmett’s Studebaker and his money. So the quest begins as Emmett must retrieve his car and his money. His is not the only quest: the other have theirs as well. How they intertwine is complex, and mostly very satisfying.I found this novel a trifle hard to get into, but once I got started, I couldn’t stop."
859,4.0,"Once again, Amor Towles has crafted a story that takes his reader to an unfamiliar time and place, and somehow makes it feel like home. The Lincoln Highway is filled with interesting characters, all of them flawed but still seeking to make a better life for themselves. The journey didn't end where I expected (nor where the characters expected either, in most cases) but it was a rollicking journey I'm happy to have experienced."
860,4.0,"This book was such a good time. Somehow, just like I felt like a gentleman in Moscow, I felt like I was on the Lincoln Highway in the 50s. During this 10 day journey, I felt like I had traveled to NYC from Nebraska with Emmitt and Billy and Woolley and Duchess in the Studebaker. This book is a classic in the making."
861,4.0,Amor Towles doesn’t disappoint.
862,3.0,"3.5I liked this story but didn't love it. Beautifully written as all this authors books are, the story kept going off in too many directions for me (yes I know its a road trip book) I liked the nostalgia and descriptions of places and people but the stories and characters never completely clicked with me. Every time I started getting involved with the story it would go in a different direction that would lose my interest again for a while. From the reviews Most people are loving this, it just wasn't my favorite type of novel."
863,5.0,"An engaging ,entertaining read !After his father's demise , Emmett is driven home by the Warden after 15 months in a juvenile detention work farm. He decides to leave Nebraska and drive to California with his younger brother Billy for a fresh start. Billy dreams of travelling the transcontinental Lincoln Highway as their mother had when she left them when they were younger. Old postcards sent in the course of her travels give Billy an idea of where she might be and he tries to convince his brother to follow the same route. The appearance of two of Emmett's friends Wolly and Duchess, who stowed away in the trunk of the Warden's car , results in a change of plans. Emmett and Billy end up having to travel to New York after Duchess 'borrows' Emmett's car leaving them stranded in Lewis, Nebraska after a visit to an orphanage where Duchess's father had left him for some years before coming to collect him again. Sally , a family friend of Emmett and Billy, eventually joins them in New York. Through multiple POVs Amor Towles takes us on a journey - not just on a road trip in the 1950s but on an exploration of these different characters , Emmett, Billy ,Woolly, Duchess and Sally - their stories and aspirations , their strengths and their flaws . The internal dialogue of each of these characters is extremely well written. The bond between Emmett and Billy is heartwarming. Emmett is a level headed young man who is trying to do his best for himself and his brother. His has learnt from his past mistakes and genuinely looks forward to a better future. Billy ,a child who seems wiser than his years with his big red book on heroes, is endearing in that he sees the best in everyone around him . He is a smart child, but unassuming and trusting(not quite discerning between an 'acquaintance' and a 'friend') and how his pespectives are broadened in the course of 10 days is beautifully laid out for the reader to see. Duchess, at times, is the street smart one who knows how to fend for himself but at times is as vulnerable as can be and whose take on balancing his rights and wrongs may seem foolhardy and cause friction but the author gives so much dimension to his character that even though you might not like him at times you still want him to get a happy ending.Woolly comes from a privileged background but is all heart .He is quiet and introspective but takes joy in sharing stories with Billy .He revels in the adventure and novel experiences with his friends . Sally is depicted as a wilful young woman and a true friend to Emmett and Billy . You feel so invested in these characters and the people they meet in the course of 10 days that till the very last page and beyond you wonder where their adventures will take them. With memorable characters and brilliant storytelling this book is hard to put down!"
864,5.0,"This is my favorite book of 2021. Amor Towles did not disappoint. I may like this book even more than A Gentleman in Moscow and I loved that one. This may be the new Great American Novel. Set in 1954 with characters of a bygone era, this story of two(mostly orphaned) brothers and two misfits touched my heart. I so wanted to buy Professor Abacus Abernathe's Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers and Intrepid Travels which sadly is a figment of My Towles imagination. The story of the adventures/travels/mishaps along the way and the rich characters they meet made the 576 pages of the hardcover copy I had fly by and I was so sad for it to finish. "
865,1.0,I just couldn’t get into it. Slow and boring.
866,3.0,"There is certainly much to appreciate about how well written this book it. With that being said, I just wasn't immersed in the story. The characters often frustrated me more than they reeled me into their world. Additionally, the story I thought was coming based on the opening- Emmett and Billy traveling to CA retracing their mother's stops on The Lincoln Highway- was not the story of the book, and that kind of disappointed me. "
867,3.0,"I can’t quite decide where Towles was going with “The Lincoln Highway.” Was he aiming for “Oh Brother Where Art Thou?” or is this a picaresque novel like “Huck Finn”? I loved lots of things about the book, like the Odyssey and other mythical allusions, but the lack of a central protagonist and thus the lack of focus made it a little meandering for my taste. Eight-year old Billy is a sweet, trusting soul, and I’d follow him on another journey. I can certainly understand Sally’s reluctance to turn him over to his somewhat irresponsible brother Emmett. Sally too was a great character—Towels has a way with strong women. America along the Lincoln Highway, the picture-postcard stops along the way, including a loving view of New York City, made this road trip worthwhile, but not as wonderful as Towels’ other two works."
868,4.0,"It seems this book is supposed to mimic old-time cinema in a winky-wink sort of way. So Emmett looks like Gary Cooper, but the fight scenes and the freight train riding seem less out of America's past and more out of Old Hollywood (plus the focus on cars and the various interesting settings for the action). The characters speak like actors reading a script (Billy's stilted 1950s child-actor speech, Duchess's over-the-top elaborations, Emmett's upstanding Midwestern version of masculinity). Throughout the book, I could see it as a black-and-white movie more than I could see it as a representation of real people making believable decisions or having realistic dialogues. And I won't be surprised if we see it as a movie one day influenced by movie history, taking that winky-wink to the obvious extreme. As a movie-as-book, The Lincoln Highway does well.Parts of this book I really like: the definitive voices of the characters, for example. I equally enjoyed reading from Duchess's perspective as I did Woolly's and Sally's. And it is the voices of the characters that shape them; we can see them even with only sparse physical descriptions. But what is with writers trying to incorporate every perspective of every peripheral character? For a lot of authors, it acts as a crutch, but in this book, these were just wholly unnecessary and distracting: Pastor Johns, Professor Abernathe's, for example. "
869,5.0,"Lincoln Highway This was an entertaining trip with a brilliant cast of travelers. It reminds me of Homer, Chaucer, Twain, Irving, Kesey, Atkinson, Tyler and Shields.Yes, that’s a long list , but I bet that you’ll feel the weight and the light of each these venerable authors along with hints to too many for me to type.You can start off picturing Tom Joad (shit, I forgot to mention Steinbeck) on his way home from time spent in jail . Anyway and every way, Emmet and his 8 year old brother begin their 1500 mile trip to California on the Lincoln Highway by going east not west. They are never alone. They are separated from Emmet’s car , his cash and each other , but never for long. Billy, the 8 year old is a font of knowledge and holds Emmet’s heart .Billy steals the hearts of long journeying Ulysses and the professor . Dutch and Woolley ,fellow prison mates of Emmet , also learn from and value Billy’s erudition.There is nothing new in this novel. It is as old as the Iliad. And I guess that it is as new as any Star Trek intergalactic book.The end is a new beginning and a sweet good bye.I wholeheartedly recommend The Lincoln Highway . You know where it’s going but it’s such an interesting ride with atmosphere, side trips and sidekicks."
870,3.0,"This book did not live up to my expectations. I don't want to stop anyone from reading it, but if you never read Amor Towles before, go for Rules of Civility "
871,3.0,At no point during this reading did I say to myself ‘this is a great book’. The writing is good but the story didn’t resonate with me. Of course it’s impossible to say how I would have liked it had I not already read Gentleman in Moscow. 
872,3.0,Maybe if I had not loved A Gentleman in Moscow so much I wouldn’t have been so disappointed with this book. It was beautifully written which is the only reason I gave it 3 stars. However it was a tedious read bloated with too much unnecessary information and almost 600 pages long. I truly missed the wonderful female characters of his last book as they were few and far between in this one. Too many characters were brought in and just left hanging and the ending made no sense to me. 
873,3.0,"The book started, for me, as a five star. While fiction, the plot and characters should be believable. I did not believe Duchess as a character. The book went downhill for me when everything got too impossible: the circus, the women after, finding Billy’s author at work in his office. I wanted to love it but it did not hold my attention. "
875,3.0,"Thanks to Penguin Random House for giving me a copy to review via NetGalley.Amor Towles' second book, A Gentleman in Moscow, was thrust upon me at my book club. It was not a book that I would have picked up on my own, but I loved it. One of my most enjoyable reads in recent yearsSo I was more than intrigued by The Lincoln Highway , his third book.Once again Mr Towles presents us with a rich cast of characters, each whose thought processes and motivations are well explored. The narrative is told from the perspectives of several parties. I was a bit taken aback when Emmett's narrative changed to another character. It kicked me out of the moment as the style of writing was distinctly different. While it reflects the skills of the author, I liked these characters to varying degrees and this did impact of my enjoyment of the book.While sold as a road trip, The Lincoln Highway, is more about the people than the places as the road trip never takes place. Often the book seemed to rattle about with moments that added little to the story. These asides made the book long winded in places and did not draw me back to it.Overall, I did enjoy the book. It was clever rather than a notable book for me. Mr Towles is a skilled wordsmith and I await with interest what else he will create."
876,3.0,"I am so uncertain about my rating for this one... I must admit that I am really torn! And it's because of my love and admiration for the author and his craft. Amor Towles is such a masterful storyteller and his writing is utter perfection, but the plot was ultimately a little unbalanced, at least for me, and lagged in the middle portion of the novel. Plus, I found a few of the narrators and POVs to be really unenjoyable and characters I didn't want to root for. While, ultimately, I continued to keep flipping pages, I did have to step away from it for a few days and started another book in that time, so yeah, not the most absorbing work. Additionally, this novel does have a trigger warning for something I really dislike in books, but again, a personal thing for me and one that I was unaware of when I began reading. As far as a star rating, I am probably sitting at a 3.25-3.5... COMPLETELY still worth your time and the investment, but ultimately, didn't soar quite like Gentleman in Moscow did for me. I absolutely adored that one and still carry Count Rostov close to my heart as a fantastic literary hero! Still need to read Rules of Civility. It's on the shelf and sure to be on the TBR this fall & winter."
877,5.0,"5 on the typical GoodReads scale, maybe 4.5 on the AmorTowles Personal Scale. Like his two previous novels, it engages right from the get-go. So much great stuff here: the arcing story told from varying perspectives/characters; the many backstories/side stories that develop all the characters; intertwining thoughts about life and choices, elements of literature and the Great Hero stories, history and setting of the time period. I felt a wobble in my suspended disbelief a little at around page 420 for a short stretch. But that says something, no? Just the fact that I whipped through this 575-page book in just a few days is telling, and if it was me or the story that hesitated there -- who can say? This is another great book, one that will surely come to mind again and again over the years much as Gentleman In Moscow does. "
878,3.0,"I suspect this book is a lot like the highway, quite wonderful in places, but also very dull at times. Eventually one just wants to reach their destination. It's a shame, as I enjoyed the first half so much, but I grew tired of it as it was just too wordy, too repetitive, and too long. I wish the editor would have edited more. Where's Max Perkins when you need him?"
879,2.0,"As I slogged (and eventually skimmed) my way through the first 209 pages of this tale, I kept telling myself it was going to get better because, after all, Amor Towles is the author. How bad can it be? Well, bad enough for me to abort the mission on page 209, in the middle of some fake pastor bestowing words of wisdom upon little Billy. Or, more likely, Billy is going to enlighten the pastor because Billy is wise beyond his years and seems to know more about the ways of the world than any of the older characters. I think this story had a ton of potential, and Towles certainly knows how to write a good book (I really enjoyed Rules of Civility), but this one meandered far more than the Lincoln Highway does. With some major editing, quotation marks to indicate when characters are speaking, and with perhaps more likeable characters, I probably would have enjoyed it. But as it is? Not horrible, just… meh. I can’t bear to think of slogging through 360 more pages. The fact that I set it down for two days in order to read another novel stopped any doubts I had about quitting."
880,2.0,"I prefer the use of quotation marks for dialogue (the author uses the em dash), and was confused by instances of ""I"" (the multiple narration shifts between third- and first-person). For these reasons, the audiobook might make for a better reading experience.I didn't care to switch from the ebook, though, because I'm not big on adventure stories into which this one—that starts out like We Begin at the End (there's even a main character named Duchess in it)—evolves. (Never mind that the train scene was more Tom Cruise than Tom Sawyer, of which other parts reminded me.)Even the tie-ins to RULES OF CIVILITY (which I loved!) couldn't entice me to plow (npi) through the rest of the tangentially drawn-out, draggy story. I quit at Six."
881,2.0,"Oof. I’m giving up on page 451. This meandering story is just not for me, I know I am in the minority as everyone I know loves Towles, but I just don’t get the hype. Boring and just soooooo long. "
882,5.0,"Having read both of Amor Towels’ previous books I had high hopes for this one and it didn’t disappoint. Many readers come to Towles during the pandemic - the story of a Russian count being kept under house arrest in a Moscow hotel resonated with most of us during those long days of lockdown. The humanity and richness that was to be found in ‘A Gentleman in Moscow’ runs through every page of ‘The Lincoln Highway’ and I genuinely believed in every character.Released from juvenile detention following the death of his father, Emmett is left without a home after the bank forecloses on the many loans taken out against the family farm. Having been deserted by their mother years before, Emmett’s younger brother Billy and a bright blue Studebaker are the only things left in his world. When Billy reveals a series of postcards that he believes will lead them to their mother in San Francisco so begins a road trip through 1950’s America packed with a cast of sometimes flawed, sometimes loveable, and always interesting, characters.Running parallel to Emmett and Billy’s story is that of Duchess and Woolly - escapees from Emmett’s detention centre who have their own reasons for wanting to join the brothers on their cross-country journey. With each chapter written from the point of view of a different character the book really allows you to understand their motivations and why they’ve ended up where they are. There’s a real heart to this book, and the author does a wonderful job of building connections between the reader and each of the characters. You might not always agree with their behaviour, but they feel so much like real people that you’re somehow invested in them and want to see them walk along the path to redemption.I imagine the lockdown success of ‘A Gentleman in Moscow’ will bring a lot more readers to this book on release, which can only be a good thing. It’s a great story, and one that I would thoroughly recommend. Thank you to NetGalley and Penguin Random House for an ARC in exchange for an honest review."
883,4.0,"The Lincoln Highway is a wonderful multilayered novel. Towles weaves the concept of travel and discovery of both self and of place within a wonderfully diverse cast of characters. Layered within the story’s plot we have a book of heroes that serves as both a spine for the story and a place where an innocent 8 year old boy learns that hero’s do exist in every shape, form, and colour. There is a cast array of characters who weave through this novel. Perhaps too many characters. At times, I found the book wandered from it path and took too many detours. That said, perhaps that was Towles’s intent. The cliche life is an adventure, not a destination fits well within the complexities of the plot.Think of all the grand stories of adventure in American Literature. Huck Finn, Travels With Charlie, Nomadland, and on and on. Now add The Lincoln Highway to the list."
884,2.0,Excellent writing I just didnt like the story
885,3.0,"Some lovely writing, but I felt like this book wanted to be too many things and was not enough of any one thing. "
886,5.0,"I was so happy when i saw Amor Towles last book in the window at the Barnes & Noble on 45 St and 5th Avenue. Only 3 streets away from the beginning of the Lincoln Highway!! As I was getting ready to cross the country -much as the Lincoln Highway-, I got the book right before jumping on a cab to JFK. I read the entire flight to California and then kept reading enchanted, engaged, giddy. I loved Towles previous novels and I loved this one. I have been reading a lot of long novels this year, and many just felt too long, this one at almost 600 pg felt a bit short. I see so many great influences in the novel! Salinger and Fitzgerald most salient, also reminiscent of Kavalier and Clay. But this is also an Odyssey and the pursuit of the American Dream. Above all, the novel moves because of its characters, they are believable and lovable. Perhaps with the exception of Sally. I have already wagered a dinner that this will get the Pulitzer, I hope I’m right!!!"
887,3.0,"A huge fan of The Rules of Civility and A Gentleman in Moscow, it pains me to say this novel was an utter disappointment on all fronts. "
888,4.0,"I will admit that I was initially put off by this book because it deviates so significantly from Rules of Civility and A Gentleman in Moscow. I wanted more of the style and content I've come to know and love with Towles' writing. After a week of being annoyed and a bit pissed off, I put on my big girl pants and restarted The Lincoln Highway.What Towles delivers is an epic adventure of three almost adult men and an eight year old boy. Young Billy quickly steals the limelight and will delight readers with his quick wit and gentle observations. His ever present big red book offers myth, history and insight. The shenanigans of Woolly and the Duchess kept me at the edge of my seat while Emmett's steadfast focus on California tried to ever push the escapade westward. The multiple literary and historical references throughout the novel gave me a summer's worth reading list. Overall, a very endearing read."
889,2.0,"One thing after another, and then the same things over and over. "
890,2.0,So very disappointed not what I was expecting and struggling to finish some scenes remined me of all the Netflix movies I ve seen recently of people running on top of trains.The book went off suddenly in a direction and I am a huge fan of TowlesDNF !
891,5.0,"This one is going to stay with me for a while. Emmett is released from juvenile detention after his father's death. He returns to the farm that his father never managed to make profitable to pick up his car and his younger brother, Billy, and head out west for a fresh start. Billy insists that they travel the Lincoln Highway in search of their mother, who left several years before along the same route. Unfortunately, before they can leave, two of Emmett's bunkmates from the detention facility, Duchess and Woolly, show up. They were stowaways in the warden's car that delivered Emmett and they want him to drive them from Nebraska to the Adirondacks to Woolly's family camp to retrieve the inheritance his grandfather left to him in the safe there. Emmett has no intention of doing this until Duchess steals his car and Emmett & Billy have no choice but to follow them. Duchess is clearly the brains of the operation and Woolly is on special ""medicine"" that mellows him out. I have no idea what this medicine is but Woolly behaves like someone who may have a mental illness or learning disability. Since Duchess took the car with Emmett's bag in it, Emmett & Billy have no money for the journey to New York so they hop a freight train. Here they run into some savory (Ulysses) and unsavory (Pastor John) characters. Billy befriends Ulysses and reads him the story of his namesake from a large book of adventures of world travelers. Ulysses is so moved that he protects Billy from Pastor John and helps him & Emmett get to NYC. Once in NYC, Emmett sets out to find Duchess and Woolly by tracking down Duchess' father, which is the reason that they came to NYC so that Duchess could clear up some unfinished business with his father. His father, a washed up stage performer, is the reason that Duchess was in the detention facility. Duchess is big on settling up his debts as they travel along, which includes dishing out punishment to those who wronged him, such as beating the guard from the detention facility, and repaying debts, such as giving Emmett's car to a former bunkmate in Harlem who didn't rat Duchess out when they were both at the detention facility. Meanwhile, gullible Woolly wants to go to visit his sister. Duchess agrees as it will keep him out of his hair as he tries to settle up business while staying one step ahead of Emmett. Each time Emmett tracks Duchess down, Duchess slips his grasp. Duchess was infuriating. He was extremely selfish and while on the surface he seemed to have good intentions and believed that was acting to the benefit his friends, his decisions and actions were usually wholly for his own benefit and were usually poor ones at that. Eventually Emmett gets his car back but also learns that the cops are on Duchess' trail and, since they know that he was driving Emmett's car, they are searching for Emmett too. So, instead of heading west, he & Billy follow Duchess & Woolly up to the camp in the Adirondacks to force Duchess to go to the police and clear Emmett's name. But when they get there, Woolly has killed himself by taking an overdose of his ""medicine"" and Duchess is still hammering away on the safe. Emmett is furious that Duchess is so uncaring that he left Woolly in that state without calling the police and Duchess doesn't see the point as they can't help him now anyway so they should just take the money and go. Emmett won't hear of it and decides that it is beyond time for Duchess to take responsibility for his actions but Duchess breaks into the gun cabinet and threatens to shoot Emmett and Billy if they don't let him continue to work on the safe. Emmett knows that the gun is unloaded and so he takes the gun, knocks Duchess out and plans to leave with Billy but then they see the note from Woolly telling them that he is leaving them each a third of his inheritance from the safe and the other third to Duchess. Billy says that he figured out the combination of the safe so they open it, take their share and leave Duchess his but since they want to put the house back in order to cover their tracks, they put Duchess on a boat in the lake with his money, giving them time to clean up and get away before he regains consciousness and makes it back to shore. Unfortunately for Duchess, he gets what is coming to him when he falls out of the boat and drowns while Emmett & Billy are finally making their way out west along the Lincoln Highway. I loved this coming of age tale. The innocence of Billy and Woolly counterbalanced by the reformed Emmett, determined to make things right for his brother, and the unreformed Duchess who is set on settling scores and getting what he believes is his due. Highly recommend. "
892,4.0,"Determining a star rating for this book was really hard for me. It tells a powerful tale while sending a profound message as well. In a book abounding with symbolism, it seems to be about innocence seeking wisdom through experience, for how else do human beings learn?Out of a host of narrators, namely, Emmett, Duchess, and Woolly, (three former inmates of a juvenile ""work farm"") I finally realized at about page 400, that this wasn't really their story; it is the story of Emmett's little brother, Billy. Which is why the author chose to preface the work with a poem from O PIONEERS!, by Willa Cather, whose last line reads: ""Against all this, Youth...""It is above all, a poignant story that even at its most hopeful, has an edge of grief that can never be fully assuaged. One of the most brilliant things about Amor Towles is his ability to write about entirely different subjects in different circumstances and settings. The only commonality shared by A GENTLEMAN IN MOSCOW & THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY, is stylistically, where certain characters resort to pomposity of language. I must add that Towles's first novel, RULES OF CIVILITY, is almost completely unlike his two follow-ups, except in overall excellence!Now for the reasons that choosing a rating was so difficult: there are several serious flaws in this book that kept it out of the five-star range and made even a whole-hearted four-star rating debatable. First and foremost, it was overlong, even though it was a pacey, quick read, it was definitely hampered by verbosity and some redundancy. Secondly, no juvenile, first-time offenders would have been ordered into another state's correctional facility! All three detainees were sent to a work camp in Kansas, but Emmett was from Nebraska and Duchess and Woolly were both from New York. However, those were not even the most glaring problems. No, what I could not get over was the saddling of 18 year-old boys with the world-weary attitudes of jaded 50 year-olds! Where was the chip-on-the-shoulder, bitter belligerence that is the hallmark of ill-done-by adolescents? These three paragons were more than willing to accept responsibility for their so-called crimes with a strict code of ethics, even if it was their own brand! If they were going to think and act so maturely, then they needed to be portrayed as at least a decade older in order to be even slightly creditable.And finally, I think most people, given today's climate of ultra-sensitivity to gender issues, may find it offensive to be so thoroughly male-driven, although this is NOT a concern for me since I enjoy ""buddy"" books and found this to be delightfully reminiscent of both Steinbeck and Doig, who write so compellingly of masculine friendships, especially between different ages and intellects.So after pondering all these elements, I decided to come down in favor of what I think the book was trying to say and for the desire it gave me to ponder and reflect on the human condition."
893,5.0,"This book is clearly among the best fiction ones that I’ve read! I was almost tempted to skip this review because I’m sure it cannot do justice to the beauty of this book.It covers ten days of a road trip undertaken by four boys — Emmett Watson, Billy Watson, Daniel (Duchess) Hewitt and Wallace (Woolly) Walcott — from Nebraska to New York along the Lincoln Highway. The Watson brother eventually want to end in California on the same highway in search of a new life and a mother who abandoned them. The other two are heading out to retrieve Woolly’s inheritance in New York. Emmett is the serious one with a high sense of integrity but is doomed to cause unintended adverse consequences by his actions. Billy is young, precocious, filled with wonder at each of life’s experiences and mature beyond his eight years. Duchess “loves it when life pulls a rabbit out of a hat” as he puts it. His sense of morality varies as per his convenience but a fractured relationship with his father eventually spirals it downwards . Woolly is a free-spirited but a lost soul, addicted to some form of drugs but possibly the most perceptive of the four. Each character is etched so beautifully that you can’t but help root for them, even for the grey Duchess. For me, my favourite was Woolly!One of the best features of Towles’ writing is his ability to flesh out even the minor characters and have them play an important part in taking the story forward. We saw this in Towles’ previous book, A Gentleman in Moscow, and this book has even more minor players, complex and nuanced, scattered around the book. For me, one of the best passages in the book was the interaction between Ulysses, a vagabond in search of his family, and Professor Abernathe, the author of a book of adventures that Billy has read 25 times, despite both of them playing fairly minor roles in the book.Like in his previous book, Towles’ writing is excellent — it’s easy to read but at the same time etches each actor’s thoughts beautifully. And to enable this, he’s chosen a structure where the narration alternates among the points of view of the various characters. He has also numbered his sections in reverse order (one section for each day) to give us a sense of countdown towards the inexorable determination of each of the boy’s futures. The only downside to his writing is perhaps the unnaturally high level of sophistication that he awards to the actors — which eight-year boy (Billy) thinks so maturely or which young adult (Duchess) is able to do the things he does given his messed-up upbringing! It almost makes the reader feel inadequate!!Fun fact: The Lincoln Highway ends around the same date as A Gentleman in Moscow (summer of 1954 with June 21 playing an important role)Pros: Superbly written, brilliant characters, an enjoyable re-readCons: Overly sophisticated characters perhapsPS: Please visit http://ananthabookreviews.blogspot.com for other book reviews"
894,4.0,"Well...what can I say about this book? First of all, I love Amor Towles's previous books. I adored A Gentleman in Moscow...raved about it to my friends and immediately read Rules of Civility which just pulled me deeper into Amor Towles's magic. Oh my, can this man write! I preordered The Lincoln Highway, but this time I ordered it on Audible instead of in print. Maybe that was my mistake... I do not know, but I have to say I was disappointed in this long awaited book. I gave it four stars, but it is really three and a half as I could not give Mr. Towles a three star rating. This book was long. Now, I have read other long books where the words and time flew...this book was not one of them. There were many characters....four main ones, many secondary ones...all, every one, had their own stories which were told in detail and intertwined in the the plot. Again, I am listening, not reading, so this may have made a difference...but I found myself getting confused and frustrated at the way the author would cut off the action of another character's story and go immediately into the story of another. It was easier to follow than The Stand, which drove me crazy, but as Lincoln Highway did not drive me crazy, it did frustrate me. There was a lot of information given in the stories. I have to say, that the author did make the characters come alive, and I wanted to see how they all turned out and how the story ends. BUT..I did not like the ending...which is ok, because it was a the author's ending and I will not give it away, but the ending left me with a ""What?? Is this all there is? ""..which can be good but in some cases this one made me sad. This was not a sad book...it was a testament to life and and how to find the silver lining etc...but the ending did not follow this line of thought. I would like to hear other opinions on the ending. Would I recommend this book? I would with a caveat...I did listen to it instead of reading it. The oral rendition left me frustrated at times, but I still liked the book, did not give up on it, and wanted to see how it ends. The characters were vivid and alive...I loved them all...but...there is that but. :-) What did you think? "
895,5.0,"Mesmerizing. Addictive. Spellbinding. Delightful. But more than any of those ——-an antidote for the claustrophobic ! Yes! For those eleven people who found a novel about a Russian count who spends forty years in the Hôtel Metropole to be completely stultifying , your cure is within the covers of this treasure chest of heroes, quests, journeys, escapades, and most remarkably, detours, diversions and digressions that could be impeccably crafted, fully perfect short stories in themselves. For the rest of this, this is simply joy between two cardboard covers, wrapped in a perfect cover . Amor Towles has a now well-documented, and seemingly insatiable, curiosity for life that allows him to weave into his plots the most incredibly disparate digressions which, in the hands of any other storyteller, could be annoyances, but, in his, become veritable cabinets of wonder. For me, this charming tendency of Amor Towles’s draws me ever closer to the memory of his charming father Stokley, whose boyish zest for life endeared him to every person who was fortunate enough to know him. In each of Towles’s novels, a love of history, a piquant curiosity, full helpings of joie de vivre, buckets of kindness, suitcases of fairness, and abundant respect for literary and moral heroes are apparent, and never so much as they are in The Lincoln Highway. A scholar in a seersucker suit named Professor Abacus Abernathe, a tall and gentle rider of the rails named Ulysses, and a nine-year-old boy names Billy Watson are the scene stealers of this fast-paced, endearing, morality tale, and their one scene together will absolutely steal your heart. THIS WOULD BE A FANTASTIC BOOK TO READ ALOUD TO ALL THE GENERATIONS OF A FAMILY, FROM GREAT-GRANDFATHER TO YOUR OWN VERSION OF BILLY—AND YOU DON’T NECESSARILY NEED A SPRAWLING ANCESTRAL HOME IN THE ADIRONDACKS AT WHICH TO DO SO…..ALTHOUGH THAT LONG PORCH WITH ITS GAGGLE OF ROCKING CHAIRS WOULD BE PRETTY PERFECT!"
896,4.0,"I picked up this two-inch cinderblock with the skepticism every reader should bring any novel longer than 300 pages. Indeed, Amor Towles seems to have reached that level of literary success that signifies his editor just has to show up for the check, rather than the work. Despite the length, however, this tidy story of foundering young men is offered in digestible morsels and spans a mere ten days’ worth of events. So it’s an easy, enjoyable read, even if a tad longer than necessary. The book centers around four young men, two of them brothers, three of them recently departed from a prison work camp (two of them illegally so), all of them eager for a new life out west if only necessity and the fates didn’t keep forcing their hand and pushing them in the exact opposite direction before they can make their start. Taking place over a week and a half in 1954, this book is a Coen Brothers movie/limited series waiting to happen, mixing elements of O Brother Where Art Thou and its picaresque journey through Homeric references with No Country For Old Men, in which a stash of money pushes the characters to the bleakest edges of humanity. Although more like O Brother in tone, there are moments of No Country's darkness in The Lincoln Highway, which becomes something of a page-turner as the characters’ fears, motivations and troubled histories converge toward the promised salvation of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars. But each time he approaches that precipice, Towles gently brings his tale back from the edge as Emmett, Billy, Duchess and Woolley experience forgiveness, understanding self-acceptance, wonder, and the kind of good luck available only to those with nothing to lose. We get the story from each of their perspectives and a few more besides that fatten up the novel more than the plot needed them to, but Towles’ writing is engaging and full of details that feel like treasures. Each person, each backstory is just juicy enough to seem essential. Though the book is primarily concerned with character and what makes a hero’s journey, the plot hurdles toward a confrontation that can really only end one way. The conclusion feels inevitable once it arrives and doesn’t quite hit the perfect alchemy of surprise and satisfaction that I found in the final moments of his last book, A Gentleman in Moscow. Still, the author's gift is making you care for his characters, and that gift as sharp and entertaining here as in any of his previous work. "
897,5.0,"If you're expecting another Gentleman in Moscow, think again. I was expecting exactly that, and I wound up thoroughly disliking the first quarter of this book, because I was misreading it. When I finally figured out what was going on, I went along for the wonderful ride it is. I had expected a somewhat sentimental, but completely realistic novel, and the set-up implies that that is exactly what I was going to get. But what I got was one in which what happens is the opposite of what is expected, characters appear out of nowhere, and a Black man in 1954 who has been riding in boxcars for nearly a decade can say, ""I should think I would know."" All the characters sounded pretty much like that, but after multiple allusions to classical epics and romances like The Count of Monte Cristo, I realized that Towles was going for that kind of diction, partly seriously, partly sending it up. There are mythical characters here, Duchess (a young man) reminding me of Ariel and Caliban rolled into one. Abacus Abernethe is almost another Dumbledore. The eight-year-old Billy, who is almost preternaturally smart, decides to write the tale of his own adventures, and realizing that he needs to begin in medias res as is always done in tales like this, discovers how hard it is to figure out what is the middle. Finally he decides on the exact point at which this book started. The New York Times review called this book ""mischievous,"" and that is exactly right. Nothing happens the way you expect. Stories are intertwined, digressions become main threads, secondary characters become major and then fade away, goals are striven for and almost never attained, what I took for a small realistic detail on page 15 paid off humorously in a chapter-ending cliff-hanger on page 459. My only complaint is that I wish there had been more of the indomitable Sally in this book which otherwise has very few women."
898,5.0,"Ok, so this is almost 600 pages which sort of feels like a vanity novel after the (well deserved) success of A Gentleman in Moscow. Where is the editor? Who has time to read a book this long? About 150 pages in, Towles spins a side character's back story out by 30 or so pages. And at first it seemed so unnecessary, like an author so in love with their own writing that I almost DNF at that exact spot. BUT! The way that side character's aside comes around really is pure storytelling genius. Turns out I finished the book in 3 or 4 days. I'm not going to go into details about the plot, but this is one of the best road trip stories I've ever read and I LOVE road trip stories what with the literal and metaphorical journeys. And the four main characters are all on wildly different journeys but how they intersect and interplay with each other was delightful. Where A Gentleman in Moscow focused on the characterization, this does a better job at storytelling. The fates of the characters becomes paramount over the actual characterization and I'm not mad. This is also one of the better literary examples of Chekov's gun. I was waiting and waiting for it to come around and when it did I audibly gasped. The page count alone will be enough to turn off readers, but I would easily suggest this to historical fiction readers especially those looking to take a break from the WWII time period. "
899,3.0,"I was so disappointed and downright annoyed by this book. I suppose my expectations were too high, following Towles' previous masterpiece, The Gentleman in Moscow, which I dearly loved. As usual, I've found other GR reviews that are much better than anything I could write -- I recommend  this one by Yun,  with which I totally agree. I would only add a few things: First, I was perplexed by the fact that of the various characters that had a POV, the narratives of two were told in first person (Duchess and Sally) while all the others were in third person. This made no sense and only added to the overall lack of cohesion and focus in the book.Second, why did Towles decide not to use quotation marks? I found this to be distracting and in some cases, confusing.And finally, I was so utterly annoyed by the fact that the first part of the book seems to set the stage for an epic road trip to look for Billy and Emmett's missing mother, but (view spoiler)[that road trip never even happens. The mystery of the missing mother is hardly even mentioned again during the rest of the book. (hide spoiler)]There's no question that Towles can beautifully describe a scene and create engaging characters, but with The Lincoln Highway, he didn't succeed in pulling everything together into a captivating, cohesive tale."
900,4.0,"I started reading this book and about 30 pages in, as soon as they hit the road I got some Jack Kerouc's ""On the Road"" rated G vibes. It's a story of Emmet, who's recently gotten out of juvenile detention for involuntary manslaughter and his brother Billy. They recently lost their father to cancer. The farm they lived on is in foreclosure and now all they have is his car. Emmet's younger brother Billy wants to take a trip to find his mother, so to humor him, Emmets decides to hit the Lincoln Highway and travel to California. It seems like it's just the two of them but things change when two of Emmet's former inmates decide to take the trip with them. Towles has an uncanny ability to draw you in with beautiful prose and flawed, engaging characters. It hits all the elements of humankind--good, bad, and the shocking. I mostly enjoyed the ride and felt a deep connection to some of the storylines, especially Emmet enjoying his FAO Schwarz visit and his simple relationship with his brother. I read a Gentleman in Moscow and consider it to be one of my all time favorite novels. This book as a stand alone may have gotten 4.5 stars, but I couldn't get the ""other"" book out of my mind as the standard for Towles writing and plot. Many people didn't seem to like the ending, but for me the ending seemed fitting and perfect closure to a trip to nowhere and somehow everywhere. "
901,5.0,"…I have lived my life through books…I've read histories and novels, scientific texts and volumes of poetry and one thing I've learned is that there is just enough variety in human experience for every person in a city the size of New York to feel with assurance that their experience is unique. And this is a wonderful thing because to aspire, to fall in love, to stumble as we do and yet soldier on, at some level we must believe that what we are going through has never been experienced quite as we have experienced it.The Lincoln HighwayAmor Towles•Worth. The. Wait.•I dare say that The Lincoln Highway assures Amor Towles's place in the group of elite American novelists. Like many of you I've been awaiting this book for years but there is always the fear...will it be as good? Well, YES. It is.•What elevates Towles to the tier of great novelists is his versatility. Rules of Civility places us in 1930s era NYC as we watch a young woman climb the social ladder; A Gentleman in Moscow puts us under house arrest with Count Rostov in the Metropol Hotel in 1922, and The Lincoln Highway takes us on a 10 day journey in 1954 with two young brothers and two of their friends after one is released from a juvenile work camp.•The title had me believing we would be solely on a cross country adventure, and yet, to my delight, The Lincoln Highway takes place predominantly in NYC. Towles is a master at setting; he is able to capture the essence of a place and his love of NYC shines through his prose here. And I cannot do his prose justice. A lifetime of reading and love of the written word shines through onto every page.•This is a story about the bonds of friendship and the innocence of youth. It celebrates ordinary lives, but the story is anything but ordinary. I would not have thought it would deliver a nail biting ending, and yet it did. I found myself completely attached to Emmett, Billy, Duchess and Woolly; this book is the trifecta; character, setting, plot.•I can find no fault here and I think this is destined to be an American classic. And now I am back to waiting for his next book…until then."
902,5.0,"In the 1950s, 18-year-old Emmett and his 8-year-old brother Billy set off to find their mother in California following their father's death. But before they get far, their plans are derailed by Woolly and Duchess, two of Emmett's acquaintances from a juvenile detention facility. What follows is an epic, meandering roadtrip to New York City instead. I wasn't sure about the novel as I plowed through the 576 pages, but I am glad I trusted Towles. All four main characters are complex, well developed, and nuanced. Lost, seemingly innocent Woolly became my favorite character. Reliable, responsible Emmett always did the right thing. Precise, curious, trusting Billy. And the character I loved to hate, Duchess. Packed with literary references, allusions, and side characters galore, I think I would pick up on even more upon a re-read. I had heard some fellow readers complain about the ending, but it really worked for me. Although this didn't quite measure up to A Gentleman in Moscow, I loved The Lincoln Highway. "
903,5.0,"I’ve loved all of Towles’s books, and A Gentleman in Moscow is my favorite, ever, of all time. So I expected to love The Lincoln Highway. I didn’t expect to be on pins and needles for almost 600 pages, or to feel emotionally invested in so many characters - including some who might not have been as likable as they appeared at the beginning. The characters were so well drawn - at the beginning, I thought they might be so quirky/unique that they didn’t seem entirely real … but over time, those idiosyncrasies were exactly what made them seem like people I may have passed on the sidewalk. I need to read this again, now that I know how it all comes together, just to notice all the things I didn’t catch while I was freaking out about all the bad decisions people were making and not knowing how they were going to get out of it.I want to think through or figure out : -Who takes themselves seriously (and who doesn’t) and how it impacts their choices. -Was the character I thought was mentally ill, really that? Or was he a terrible person?-Parts of this felt like a Shakespearean plot, right? -What was Wooly’s medicine? What was it for?-Who was the villain? Everyone? No one? -Did people’s backstories affect how responsible for their actions they are or should be? The tone of The Lincoln Highway feels very different than A Gentleman in Moscow. The same hallmarks are there - witty repartee (though not as much as AGIM), beautiful writing with a few alliterations thrown in for fun, an interesting premise, and characters you want to spend time with. But it feels a bit more madcap (which is largely one character’s doing) and there are some darker moments for several of the characters, and I’m still reeling from the ending. So, while it wasn’t what I was expecting at all, I cannot stop thinking about it. Which hasn’t happened in a long time."
904,5.0,"I fell in love with A GENTLEMAN IN MOSCOW in 2016, and now I'd read anything Towles writes. Told in spare yet elegant prose, THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY opens with 18-year-old Emmett being driven home from a juvenile detention center by a warden. Emmett is mature, thoughtful, responsible, and determined to get away from his home town with his precocious and charming younger brother in the 1948 Studebaker Land Cruiser he owns. (I felt Emmett and his brother Billy don't really change over the course of the novel.) But two other young men from the detention facility have hidden in the trunk of the warden's car ... and enter trouble in the form of one of them, Duchess. In its use of the road as a space where challenges occur and where characters encounter a variety of individuals in a series of episodes, the book has elements of a picaresque novel (e.g. Don Quixote). This book reminded me of Lou Berney's historical novel NOVEMBER ROAD, which won the Edgar for best novel, I believe. It also has hints of Steinbeck's OF MICE AND MEN. Very different from GENTLEMAN, but thoroughly enjoyable."
905,4.0,"4 stars! Listened to part of this book and read part; I believe I appreciated the writing more reading it then listening although the narrators were great. I agree with Jenna and Al Roker that these characters will be known in classical literature in the future. Emmett and Billy have a beautiful relationship and the way Towels weaves in other supporting characters and a work of literature is phenomenal. He is an exquisite storyteller layering story upon story then reverts back to the main theme running throughout the 576 page novel. A work of art indeed to be enjoyed by many throughout the ages.Favorite quote:“Wouldn’t it had been wonderful, thought Woolly, that if everybody’s life was like a piece in a jigsaw puzzle. Then no one person’s life would ever be an inconvenience to anyone else’s. It would just fit snuggly in its very own, specially designed spot, and in doing so, would enable the whole intricate picture to become complete.”"
906,5.0,"5 stars. This book needs a sequel!Emmett and his brother, Billy, have plans to move to California from their small town in Nebraska. Duchess and Woolly, however, have plans of their own, which lead the four of them eastward toward New York. Billy carries with him his favorite book, Professor Abernathe's Compendium of Heroes, Adventurers, and Other Intrepid Travelers, and reads the abridged stories it contains to the many people they encounter. Indeed The Lincoln Highway reads in a way like Billy's Compendium, with its ever expanding cast of characters, many of whom share their own varied stories of adventure and travel.I had high hopes for this story from the very beginning, having loved A Gentleman in Moscow, and it did not disappoint. The Lincoln Highway was not what I had expected in the best possible way. I felt so many emotions throughout the story, especially at the end, which contained some really surprising events. A definitely contender for my favorite book of 2021."
907,5.0,"I absolutely love the way this author writes. A Gentleman in Moscow is one of my all time favorite reads and Amor Towels didn’t disappoint me with this new novel of his. The characters are multi-dimensional and have many layers that are slowly revealed. Told over 10 days of a road trip in 1954 by two orphan brothers, each day is a section of the book that has multiple voices, interspersing between third person and first person narrative. The characters, both major and minor ones are memorable. Sally was a favorite, with Billy and Wooly close behind. It is over 600 pages, but honestly didn’t feel like it was that long. (I was admittedly surprised by the last chapter.). Highly recommend this book. As the jacket cover says, “…will satisfy fans of his multilayered literary styling while providing them an array of new and richly imagined settings, characters, and themes. “. Oh, what will he write next???? Can’t wait. "
908,5.0,"I'm not going to bury the lead here;I loved The Lincoln Highway by Amor Towles.There's nothing fancy or post-modern about this book.It has no literary bells and whistles, no fancy tricks or structural innovations, it's just a good old-fashioned story, impeccably told through the voices of a cast of friends, enemies, brothers and misfits.I was going to save this for my summer holiday read. It's well over 500 pages, so i was fantasising about getting stuck into it over the December holidays, but i just couldn't wait.i thought i'd skim the first few pages, but once i was in, i was in. By page 6, as the warden drove off from dropping Emmett at his family farm, after he's finished serving his sentence, i knew it was for me.I loved Towles' Gentleman in Moscow, and will line up Rules of Civility as soon as possible.Need a good read you can sink into? I can recommend this one."
909,4.0,"A picaresque novel set in the 1950s (though it smacks of the Dirty Thirties), with a gang of “lost” boys hitting the road. Emmett, 18, has just been released from a work farm where he served 15 months for involuntary manslaughter. In the meantime, his father died and their family farm has been seized by the bank. With their mother long gone, Emmett intends to pick up his 8-year-old brother, Billy, his Studebaker and a small stash of hidden cash and head west. But life has other plans, in the form of two pals from the work farm, who derail Emmett’s plan 180 degrees and take them all towards New York. Lots of adventures ensue, always teetering on the brink of disaster but somehow coming right in the end. Stuffed with unsubtle allusions to myth and legend (young Billy’s most treasured possession is a big book of stories of adventurers from history, fiction and myth). Genial and entertaining. "
910,4.0,"Well.....I have no word to describe this book. What the heck just happened? What's up with the turn of events in the last 1/3 of the book?? I'm — UGHHHH!!! Not sure if I should give this a 4 stars.....feels like 3.5 to me, since 1) it took me TWO WEEKS to finish it; 2) the random turns of events was a little offputting; and 3) Towles seem to throw Sally, a potentially most compelling female character, into the mix like an afterthought — that's a bit annoying. This one didn't spark joys within me like 'A Gentleman--' and now I'm very confused 🥲OK, might round this down to 3 in the next few hours...we'll see. The story also took a strange turn around the end that makes it feel like a fragment of John Steinbeck 's books. Not particularly a good thing, in this case, since it's been written out like Little Miss Sunshine for the majority of it. Things kind of fell into places in a rather convenient fashion, and the ending! Oh man, don't get me started I—"
911,5.0,"Amor Towles is an automatic read for me. In The Lincoln Highway, he strays a bit from his first two novels, but it was no less delightful to read (and make no mistake, it is not a fast read). With strong references to the Odyssey, and touching on other classic adventure stories, including, but not limited to Huck Finn and The Wizard of Oz, I found this story to be a reminder of the simple joys brought about by the shared experiences of a road trip (with unexpected turns being the most memorable), and a loving ode to an Americana of days gone by.Fun connections: 1) The Lincoln Highway starts on June 12, 1954, and ends ten days later, putting the date at June 21, 1954, which, incidentally, is the same date as the last chapter of A Gentleman in Moscow.2) Woolly's uncle, Wallace Wolcott, is a character in Rules of Civility."
912,4.0,"Towles is a true storyteller. I didn’t like this as much as A Gentleman in Moscow but I still found it good. I like that the author isn’t stuck writing the same type of story across his books. I think my hold up on giving it five stars is I was so frustrated with Duchess. He was a good character that stayed true to his character but was so frustrating to read about. Overall, I loved the various adventures and unexpected stops along the way. Giving voice to so many characters is beautiful.“When we’re young, so much time is spent teaching us the importance of keeping our vices in check. Our anger, our envy, our pride. But when I look around, it seems to me that so many of our lives end up being hampered by a virtue instead. If you take a trait that by all appearances is a merit—a trait that is praised by pastors and poets, a trait that we have come to admire in our friends and hope to foster in our children—and you give it to some poor soul in abundance, it will almost certainly prove an obstacle to their happiness. Just as someone can be too smart for their own good, there are those who are too patient for their own good, or too hardworking.”"
913,4.0,"This is a good story. However, I wouldn't categorize it as a great story. The character development is fantastic. Everyone's strengths, weaknesses and strange habits are nicely defined. But the title is somewhat misleading. It's less a story about the first highway in America that ran from coast to coast, and more so a story about the wild and crazy adventures of four young males who each hope to head in a different direction for their own personal reasons. Along the way, they encounter all manner of interesting people and problem situations that must be overcome before continuing on their merry way. The author is a gifted writer with a knack for making the reader constantly stop and think. "
914,3.0,"Although I still am processing this book, my initial reaction is one of frustration. It was nearly 600 pages and it took me too long to finish. I never felt super invested in the story, but I thought the ending would tie everything together and make me appreciate it more. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed in the ending for multiple reasons. There were characters I loved and wanted to hear more from, such as Billy, Emmett, and Sally, and too many unnecessary subplots with characters that I felt were overdeveloped for no reason. Towles is a beautiful writer, but I just didn’t connect with this story. "
915,5.0,"“How easily we forget-we in the business of storytelling-that life was the point all along.” Sometimes, all too rarely, a book comes along that grabs you by the heartstrings and strums them so thoroughly that by the last page you can’t decide whether you’re exhausted or exhilarated. A book full of oddball, charmingly endearing characters that you love from their first introduction, despite their obvious flaws. A book that makes you laugh and cry, makes you anxious to get to the end and anxious to get finished too soon. A book for the ages. This is such a book. I loved A Gentleman in Moscow. It’s one of my top ten books of all time (which I really need to write down somewhere, so that when I’m old and forgetful, I can reread them all). When I saw that Amor Towles had a new book out and it dropped the weekend of my 60th birthday; well, that just felt like a moment to splurge on the hard cover and enjoy, which I did. The Lincoln Highway has topped Gentleman, I think. At least, right now in the afterglow of finishing this fabulous story, it does. Maybe when I return to reality it’ll settle into a place somewhere lower in my esteem, but I really don’t think so. Five stars isn’t enough for this one."
916,4.0,"I often found myself laughing while I listened to this one, probably shouldn't have, but man...at times this came off like a Three Stooges or Laurel and Hardy show. I really liked Emmett, felt like he got the shaft when he got sent away, liked how he was determined to take care of Billy and give them a good life. I thought his plan of working on houses and becoming a landlord was a good one. But man was Emmett dense about Sarah.Billy always made me smile. He was so smart, it was a bit scary. I loved how Billy saw life, loved how he had his book, and seemed to live his life according to the book, which seemed odd at first, but the more the book went on, the more it made sense.Wooly, it was hard not to like him. I felt bad for him, that he seems to have gotten the shaft his whole life. I also hated how Duchess seemed to take advantage of him and how Wooly's family treated him. In today's world, he would be not quite all there, nothing wrong with that, he was such a good pure soul, a big kid. I really hate the choice that he made at the end.Duchess....well, this guy, we all know a guy like this, one who seems like your friend, but is always looking out for himself, is always the hero in his stories, when really he causes chaos in his wake and unless specifically told no, it's a yes. So many of Emmett's problems were because of Dutchess. I kinda liked the fate he was left too. It gave me hope that Emmett and Billy would get their dreams come true."
917,5.0,"The way I feel about this book: 🥺. The characters had my heart the whole way through. I cried on a run while listening to a sad part near the end. I listened to the last 2 minutes over again because I just needed to (I’m usually not a huge last page girl but these final lines really hit me in the gut). Like what more can I ask for than a bunch of misfit boys/teens on a road trip? Woolly and Billy…I love them so much. This isn’t even a review, just a gush. If you like historical fiction then this one’s for you!"
918,5.0,"From the first page it's clear this book has spunk. An all round great read.Each of the characters is developed so realistically and so deeply, you feel like you understand each of them in the way only an omnipotent narrator can truly know it's characters.The way the story is told from the different perspectives of each of the characters is not a new idea but they Towles executed this was flawless. Even how Wooly's parts weren't done in the first person so you could only ever get to know him from arm's length. I loved how Sally fed into the storyline. She is a brilliant character albeit not a main one. I thought the way she fit into the story was brilliant and unexpected.How each of these characters movements were intertwined to impact one another was woven together so elegantly, it was seriously beautiful to read."
919,3.0,"3.5THE LINCOLN HIGHWAY by Amor Towles tells the story of Emmett, an 18-year old Nebraskan boy who just served a sentence for manslaughter, his brother, and a load of other characters as they travel on the Lincoln Highway in 1954. Spanning over the course of just ten days, this novel explores themes of masculinity, loneliness, and what it means to be a hero. Overall, I did enjoy this book. Each and every character is a fully-realized individual with their own flaws and strengths. Each person is compelling and I genuinely was excited to see where their stories would end up.However, while I am partial to a long book, this novel was absurdly long. The ARC I received was nearly 600 pages. I think the final hardcover is around 400, but that just might mean the type is smaller.The sheer girth of this story drowned what could have been a compelling tale of what it means to become your father and how to escape the cyclical nature of our parents’ mistakes. But because this was so bloated with unnecessary flashbacks and peripheral details, the meaning and power of the novel was diluted. While I do understand that the point of the ancillary stories was to make the reader feel a certain emotion, I don’t think that emotion was supposed to be boredom.However, I did enjoy this and thought the writing was lovely. And I always love Nebraska rep! I haven’t read Towles’ previous novels, but if you’ve enjoyed him in the past, I’d give this one a go.Thank you to Viking Books for this advanced copy in exchange for an honest review. The Lincoln Highway comes out on 10/5/21."
920,4.0,"It is finished! I’ve been working on this one for weeeeeks and thanks to a few vacation days I finally got it done. His other two, A Gentleman in Moscow especially, were better in my opinion but his writing really is top-notch and even though this story was a bit slower it was still so good. I loved Billy and his relationship with Emmett, Wooly, and all the adventures they shared after a mishap thanks to escaped juvenile prisoners. Towles writes in a way that’s so simple but so poignant, and I always finish his books feeling both happy and sad. "
921,4.0,"©2021 EPL new bookEmmett, Duchess, Woolley and Billy are the main characters in this layered story trying to travel the Lincoln Highway. The literary references in the writing are enjoyable (i.e. Count of Monte Cristo, 3 Musketeers, etc.)This historical (1950s)tale of male travels and travails is the 4th such book I've read this year - interesting. (West With Giraffes, This Tender Land and American Dirt were the others.)"
922,5.0,"Towles is a master of his craft. The pacing, the chapters written in different points of view, the unexpected landscape… there is so much packed in this book, even considering its length. I’d finish one of Billy’s chapters and think, he’s my favorite. Then Duchess would come along… no, he’s my favorite. And on. I loved going on this journey with such elegant, graceful writing as guide. (And, it’s not everyday you get chills down your arms on the last page!) "
923,4.0,"3.5 rounded up. It was fine. But too long and the characters, although charming at first quickly grew too twee for me, like they are theatrical from the 20's instead of regular 18 year olds from the 50's. I just found myself putting it down so easily with 100 pages left and I found it really hard to care. I know I'm in the tiny minority but I think even though I want to love Amor Towles so much, I've read and had the same issue with all his books, maybe he's just not for me. But I do love the time period. The 50's I think is my favorite time period. "
924,5.0,"“Wouldn’t it be wonderful if everybody’s life was like a piece in a jigsaw puzzle. Then no one person’s life would ever be an inconvenience to anyone else’s. It would just fit snugly in its very own, specially designed spot, and in so doing, would enable the whole intricate picture to become complete.”What a wonderful cast of characters this book was made of. Amor Towles is quite the storyteller, and I thoroughly enjoyed this journey of shenanigans made by this cast of characters."
925,5.0,"A book like this one is very rare. Towles manages to thread the needle between high interest, well paced narrative, and incredibly elegant prose structure. This book is easily as good or better than A Gentleman in Moscow. The Lincoln Highway is at times Steinbeckian with a clear-eyed grasp of the time and place of 1950's midwest. However, his deft handling of character development, as they travel back and forth through timelines, feels effortless. This author is at the height of his powers.This book gets my strongest recommendation. This book is a masterpiece."
926,4.0,"More like 3.5 stars. I have mixed feelings about this book. I absolutely loved the way it was written, and the character development was phenomenal. However, I don't feel like the plot that was set up at the beginning of the book was ever addressed. Either way, I would still recommend this book to a friend. The characters are beautifully done. "
927,4.0,"This book is very different from A Gentleman in Moscow. At first, that threw me for a loop, as I love GiM so much and wanted more of the same. But the characters in Lincoln Highway are interesting and endearing, with distinct voices. And there’s a thread of heroes and journeys and unexpected events that weaves subtly but expertly throughout the story. The only thing that kept this from being 5 stars was the ending. It felt, if not forced, then truncated, and a little confusing. But mostly a more than worthwhile read."
928,5.0,"Towles’ new book kept my attention just as A Gentleman in Moscow had previously. The detailed descriptions of people, places, and things make the reader feel comfortable with all of the above without becoming overly burdensome to the point feeling that there is too much to wade through.The Lincoln Highway is divided into ten “chapters”, starting with number Ten and ending with chapter “One”. Each chapter contains individual sections, each named for and giving the viewpoint of one of the characters on the same point or activity in the story. An exception is in the section for Abacus in chapter Two. Here, Abacus describes the form that anyone’s life takes over the course of birth to death. Life takes the form of a diamond on its side. From the fine point of birth, one’s life expands by experiencing an ever growing number of encounters with people and circumstances. At some point those encounters begin to diminish, memory begins to fade, friends die or contact is lost until, finally, one reaches the end point, death.A highly recommended read."
929,5.0,Absolutely the best book I have read in a long time. The characters with all their hopes and dreams and flaws come to life as the reader follows them on their 10 day journey. The writing is exquisite and the set-up is perfection.
930,2.0,"I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.
 “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”
And these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:
 “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”
Some of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:
 “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”
And I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————

The premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. 
 “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”
This may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.
 “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”
In that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.
“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
And then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.
 “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”
And if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.


 “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”
And all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. 
“I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” 
2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————
“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too."
931,5.0,"“The only way to learn is to live”Fuck, this book hit me so hard. I finished this book a few days ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn't see the point of life, but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life. This book was so beautifully written and I love the way this book asks the question: what is the best way to live?“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”It's a really cool concept, that between life and death you enter the midnight library, where you get the opportunity to see how your life would've been different had you made different decisions. I think a lot about this, what my life would be like had I made different choices and wondering if I'm the happiest version of myself? This book forces you to ask hard questions, like what makes a life worth living? And are your dreams for yourself really something you want? I love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life. “A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”Matt Haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes I'm obsessed with in this book. Much like The Humans (one of my all time favorites) this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be. But I feel like this book is much more serious than The Humans, there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book, and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book, where as The Humans feels a lot more light-hearted and hilarious. 
“It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy. We can't tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.”
But god damn, I loved this book. I cried a lot at the end. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. I also filmed a reading vlog and I included this book, you can see that here: https://youtu.be/9NiJtrbogyo"
932,2.0,"Everybody probably knows the premise of this book by now (I mean this book is everywhere): a library with an infinite number of books. The books of regret. You open one and it transfers you to the life where you didn’t make that particular regret. Was it marrying someone or traveling or maybe other little things.While I admit I don’t actively pursue parallel universes kind of books on one hand, and on the other, the main reason why I read this book is that I was choosing the best fiction this year (to vote in the GR awards), I was actually looking forward to it. Most of my friends on GR gave it 5 stars. A book beloved by the majority... I had a high chance of enjoying it. Sadly, I didn’t.First, it was boring. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn’t the best, honestly. Not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone. It certainly didn’t help either that I was listening to Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine at the same time, in which the narrator was so animated reading the book.I also found all of Nora’s revelations and enlightenment typical. Like sure I already know that. The ending was also painfully predictable from the start. So when you can guess where the book is going, everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore, especially if you don’t care about the main character. Unfortunately, I found Nora dull. She wasn’t interesting as the main character and I couldn’t relate nor care about her and empathise with her story. I can’t believe she was this multitalented in fields that aren’t related whatsoever to each other. She could’ve been an athlete, a scholar or a musician. All successful. All based on life decisions. I also think that she had the privilege of choosing such different options. Many don’t. I don’t mean by that the book of regrets but rather focusing on a particular career path from the start. For example, many parents don’t nurture their children’s interests like music or gymnastics for several reasons maybe they can’t afford it or they just don’t care. But Nora had so many options. Luckily, the book was short. I also didn’t hate anything about it, hence the 2-star rating. But at the same time, I can’t name anything I liked. Maybe one of the lives in particular was more intriguing than the rest because of the two characters we met and.. the concept. It didn’t help that the book got repetitive sometimes. The premise was much more promising than the book itself. The “message” was also pretty plain obvious. Yet many liked The Midnight Library, however. So it might be more of a “me and not you” kind of book. But let me tell you this: if you don’t find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories, don’t read this novel. Don’t be fooled with “LIBRARY. MIDNIGHT LIBRARY. BOOOOOKS.” The library is just more of a metaphor. Most of the events of this book take place in the real world. And unless you’re interested in kind of self-help books (or motivational ones), don’t read this novel either. Because it’s more about what Nora discovered about herself and life, of course, by dealing with/trying to escape from her regrets.But then again, the majority liked this book so you might too and it's simply not my cup of tea. Yet, it was a dreadfully boring."
933,5.0,"Okay! No more words! This is one of the best sci-fi dances with fantasy which carries additional philosophic vibes novel of the year! I LOVED IT! ( this is not kind of toasting for the book and raising your glass kind of loving it. This is more like climbing at the top of the roof and declaring your love by shouting and howling to the moon kind of love. If you read the song lyrics of “ Howl” at the book you may probably understand why I feel so enthusiastic and why I’m writing a high volume review!) This book is not only about Nora Seed who is trapped in her life, seeing herself a failure, a disposable human waste who has nothing to achieve, will never be missed by anyone . It’s about regrets, unfinished plans, what ifs, approval of families, drugs, mistakes, giving up, realizing other people’s dreams, self regret, insecurities, self harm, love, passion and hate...When Nora tries to end her life, she opens her eyes in a library filled with books which contain different versions of her life story. If she finds the right book and most proper life she can live fulfilled and happy, that will mean she can be saved! Thankfully the librarian Mrs. Elm here for here just like she has done when she was a little girl who recently learned she lost her dad. Nora could be a swimmer, a rock star, a philosopher, a wife, a traveler, a glaciologist, a mother, winery or local pub owner. She can say “yes” to her ex and accept his offer to live in a small town and own a local pub. Or she can say “yes” to coffee offer of a nice doctor candidate Ash to pursue happiness and love. She can win Olympic medals or she can taste the tempting charm of fame with her songs she writes and performs all around the world. She can be everything or anything. But after living so much lives, nearly thousand different versions, will she find which is best for her and which life form will suit to catch the real happiness? Can she live without family members or can she handle losing her friends to death? What does she really want? What does she expect ? And most importantly will she learn to face the things she regrets the most? Because however she’s ready to start her fresh life with open hands, those clutches of regret always pull her back and prevent her to see what she’s really looking for! Beautiful, meaningful, dazzling, emotional, heart wrenching, poetic, realistic : these are the words which come to my mind after reading this book. Just like the definition of ideal life. Sigh...bloginstagramfacebooktwitter"
934,3.0,"Okay. Picture this: you are about to bite into a cookie. A big, warm cookie. Kinda crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, yummy and chocolate chip-y and presumably made with brown butter and flaky sea salt, as all the best cookies are.And then you take a big ol' chomp, and...oh no. Not a chocolate chip at all.This cookie is filled with...RAISINS.Have you immersed yourself in that experience? Really felt the high expectations and the all-consuming disappointment?Good.Because that was my experience with this book.This is not a bad book, necessarily, just like raisin-y cookies are not a bad food. (They are closer to granola bars than cookies, but my favorite in the Chewy Granola Bar Variety Pack was always oatmeal raisin, like a six-year-old grumpy old man, so that's not a negative in my personal lexicon.)It's just that it could be much better.

""That is just me. I add nothing. I am wallowing in self-pity.""
No truer words have been said by Nora, the world's largest wet blanket. Woe is her, folks.Nora ends up at The Midnight Library, a place between life and death, because she doesn't want to live anymore. The library is full of books, each representing a life she could've had, had she made different choices. Now she has a chance to undo all her numerous regrets and to try out all the lives she's missed out on, to see if there is another one she would like better.Lest you think I'm cold-hearted for not loving this, I assure you, I'm not. Normally, I love sappy, cheesy, inspirational mush. I watch Hallmark movies. I believe in soulmates and happily ever after. I cry during every sweet scene in every movie. And yet this book left me so cold inside, and I'll try to put into words why.For one thing, this story doesn't come across as fiction so much as self-help disguised as fiction. The lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning, yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be understood if explained slowly and repeatedly. We are forced to endure these lessons over and over every time Nora goes back to the library. Either Nora is the most dim-witted of characters, or the author thinks us readers are.Another problem is that it's really hard to connect with Nora. She'll take a situation, suck every ounce of joy out of it, and interpret what's left in the most negative way possible. She's full of regret for every decision she's ever made, and thinks the grass is always greener. However, other than being negative, she literally has no other personality traits. She's a blank slate, dull and uninteresting. I also have issues with the core messages in this book. Nora finally learns her lesson, but only after having fixated on each regret, remade every decision, and lived all subsequent lives. I'm also uncomfortable with the implication that if you're depressed, you only need to change your outlook and you will feel better. That goes against everything we understand about mental illness, including that it's important to seek out professional help, that it can be chemically based, and that it's not a matter of not trying hard enough.So many readers loved this book, as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews. But it's just not for me. This is the second book I've read by Matt Haig, and I've had trouble connecting with both. So I think it's time I part ways with this author and just accept that we are not compatible."
936,5.0,"It is no secret that Matt Haig has mental health issues, dogged by the darkness of depression that has taken its toll on his life. His acute observations and experience of his condition informs this exquisite, inspiring, compassionate and empathetic novel where he creates the concept of the midnight library, to be found in the spaces between life and death, to explore life, the issues that afflict our world, through philosophy and more, endeavouring to tease out what might make life worth living and a joy and what gives it meaning. The device used to implement his goal is the ordinary Nora Seed, who has lived her life trying to please others, who has hit rock bottom, suffering the loss of her cat, her job, overwhelmed by the burden of a lifetime of regrets, seeing no light in her life whatsoever. She is tempted by thoughts of suicide that has her ending up at the midnight library.The midnight library is magical, for a start, the library has a limitless number of books, and these books are far from ordinary, Haig sprinkles gold dust in each book, offering Nora the opportunity to see how her life would have turned out if each and every decision at every point in her life had been different. The books illustrate the endless possibilities that life holds for Nora and all of us. Nora explores each book, with inquisitiveness and curiosity, the widely disparate lives that could have been hers, no easy task as she has to slip into each new life with the complications of being unfamiliar with it and do so without alerting the other people present. It soon becomes clear that there are pros and cons to each book/life, to each decision and choice made, each life containing its own mix of despair, pain and regrets that must be accommodated and handled.Haig offers a touching narrative that speaks of the joys to be found in living, attained through Nora's eyes as she tries to untangle what really matters in life, putting life in context and perspective with all its ongoing changes, complexities, and an understanding no life is perfect in itself. In some ways, this is a version of It's A Wonderful Life, a favourite film for so many people. What I was so struck by is just how many readers might find this helpful for our lock down times, so many have suffered unbearable losses and illness, have had to face not seeing all those we love and mean so much to us, whilst being weighed down with worries and concerns about how to cope with fears regarding jobs, childcare, money and more. A beautifully nuanced novel that I am sure many will love as much as me. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Canongate for an ARC."
937,3.0,"Unpopular opinion! In between life and death is a library, The Midnight Library. With books curated just for you..You will start with “The book of Regrets” your regrets, which could be “not telling your father you loved him before he died”, not marrying a certain sweetheart or not following a dream. Select another volume and see how a different choice may have played out.Discover that an alternate choices may not have necessarily led to a different outcome.This is a MAGICAL premise! But, I must be honest. As much as I wanted to LOVE this, I just wasn’t AS riveted by the explorations of “what could have been”. This will appeal to those who enjoy stories which revolve around sliding doors, alternate realities and time travel. That isn’t me. I gravitated toward it because of the appeal of the library.We all know that books resonate (or don’t resonate) with readers based on our own personal experiences. Perhaps if you share a certain regret with our leading lady, Nora, you will connect with this book more than I did. Perhaps, it was just timing.This book has almost all 5 star reviews, so please read others for an alternate opinion. Or, if you are one of the few, who like me, LOVED the idea more than the story, know now that there is at least one other person who felt the same way as you."
938,5.0,"(4.5?) After loving The Humans, I was very excited for this new release and I wasn't let down!The main character is full of regrets after attempting suicide and ends up in a library where she gets to try all the other lives she could have lived.This books was heartbreaking and unputdownable. My main regret is starting it late at night because I had to wait until the next day to finish it!The writing was beautiful and hit almost too close for comfort. I can't recommend it enough!(view spoiler)[The only portion that made me nervous was towards the end. I'm always wary of the ""a husband and a child will fix this woman"". Luckily, it wasn't the case! (hide spoiler)]"
939,5.0,"okay WOW. This was amazing.I must say that I was kind of skeptical? going into this because the idea is SO good that I didn't know if the writing would be able to live up to it (which can sometimes happen)... but alas, no! Haig's prose is fast-paced and easy to read, but also believable and deeply philosophical. There is just so much to learn from this book. I mean, you COULD read a self-help book on stoicism, or you could just read this :)"
940,2.0,"Corny like a Hallmark movie and probably the least subtle book I've ever read.Update: for those butthurt about my sentence-long review I just wanted to say that as a person who also struggles with depression, this book will become my 13th reason if y'all keep trying to defend it to me (jk)"

Because I had lost my way?""""Well, yes. But now you are lost within your lostness.""This story is so fascinating and one of the most amazing stories that look into life, dissect it and offer too many chances to live in each making us wonder what could have been if we we're given a chance to live in each.It talks about regrets, relationships, dreams, pets, friendships and other relationships, what-could-have-beens and most importantly how to live in the present and make the most use of it. The writing is amazing and picks up really fast. Once you get into the book, it's hard to put it down. A thought provoking story, it will make you wonder things about your own life and what you could have been in the infinite other universes. It makes me believe that I can do so much in my life at the moment and learn what I could have done from the things that happened instead of regretting about it. A must read. It will make you want to have a hard look at your life and make you think about the many unimportant things that you've been worrying about all your life and instead make you want to focus on the things that really matter.A sci-fi, fantasy, contemporary kind of writing makes the narration so effortless, fast-paced, interesting and intriguing.Loved it."

The Written Review


Life has just gotten to the point where it's overwhelming and all-encompassing and above all, Nora can't see a possible situation where it gets better. Everyone she's ever known has pulled away, her job is gone and her best friend in the world passes. All she's left with is herself and a cripplingly black hole.She slips herself a few too many pills and then drifts...and finds herself in a library.Not just any library though, the Midnight Library.Guided by a person who may (or may not) be Mrs. Elm (young Nora's favorite teacher), Nora begins to take a look at the shelves.And every book is her. Well. A version of her. Other lives that she could've lived, decisions and paths she could've pursued.If you could undo any and all ""bad"" decisions you make, would you?In short, this book was amazing. Really, truly.I struggled to write my summary cause I didn't want to give too much away - so much of my joy of this book comes from just discovering where this story led.The world-building and the writing were phenomenal. It felt like I was marking a new quote on every page cause so much of it was THAT good.Nora's character felt so real and she got me all teary so many times. I loved the ethereal magic of the Midnight Library and the various mind-bending scenarios that Nora went through. All in all - this book was amazing and I could not recommend it more!

945,3.0,"This is a quaint little book. A quick read that I enjoyed. It is another form of the Groundhog Day plots that I have read this year. The library in this book is an infinite number of lives not taken. The opening is a little depressing, but it has to be to establish the motivation for the rest of the story. Even so there is a continued darkness in the tone. With each life to which the character ventures she only has to not like it in order to move on to the next. She is in constant search of that perfect life. The conflict of the book is set by page 38 and the pace increases. I am in constant search of the “Fictive Dream,” where I get buried in the story and the rest of my world falls away. The structure of this book, the constant shifting from life to life gives the story an episodic feel. This story is an odyssey and the character evolves as she comes to realize what life is really all about."
946,1.0,"What a shame - this could have been such a great novel if the author had the capacity to write about the issues of regrets and suicidal thoughts with maturity, complexity and depth. Instead, we get this young-adult-like novel in which the main character behaves and thinks like a 15-year-old, and every other character around her is just a cardboard poster rather than a human being. This is not what I expected from Matt Haig, whose previous books I recommended to people who wanted to understand depression. It's like it isn't the same author at all. I can't believe how silly and superficial its treatment of its topics is. Even with the fantastic elements of the premise, this could have been so much better."

948,4.0,"Magical “Let’s be kind to the people in our own existence.” The Midnight Library is a book about choices, regrets, and embracing life. Nora Seed is having a really bad day. She is mugged, loses her job, blamed for other’s people’s failures, and her cat is run over by a car. She is also seriously depressed. This day is one of many bad days that Nora has experienced over the last decade of her life. She can’t take life anymore and attempts suicide.Nora wakes up to discover that she is in the space between life and death known as The Midnight Library. Here, Nora is given the opportunity to take the paths she didn’t choose and undo her regrets. She travels into the multiverse, getting to experience her other lives. What she finds is that the grass isn’t always greener, and in order to live, one must push aside their regrets and embrace their potential. “She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential.There are many versions of Nora, but she finds she is the same person in every life she chooses. She might be happier, but she doesn’t have what she needs, which is love. She cannot heal until she can open up and accept the love of others, but also love herself and recognize her value. I love Nora’s character. I felt all of her emotions, the dark, and the light. She is fragile, desperate, adventurous, a rockstar, a loving sister, a good friend, a kind neighbor, a good teacher, and, most importantly, a survivor.This is my first book by Matt Haig and I love how he weaves in bits of magic, fantasy, and whimsy alongside Quantum physics, literature, and philosophy.This is an emotional read. Reading about a character who is in such a desperate state of mind that they attempt to take their life wasn’t easy, but the other side of this book offers a lot of love, warmth, compassion, and healing. It was surprisingly heartwarming and uplifting.  Nora’s story inspired me to turn off the channel of regrets that often fill my head and embrace the here and now.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Penguin Group in exchange for an honest review."

Also, while it starts a bit dark, I think people who are looking for a way out of a dark place might find this story uplifting overall.I have been sitting here thinking about how to review this book and I don’t want to say too much about it because after 10 pages or so, everything little thing would be a spoiler! That, in itself, should probably pique your interest; it is so packed with interconnected and surprising content I can barely even talk about it! So, just read it because all the stuff that happens is totally worth it . . . I’ll leave it at that.I was hooked by this book from page one. It is not a long book and because it was written so well, it flew right by. If you are looking for a well written and unique story that I believe will appeal to people with a wide variety of interests, The Midnight Library is worth giving a try."

953,5.0,"I ABSOLUTELY, TOTALLY, UNEQUIVOCALLY LOVED THIS BOOK!!!Who hasn't had regrets - wished they'd taken a different path in life, loved more and hated less, studied a little harder, applied themselves a bit more, had more faith in themselves, wished they'd liked themselves for who they were instead of what others wanted them to be?I'm certainly not immune, and I've actually fulfilled a couple of my life's ambitions, but life is not easy for any of us. As Nora was to discover, we all ""fear life"" to some degree - we learn pretty young that actions can have pretty painful consequences. Some of us stare that fear in the face and do what frightens us anyway. Many more of us, however, will step back and opt to take the safer road. I loved the notion of Nora being able to insert herself in a parallel timeline and see how her life would have been like had she taken a chance on all of those potentially life changing events. The whole parallel universe notion was so tantalizing! Imagine if you, too, could examine and then finally burn your own Book of Regrets and just move on with living your best life now?The first third of this novel is heavily mired in depression. If you've never felt stuck or depressed, you will certainly get a clue of what it feels like after you've read or listened to those first few chapters leading up to Nora's attempted suicide. There was a history of depression in Nora's mother's family. I was not surprised that Nora fell into depression after taking care of her mother during her long, protracted illness. Death has a way of stopping the clock for the survivors and making them examine the value of their own life. I suspect there will be many who will identify with most of what Nora thinks and says in this novel. Nora's Midnight Library is guarded and managed by her beloved childhood mentor and high school librarian, Mrs. Elm. There are several chapters devoted to Mrs. Elm's struggle to get Nora to try to experience one of the parallel lives in her Midnight library. This reflects the very real battle that a person with depression must face to get to the point where they can finally admit that they need help to get ""unstuck."" Matt Haig has given a whole new meaning to the word ""potential."" I totally agreed with Nora's final decision at the end of the book. In fact, I saw it coming even before she had completed her first journey. We can't live someone else's life. The choice must truly be our own if we want any abiding sense of fulfillment.This author - this book - has a lot to teach us. I am so very glad that I decided to check out what all the hype was about: turns out, all that hype was fully merited ! Loved every bit of it, including the sad parts. A full five out of five glowing stars for this heart-stirring, sanity-saving novel. We all need to burn our own book of regrets... and just get on with living our best life NOW! Highly, highly recommended!Note: I listened to the audiobook version, very ably narrated by the British film actress, Carey Mulligan. . . . . . . . . .You can check out this and other reviews on my partner blog: https://crossingthepond.reviews/"
954,5.0,"4.5 starsSylvia Plath ‘Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’Nora is going through a terrible period in her life, where everything that could possibly go wrong, does. She’s consumed with regret over the paths not taken, wrong decisions made. In the throes of depression, she decides suicide is the answer. She has nothing and no one to live for.This is when Nora ends up in the Midnight Library, a sort of limbo between life and death. Part ‘It’s A Wonderful Life’ and part ‘Sliding Doors’, every book in the library represents a parallel universe with a life she could have lived had her choices been different. All she has to do is choose a book and she will automatically be dropped into that life. Each time she is dropped into an alternate life, she does so with no prior memory of her life up to that point. She knows she has been dropped in and must wing it and figure out how to fit in seamlessly. There’s a bit of humor when she must google herself and check her social media accounts for clues. In one life she thinks she must have been very happy because she wasn’t very active on social media (ha).If she loves a life she has a choice to stay. But if she begins to feel disillusioned, she returns to the library, where an infinite number of possibilities awaits. The problem with infinite possibilities is the thought that something better awaits had a different path been chosen.Each decision/life contains unforeseen consequences, some good and some bad. Is the grass always greener? It is easy to imagine there are easier paths, but are there? The problem with regrets is they are rarely based on fact. Understanding the nuances and importance of our lives are not always obvious.I won’t ruin the surprise by revealing more of what Nora discovers or decides. It’s much more fun to discover it on your own. While this book could have been predictable or schmaltzy, the author has written a unique, delightful, and thought-provoking story. There are surprises in store and it’s impossible to read without reflecting on your own life choices. This was a terrific choice for a buddy read with my friend Marialyce, and it would be an excellent choice for a book club.I was grateful for the highlighting function on my kindle, as I highlighted a lot. In the midst of a pandemic and social unrest, it’s natural to worry about the future, but this book was a good reminder to make the best of this life we’ve been given.Knowing the author has struggled with depression and thoughts of suicide made this book all the more meaningful: https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandst...•	Publication date August 13, 2020.

956,5.0,"(Throwback Review) A sojourn of a human to the multiverses through a library, which is as normal as this bizarre world without an exit to trap us there. Nora Seed might seed our mind with melancholy and heart with love in her quest for perfection. Can perfection be attained through the careful movement of the pawns in this deliberate game of life? Through the underlying current of sadness, this literature transcends us to a library between the universes with a librarian who is a mental metaphor that can be fathomed only by a few. “Aisles and aisles of bookshelves, reaching up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad open corridor. Books were everywhere. The shelves really did seem to go on forever, straight and long to the far off horizon. There were no title and names adorning the spines of the books.”  The library between life and death with a vagabond poacher through multiverses, who gave an open invitation to death and didn’t want to be preserved from death as she can’t decide how she wants to live. “You don’t go to death, but the death comes to you”  The fact that the day never ends due to the never-ending light is like living one terminal day. It is exceptionally depressing for an already depressed person who decided to die by traveling with her best companion - solitude from a society so lonely owing to the detachment due to the extreme social media attachment.Does life seem more attractive in the face of death? Is death the one that makes life beautiful? Is death an obligate parasite that wants to change the relationship to a symbiotic one with life?Is the simplification of the three-dimensional worlds by humans making it more complicated? “This is the wrong life. It is really, really, really wrong. Take me back. I do want to avenge. Take me back to the library.In the cosmic order of things, there is no rejection only redirecrtion.”  Can a person cry due to sadness, smile due to the speck of light at the end of the tunnel, and be surprised due to the philosophical brilliance at the same time. The reading experience of this book gives us that unique experience.

 “The thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory.”

No matter what stage in life we’re all at, I feel like everyone can relate to the message of this book. I went into this expecting to read about a girl who somehow gets a chance to live multiple lives in several parallel universes. What I got was a lot more than that. I did not expect to be reflecting on some major life lessons and just basically on the way I look at life. None of us have gone not wishing to be able to live our lives differently, wishing we had made different choices.

""Between life and death there is a library. And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you have made other choices.""
In one word - fascinating!""You see, doing one thing differently is very often the same as doing everything differently. Actions can`t be reversed within a lifetime, however much we try...""I cannot help but compare The Midnight Library with another book Maybe In Another Life, that I have very recently finished reading. I felt that the basic concept in both these books is so similar that TJR might say 'MH, you imitated my idea!'. My response would be that the big difference is The Midnight Library is written with and for a purpose. That's exactly what The Midnight Library is about - `a purpose` to save a life by making the person realise the importance of being alive, understand the infinite possibilities, and guiding towards giving a perspective and not taking things for granted. All this is done by staying serious yet funny, with genuineness and not being casual.The Midnight Library, which can also be named as 'The Many Lives of Nora Seed', explores the many lives of a young woman, Nora Seed, at a time when she has decided to give up her life, and is in fact 'in between life and death'.Matt Haig should consider writing this for the big screen and give it to Christopher Nolan, and Christopher will make a masterpiece out of the script.***`Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small. But every time one decision is taken over another, the outcomes differ. An irreversible variation occurs, which in turn leads to further variations. These books are portals to all the lives you could be living.`"
959,3.0,"3.5 StarsI enjoyed this book, but I feel like I probably should have loved it. And I was, up until the ending, which fell a little flat for me. It just felt...undone, I suppose. But that's also why other readers might really appreciate this ending, and understandably. But anyway. This book was very A Christmas Carol/Groundhog Day/The Family Man-esque. All of which I love - especially The Family Man, which is a 2000 movie featuring Nicolas Cage...TANGENT: I don't know if I've ever mentioned this before, but I love Nicolas Cage. I ADORE Nicolas Cage. Especially 1990's/early 2000 Nicolas Cage. I love all his movies from that period and I will forever be a Nic Cage fangirl. I mean, just look at this Con Air goodness?  Just stop it, Nic Cage, I can't take it. #slayedAnd don't even get me started on Face/Off, The Rock, Leaving Las Vegas, and, City of Angels. Holy shit. #blissDo I ignore the fact that he is basically insane now and makes any movie that will throw money at him? Of course. But who cares. Because I will always have The Croods. But I digress. Let's get back to my super uninformative book review. As I was saying, this book reminded me a lot of The Family Man and all those other movies (and movies/stories like them) that I referenced earlier. It deals with regret and the realization that it's all about perspective. And I really enjoyed that aspect. It's definitely a valuable lesson that has been around for ages, but it's always great to be reminded of it...especially in this age of social media. Constant comparison has never been so in your face...all the time...As I said, if not for the ending, I would have really loved this. I really liked Molly. And while I didn't necessarily need a blatant HEA depicting Molly in the future...I would have at least liked Nora to end up in a place where we knew Molly was probably going to happen. But anyway, that's all I got. I'm off to go re-watch The Family Man for the gazillionth time."
960,1.0,"Are You Serious, Matt?Could it be true that clinical depression arises from bad choices and disappointments; or is it more likely the other way round? Or is it the case that depression is a consequence of environment, one’s less than sane immediate family perhaps; or possibly genetics, an historical aberration passed down from family far distant in space and time? Is the world an objectively depressing place; or made so by our attitude towards it? The philosopher Schopenhauer thought depression was an heroic human condition and promoted it by writing about it; Freud thought it was an illness and tried to cure it by talking about it.Haig thinks depression has something to do with regrets, that is, thoughts about what might have been if we had done things differently. And perhaps he has a point. In his view, regrets occur because of alternative histories we fabricate for ourselves in which disappointment with one’s lot is reduced or eliminated because life would be more fulfilling/successful/happy than the life one actually has. Depression, in other words, is a literary phenomenon. It’s a result of the what-if stories. Imaginative, articulate people, therefore, would be particularly susceptible to the condition. There is in fact substantial anecdotal evidence that this might be so (see, for example, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)Based on this essentially linguistic theory of depression, Haig has a suggestion for therapy. At this point he crosses the line from playful fictional speculation to a less than savoury quackery worthy of Ayn Rand and Tim LaHaye. Haig thinks that some down-to-earth horror stories are just the thing to augment the happily-ever-after alternatives in our heads. Re-write the script, he implies, picking up all the tiny contra-indications of bliss because “undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true.” Or just remember that people, jobs, relationships, and desires change. Perhaps what was the case about these things when the alternative history was written hadn’t persisted. Or the outcomes remain the same despite different choices. Haig’s point, I suppose, is that things could be worse; that maybe Leibniz had it right: this world could be the best of all possible worlds. Disappointment with one’s regrets as a cure for regrets, and therefore a therapy for disabling, suicidal depression? Things could be worse!? That’s your therapeutic message? Are you serious, Matt?Haig even makes a pitch for a sort of group therapy in which those formulating alternatives to the alternatives get together for solace and encouragement. And of course he feels compelled to bring in quantum mechanics to bolster the non-literary reality of simultaneous lives - a cliché I was mightily hoping he might avoid. And the allusion to YHWH as the master of ceremonies (very Leibnizian), in the guise of a benevolent librarian, keeping all the disparate quantum selves in line is pretty cheesy. Ultimately Haig opts for the cheesiest of all criterion for the story one must have about one’s life: authenticity, we must be our realest, bestest, truest self. “Aim to be the truest version of you,” the godly librarian suggests, as if a depressive has a choice in the matter. I think Haig may have been to one too many EST seminars, or at least spent too much time in Southern California reading Heidegger on the beach.Of course in creating these new personal stories another issue eventually arises if one’s authentic self is the depressed wreck one started with. Then “It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from,” says Haig’s protagonist, brought back from the brink of suicidal death. But the important point, according to Haig, is “You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed.” Can one help thinking of Eric Idle’s magnificent rendition of ‘Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life’ in the Life Of Brian? Did I mention cheesy.I think it clear that The Midnight Library is a grave insult to those suffering from depression. It is a facile, trivial, misdirected, and (did I mention?) cheesy book. Am I entirely off-base in thinking Haig wrote it as a feel-good piece for those who just need a little pat on the back for their recovery from a bout of the blues, or a failed love affair? If not, you’re a louse, Matt."
961,3.0,"Be sure to visit Bantering Books to read all my latest reviews.3.5 starsI didn’t love The Midnight Library. And no one is more surprised by this than me. For the simple reason that Matt Haig’s bestselling novel is a sensation. It has been embraced by thousands of readers, many of whom cherish it.I thought it would be a slam-dunk read for me. It should’ve been a slam-dunk read. Because the story has so much of what I enjoy – a magical library, clever writing, a cat.What’s not to love? Right?Unfortunately, I can think of a few things.Nora Seed has hit a rough patch. Feeling saddened by her life choices, she enters the Midnight Library – a library housed between life and death, where there are endless shelves filled with an infinite number of books, each one containing a slight variation of Nora’s current life.By simply opening a book, Nora is transported to an alternate reality, and she is able to see how she would have turned out had she only made a different decision. Would she have been happy as a glaciologist? Or a singer in a band? Or if she had married? Or pursued Olympic swimming?Presented with the opportunity to undo her past mistakes, Nora must decide for herself which of her many, many possible lives is the one most worth living.I can certainly see why The Midnight Library has resonated with so many readers. It’s a story about regret, which is a theme to which every single one of us can likely relate. I’m sure we all regret something that we did or didn’t do and have therefore felt, at one time or another, the pain and heft of regret’s burden.But for all of its relatability, the novel is also quite dark, with the story being centered around suicide and depression – two subject matters that some readers may find to be disturbing and triggering. (Consider yourself forewarned.)To Haig’s credit, however, he neither delves too deeply, nor too heavily into the topics. He keeps the story fairly close to the surface, only dipping his toe in just enough to give the reader sufficient character insight. In addition, the tone of Haig’s writing is warm and gentle, and he does an excellent job of inserting light moments of humor into the narrative to counteract its bleakness.And Haig also adds a touch of bright, magical fantasy to the story by creating the wondrous Midnight Library – only to then swiftly explain away and bury that magic beneath theories of physics and philosophy.Boring theories of physics and philosophy, I should say. And this is part of the reason why The Midnight Library did not enamor me.By taking away the magic of the story and replacing it with science fiction, the story is bogged down and often difficult to wrap one’s head around, giving it a bit of a textbook feel. I had to fight hard to keep my interest and focus intact.And not only is the novel too laden with science fiction for my tastes, but after a while, it also begins to feel less like a story and more like one big, inspirational pep talk. A heavy-handed, in-your-face pep talk. Haig slings life lesson after life lesson at the reader, self-improvement message after self-improvement message, with zero subtlety. He gives us no space to draw our own conclusions and interpretations. He does not trust us to correctly connect all the dots.For me, Haig’s lack of faith in the reader is what finally does the novel in. By S-P-E-L-L-I-N-G everything out, he noticeably weakens the impact of The Midnight Library. What could have been an exceptionally powerful and emotional read, instead falls flat. Clearly, my opinion lies in the minority. And by no means is it my intention to discourage anyone from reading this well-received novel. Many of you will respond to it far differently than I did. So, here is my wish for those who read it – May you love it. May you treasure it. May you find within the pages of The Midnight Library all the magic you hope to find.And all that I did not.

962,4.0,"This is an enjoyable book, it’s my first by Matt Haig, but it won’t be my last. It’s a book about recognizing all the possibilities of your life, but it’s more about letting go the regrets of what you could have been. Nora Seed is miserable, miserable enough to be not only thinking about suicide, but acting on it. Instead of the blackness of death, she awakes in the Midnight Library accompanied by her Elementary School librarian, Mrs. Elm. Mrs. Elm explains that the library is filled with books that represent all the possibilities of her life, an infinite number of paths, created by an infinite number of choices. When she chooses a book, she will be transported into the life, and can live it until she decides if it’s a life she would want to continue.Haig writing is strong; clever, clean, and no distractions. The book is full of great observations and insights.“A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”We get deep into Nora’s character and she felt genuine in her struggles to me. If anything bothered me about her character it was how talented she was. How many people have the talent to be Rockstar, an Olympic Swimmer, a successful Ted Talk speaker, etc. etc. However, I can forgive this, as it serves to drive home the central theme of the book.My bigger problem is the mechanism that allows Nora to revisit her past, a suicide attempt. Largely, Haig handles this delicate subject well. I appreciate authors that take on subjects as challenging as suicide, but it's dangerous to have the suicide attempt itself be the mechanism that triggers a chance to relive your life. Why? Because somewhere out there, someone is struggling so hard, that have such regrets, that they will talk themselves into believing anything. I enjoy Time Travel books and I follow a number of Facebook groups dedicated to this subject. In those groups I have found that there are a concerning number of people that have such anguish over a past decision or choice that they want desperately to believe that time travel is possible. They beg, plead, and even offer money for people to reveal the secrets that will allow them to travel to their past to change their past choices. If someone is suicidal, any idea that suicide itself might provide a chance to relive their life is unsafe. Suicide is never the answer and only wastes the potential of a valuable life. So while I applaud Haig for taking on this important subject, I just wish the method that triggered the journey to the Midnight Library were different; a magic potion, a freak accident, a visit by an angel, anything but a suicide attempt.A well-written parable of one women’s journey to move beyond her regrets and find meaning in her life through a supernatural library that’s filled with books that represent all her possible lives."
963,5.0,"In The Midnight Library, Matt Haig combines subjects I love in books: life and death concerns, regrets, love, complicated relationships, family... and, of course, there's a library!I really like how Haig achieves to write what I consider being self-help books with magic and a good storyline. If you liked The Midnight Library, you should definitely take a look at How to Stop Time.The premise of The Midnight Library wasn't new to me. A couple years ago, there was a canadian tv show called Being Erica. It wasn't well-known nor very popular, but I personally watched each season more than once. It's the story of a woman who travels in the past to erase her regrets. Ring a bell? When I learned that Matt Haig was publishing a book with a similar premise, I was overjoyed!I can't say this book is perfect, but it deserves 5 stars because, well, it is almost perfect."

965,5.0,"Wow, Matt Haig's newest novel, 
The Midnight Library
, was absolutely beautiful.“...sometimes the only way to learn is to live.”Nora has decided she wants to die. She’s just so unhappy and doesn’t feel like she or her life matter to anyone. She's disappointed everyone in her life, and she doesn’t think her death will have an impact.She finds herself in The Midnight Library, which is filled with books that each contains a life Nora could have lived had she made a different choice or picked a different path. Some books even contain lives she never imagined.With the help of an old friend, Nora explores the options the library offers her. But sometimes the choices aren’t easy to make, and sometimes a decision has ramifications she could never fathom. Ultimately, she needs to understand what living a life really means, and whether it’s worth fighting for, before the choices she makes or doesn’t make doom the library—and her—forever.I loved this book so much. Matt Haig is an amazing writer (I also loved his 
How to Stop Time

967,4.0,"Nora Seed is a young woman who is suffering from depression.Her job at a music store has ended,, her cat died..her personal relationships with family are not the best.. and she tries to end her life.Well, instead of her life ending.. she ends up in The Midnight Library where she chooses books that take her to different lives, parallel lives she may have lived...in these lives she is many different things.. there is a Nora who became a rock star, another who has won Olympic medals, another living aboard an Arctic research vessel; some versions are mothers, wives... if she finds a good life, she can stay.I enjoyed this story of learning what is important in life!"

Librarians like poems.” And the she quoted Robert Frost. “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I - / I took the only less travelled by, / And that has made all the difference...””Nora Seed is at a loss. She’s recently single, gets fired from her job, isn’t close to her brother...the list goes on and on. She’s mentally and physically exhausted with life, and decides to kill herself......Yet she wakes up in The Midnight Library, a place between life and death. She gets chance after chance to find the life that was meant for her and face her regrets by opening a book that is handed to her from the shelf, with varying results. Will she find the will to live again? Or is it too late for her?There are many things I give kudos to. Depression is not a joke, and author Matt Haig tackles it head-on in the beginning. As Nora goes through various scenarios, each layer of her existence is peeled back like an onion. It becomes more clear what made her so unhappy in life, but also what was out of her control...and what she shouldn’t feel guilty for.There are scenarios that I feel could have been expanded upon, and others that could’ve been skipped. At the end of the day, I enjoyed this fictional story, but hoped there would’ve been a bit more behind it. I never got the feels that I was expecting. I cared about Nora and wanted her to be content, but the impact of her story wavered for me. I DID love the very fitting chapter names. My favorite?

969,5.0,"Loved it! I can't give it anything less than 5 stars. I'm quite stingy too with the 5 stars and one of the key factors for me is would I read this book again? Totally! I went into it a little blind and was rewarded with such a wonderful, thought provoking book.The Midnight Library tells the story of Nora Seed. She appears to be at a cross roads in her life. Her cat has just died, she lost her job, and just doesn't have anyone in her life, no family. She has given up and begins the countdown to her death which she is planning via suicide. What she is not planning is ending up in The Midnight Library, where each book represents a life she could have lived if she made different choices in her life. Her guide book, almost, is her book of regrets, all the regrets that she had her life. She begins to select books in the library, going to that life she could have lived if she made different choices, and you see all the possibilities. But in each of these lives, does she truly find the happiness that she is looking for?I can't do this one justice. I loved the story, loved the audio (narrated by Cary Mulligan), loved the character. It was a buddy read with Dana and we both really enjoyed it and were so happy with the audio narration. This book brought on some great discussions plus some soul searching and thinking about life. Some time ago I downloaded a copy of this book from Edelweiss, forgetting that I had it. I'm glad I procrastinated on the print as it really was a top audio narration for the year for me as well. Overall, so happy to read this one and I look forward to more from this author."
970,4.0," “Between life and death there is a library. And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices...would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets.”  This book hits differently. Got me thinking about my regrets and different lives 😭Nora is severely depressed and in a very bad place emotionally. After the death of her cat and losing her job it is the final straw for her and she attempts suicide. She then finds herself in The Midnight Library. A place between life and death where you can view other lives you could have lived had you made different choices. There are an infinite number of lives where even the smallest decision can have a massive impact. A lot like The Butterfly Effect. I found the physics side of it to go over my head a lot, but I enjoyed following Nora into the different lives and different things that could have happened to her. It’s pretty dark in places, there is a strong emphasis on mental and emotional well-being and what that means. Also our regrets are often unfounded. Our ‘perfect’ life had we made different choices is most likely not perfect at all. A quick read that hit me pretty hard. ***************************Copy lent to me by a friend 😊💖Excited for this one!"

972,4.0,"Living in a damp squalid flat, alone, tired, adrift Nora's life takes yet another downturn pushing her over the edge, but at the strike of midnight on the cusp of possible death, she finds herself in The Midnight Library with an infinite number of books - each book representing a different choice, a different path her life would have taken. With the opportunity to live an infinite number of Nora realities, how can she chose the best life?What a book! A superb and engrossing concept, where different decisions have Nora's life taking so many different paths, but paths that also impact on the people in her life. Haig's writes about a pretty key philosophical question in a very engaging and accessible manner. As I read this book, I couldn't but help not only wonder about my own life, but also truly engage in some of the real scientific theory that this book's concept is built on.Although far and away the best Matt Haig book I've read, and built around a fabulous premise and concepts, I do feel that there could have been a lot more done with both the story and the realities that our protagonist lives. Still a very good Four Star 9 out of 12 after all this one of those books that almost every book nerd will cherish reading!2021 read"
974,2.0,"Thanks to Canongate and NetGalley for the Advance Review Copy in exchange for an honest review.What if you could change the past? Take all those nasty regrets and make a different choice? Nora, the main character of this novel is given that chance to remake some of her past decisions. I really like Matt Haig. He seems like an all round top bloke. Up till now I hadn't read any of his books but I'd heard about this one some months ago and the premise sounded intriguing.I felt like this book read like one of those eastern philosophical tales where characters exist to make some kind of profound point. It felt like lots of key messages from a self help book were couched within the story which considering self help books are basically kryptonite to me didn't really endear me to it.One of the consequences of this approach was that the characters didn't really have much depth. They just existed to make some kind of point and then buggered off. It was also completely obvious what the ultimate outcome of Nora's story was going to be. It was just a bit fat meh for me. Rather than feeling uplifted, I just felt irritated and a little bit patronised."
975,5.0,"More than worthy Goodreads Choice award winner!Wow. This book. This was the book to read late in December of 2020. The Midnight Library brought peace, joy, and self-reflection at a time when I really needed it AND when I had the time to thoroughly process it all. Even with me taking my time with it, I read this book in two quick sittings. Matt Haig’s writing is smooth as butter, and Nora Seed’s story is one I could definitely relate to in different ways.I’m not summarizing the synopsis for this one as I normally would because I think it’s important to go into this book with fresh eyes and no preconceptions. Just know I highlighted this book out the wazoo, and I never tire of sliding door type stories infused with hope. The Midnight Library receives my highest of accolades; when I was finished with Nora’s story, I gave the book a huge hug and immediately bought two more of Matt Haig’s books. Love love love.I received a gifted copy.Many of my reviews can also be found on my blog: www.jennifertarheelreader.com and instagram: www.instagram.com/tarheelreader"

“The only way to learn is to live.”
trigger warnings: suicide, mention of self-harm, death of an animal, mention of animal torture.Possible spoilers during the review. You've been warned.I'm gonna tell y'all a story. We used to have a large circular can of cookies, the traditional American can, blue with the picture of a farm or who knows what actually is. So, I picked up the can and I opened, thinking that was filled with cookies... Instead of it, there were needles and wool buns. Latinos know about this kind of disappointment.This was this book for me. A big ass disappointment.The synopsis of this book was promising, full of excitement and hyped. The hype of The Midnight Library was incredibly huge. I liked the synopsis and said: ""yes, this may be worthwhile"". But I'm naive, friends. I never learn from my past mistakes.So, Nora Seed is a depressed woman who thinks her life is meaningless. She was fired from her job, her cat died, she has many regrets in her life (family, friends, love, job, ec.) that she can't stand it anymore. The final straw is when her cat dies, she realizes that there is no point in living anymore. So, she kills herself drinking a lot of pills.When Nora wakes up, she's in a library. But she seems to be alone, until she finds Mrs. Elm, the librarian of Nora's school who was kind with her. This woman offers to Nora the possibility to know the lives Nora could've lived if she had made different decisions. And so, Nora starts her journey. Long story short: Nora realizes that she doesn't wanna die. That some of her lives are not the way she wanted, that are disappointing, boring or don't make her happy.Honestly, if I had the chance to try other lives that I could've lived if I hadn't regretted many things, I would totally say yes. Because, let's face it: it would be amazing to know the things we could have done different. So, perhaps in another life, I would have studied medicine, or modern languages (English and French), or History, or made excercise, or talked more with the girl that I liked, or if I had saved more money, or if I had obtained better grades, or if in another life, I would be your girl...Just kidding.But, that's not gonna happen. I have this life because I made some decisions (and I regret all of them, but still, here am I). Because we all made decisions that brought us all to where we are. We could be happy in another life? Who knows. We could be miserable, just like Nora when she lived the life where she married Dan. I gotta say that I wasn't surprised for the ""plots"" in this book. I saw coming many many many things in here. The writing was pretty, I'm not gonna lie because it was kind of deep. There were many philosophical quotes and thoughts and references that were pretty deep and confusing at the same.Some characters were flat, boring and simply; they contributed nothing to the plot or to the MC. Nora has some deeper and worryign depression. I suffer of depression, but I've never made it to that point, so I can't say much about it. I didn't relate with her or get attached with her either or the side characters at all. I just didn't care for her, or get related or even attached. Please, don't stone me for this; I'm being totally honest.Dylan was ok and sweet but I hated the comparison to a dog that Nora made of him. Ash was someone gentle, nerd and also sweet, but honestly we never get to know them very well. They're part of some of Nora's lives, but they're not relevant at all. Just like her parents, her brother, her ex fianceé, her best friend, yada, yada, yada... She made some decisions / or didn't for them, and lived some lives without those decisions (trust me, I got confused too at some point) that she didn't enjoy at all. Nora also met another traveler just like her, Hugo, but he called them ""slidders"", I don't remember very well.At some point, Nora finds out that none of those lives are really satisfying, and therefore, she was back in the Midnight Library, in which, time is frozen at 00:00:00, because she was and wasn't dead. Nora discovers that many of the decisions that she made or didn't made were ok... And when she thought she found the perfect life it turns out that she finds she's living a lie, she's faking and pretending to be a mother, a wife and a good person, having a good and perfect life.Long story short, the library is falling apart and Nora must to write in the only book in blank. So, she gets back to life, but in her root life, she was dying, so she asked for help. She learned the lesson and decides to live her life.This is a self-help book. Not that is wrong tho. No, I'm not meaning that... It's just that I was waiting 
more
. I was expecting more from an overhyped book, which I've seen many 4/5 stars rant (note: if you liked it, good for you, because I tried so hard) and sometimes I wonder if I'm not a heartless and cold bitch lmao.Anyhow, this book isn't bad. Perhaps my most depressed 17-year-old self would've enjoyed this with more passion and even shed tears like a bitch. Because, trust me, this is the kind of book that 17 yo me would've needed and really yearned. I had and have many dark times, folks, that's why I picked up this book in first place, but, my dark moments are anecdotes for another day.It was bittersweet to me. The ending was rushed and cheesy? I can't even find the word to describe how it made me feel.I do like the message that this book is telling. I really really do. I just learned something: please don't consider suicide as the solution to all of your problems. Believe me, I've been there, a lot of times, but that's not the answer to anything. This is an advice from someone who has suffered from depression since 13: you are not alone, you are important, you matter. Please, talk to someone and get help. You may thing it doesn't help, that it can't make a difference, but it does. We all have our regrets, but we also have our succeses: those little victories that you achieve every day, even if you don't notice it.Anyhow, this is my review and if you liked/loved this book, I'm so so so glad for you, because I wish that would be me.I'm sad that this books goes straight to my ""big hype big lie"" shelf. :/_________________________________________buddy read lia, katie, mel, juls, lucia, sofia, lacey, ish, tisha, ayla_________________________________________i've read mixed reviews and now idk what to think, please just don't let me down *fingers crossed*"
977,4.0,"Trigger warning: This book can provoke suicidal thoughts.Midnight Library is a beautiful book. From the very first page until the end, with beautiful writing, it pulls you in and you just want to enjoy every minute of your reading experience.I loved the originality and I often wondered where the author found the inspiration for this book.It is hopeful but also disappointing at the same time. When I say it's hopeful I mean how it shows us how often regrets are something we carry with us even though we often are not guilty as we think we are.When I say it's disappointing I think about how it show us how we can do all the right decisions, make right moves, and still be unhappy and unfulfilled.As someone who is suicidal, I want to mention that this book can provoke suicidal thoughts. I know I had them while reading it.The idea of a Midnight Library as a real thing looked appealing to me, so I wanted to mention that.The reason why this novel got only 4 stars for me is that I wish it had an epilogue. I think with an epilogue it would be more... complete."
978,2.0,"*** Long review incoming: if you want to get to my biggest problem with this book, please skip to the “Ugly” section.*** Upon initially finishing this book, I generously rated it three stars mostly because of the impactful subject matter, but the longer I sit with my thoughts, the more clear it becomes to me that I didn’t like this book. I realize that I’m in the vast minority with that opinion, and I’m truly happy for all the people who loved and found support in this book, but I also feel like I there are some things that need to be said contrary to all the praise. First things first: we start our story with Nora, a young woman on the day she decides to die. Having been recently fired and having lost her cat, best friend and contact with her brother, she feels so hopeless about life that she attempts suicide. To her surprise, she finds herself waking up in a library: the library between worlds. Here, every book contains an alternative version of her life, had she made different decisions, giving her a glimpse into what might have been, but also offering her a second chance of that life. There’s only one condition: she can only stay in that life, if she’s completely happy with it.The Good: I like Matt Haigs narrative voice. I like how accessible he made these very difficult topic in this novel, and the way he streamlined this novel. This is the kind of story that only needs a single plotline, and I’m happy that Haig focussed on that, instead of adding in unnecessary subplots that would have taken away from the primary one. Honestly, the rest of the novel just wasn’t  good to me. It was just  okay. Safe. Bland. And one that has been done time and time again in different forms of media in just this exact way. The Bad: I’m trying to keep this short, so we can get to the real heart of the problem sooner: -	Unoriginal/predictable/bland I’ve read/watched/heard this story a million times before, and I based on the synopsis I could have written it out beat for beat for you, and I would have been 100% correct. Matt Haig does nothing original or impactful with this trope. -	“Nothing matters”The majority of this book focusses on Nora living through her alternative lives. Unfortunately, as we known how many pages we have left (and probably how this book will end), we know none of them will stick. Therefore none of what she does during these sections matters. Nora as a character also completely lacks any agency: she wants to be ""happy"", but has no concrete image of what that would be or how to achieve it, making it hard to identify with her as our ""heroine."" -	SentimentalSeriously, this book is basically actively wrenching the tears from your eyes. It tries so hard to be profound and emotional that it fell completely flat for me. The emotional beats were very “engineered”: I could practically hear the sad piano music swell as the important paragraphs arose. It’s so cheap and reminds me of the problem I have with “sick-lit”: using the suffering of a character with an illness to get cheap emotion out of an audience of able-bodied people. The Ugly: When covering this type of subject matter, you know your book is going to be influential to readers who identify with it. For that reason, you have to get this right, which is why I’m extra critical of these stories. The margin of error is tiny, and well meant advise can in fact be harmful to the wrong person at the wrong time. *SPOILER ALERT* I guess, although if you haven’t figured out the direction this book would take by now, you clearly haven’t seen as many movies/books with these themes as I have. In the end, Nora discovers that her original life (the one she wanted to escape so badly), was her best life after all. Despite the challenges she faces, the learns to see all the good in her original life and decides to return to it. The message of “just don’t be sad and look at all the good you have” is not one that is helpful with people suffering from true depression or suicidal ideations. It’s also a very (for lack of a better term) “privileged” stance to take. Yes, Nora’s life has a lot of good: she has friends, parents, a brother, a roof over her head, money, good health, opportunities… So many people who are in a low enough place to contemplate suicide do not have many or even any of these things. Not to mention, for someone suffering from depression, none of this will matter to their well-being. Depression is an illness, NOT a choice. “Just focus on the good” is a cheap and easy cop-out, and an insult to a large portion of the people this book pretends address."

She goes to bed after drinking wine and swallowing pills one night, and finds herself in The Midnight Library, a place in between life and death. Here, Nora gets to answer the famous “What if?” and experiences numerous other paths for her life — Are they better? Is she happier? More fulfilled? I liked The Midnight Library — I wasn’t quite as enamored with it or blown away as I thought I might be (based on the surrounding hype), but it was definitely a good story and worth reading. I think it would make a good movie too. I felt for Nora at times — We’ve all been letdown by others or ourselves and likely wondered how one decision shifts life, changing everything. The Midnight Library is a thought-provoking story with the reminder: the time is now."
981,4.0,"The Midnight Library, Matt HaigSomewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?In The Midnight Library, Matt Haig's enchanting blockbuster novel, Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز دوم ماه سپتامبر سال 2021میلادیعنوان: کتابخانه نیمه شب؛ نویسنده: مت هیگ؛ مترجم: نوشین تاجیک؛ سبزوار، یوبان؛ 1399، در 441ص؛ شابک 9786008349730؛ موضوع داستانهای نویسندگان بریتانیا - سده 20معنوان: کتابخانه نیمه شب؛ نویسنده: مت هیگ؛ مترجم: مهسا صباغی؛ تهران، آذرباد، 1399؛ در 370ص؛ شابک 9786227314236؛ عنوان: کتابخانه نیمه شب؛ نویسنده: مت هیگ؛ مترجم: نیما مانی؛ تهران، البرز، 1400، در 287ص؛ شابک 9786222352004؛ عنوان: کتابخانه نیمه شب؛ نویسنده: مت هیگ؛ مترجم: محمدصالح نورانی‌زاده؛ تهران، کوله پشتی، 1400؛ در 351ص، شابک 9786004614610؛ چاپ دوم تا ششم 1400؛عنوان: کتابخانه نیمه شب؛ نویسنده: مت هیگ؛ مترجم: امین حسینیون؛ تهران، ثالث، 1400؛ در 448ص؛ شابک 9786004056663؛عنوان: کتابخانه نیمه شب؛ نویسنده: مت هیگ؛ مترجم: سما معیری؛ تهران، برج، 1400؛ در 312ص، شابک 9786227280586؛عنوان: کتابخانه نیمه شب؛ نویسنده: مت هیگ؛ مترجم: گیتا گرکانی؛ تهران، سده، 1400؛ در 362ص؛ شابک 9786008968559؛عنوان: کتابخانه نیمه شب؛ نویسنده: مت هیگ؛ مترجم: مهسا قنبری؛ تهران، ترنگ، 1400؛ در 380ص؛ شابک 9786227741018؛در نظر بگیرید جایی باشد که فرصت تجربه‌ ی دوباره‌ ی زندگی را به انسان بدهد، همین که بتوانیم بیشتر از یک‌بار زندگی کنیم، وسوسه انگیز و خیالمان آسوده می‌شود، که راه‌های نرفته ی خویش را میتوانیم برویم؛ در کتاب «کتابخانه‌ نیمه شب» با این پرسش از خود رودررو هستیم، که اگر فرصت برای دوباره زندگی کردن را داشته باشیم، چه چیزهایی را میتوانستیم دگرگون کنیم و پیامدهای آن دگرگونیها چه چیزهایی خواهند بود؟ آیا ما آماده‌ ی آن تغییرات هستیم؟ و یا اصلا به پیامد آن‌ها اندیشیده ایم؟در این کتاب، پرسوناژ نخست، جوانی سی و پنجساله ساله، به نام «نورا» است، که از زندگی و ناامیدی‌های خویش خسته شده، و میخواهد به زندگی خویش پایان دهد، زندگی «نورا» پر از ناراحتی، ناامیدی و حسرت بوده است؛ او انگیزه‌ ای برای ادامه دادن به زندگی در خود نمی‌بیند، اما در جایی بین زندگی و مرگ، «نورا» راهی کتابخانه‌ ی زندگی خود می‌شود؛ از این‌جای کتاب، «مت هیگ» خوانشگر را به دنیای خیالی و فلسفی می‌برند، و قرار است با واقعیتی روبرو شوید که توان نگرش دقیق‌تر به معنی زندگی را به خوانشگران می‌دهددر کتابخانه به تعداد همگی اشخاصی که در کره‌ ی زمین زندگی می‌کنند، کتاب وجود دارد، و هر کس کتابخانه‌ ی زندگی ویژه ی خودش را دارد (همانند گودریدز)، در کتاب «کتابخانه‌ ی نیمه شب» با «نورا» به کتابخانه‌ ی زندگی ایشان می‌رویم؛ دربان کتابخانه که بانویی پیر هست، درب کتابخانه‌ ی «نورا» را برایش باز می‌کنند، تا او بتواند همگی کتاب‌های زندگی‌ خویش را ورق بزند؛ در این کتاب‌ها که همگی گزینشهای «نورا»، برای زندگی‌اش نگاشته شده؛ نوشته اند اگر او هر مسیری را برمیگزید، در آینده چه رویدادی برایش رخ می‌داد، و نتیجه‌ ی گزینشش چه چیزی به همراه خویش می‌آورد؛ کارهای ناتمامش را اگر تمام می‌کرد، آیا موفقتر می‌بود؟؛ مواجهه عجیب انسان با کارهای کرده و نکرده، و پیامدهایش می‌توانند هم لذت‌بخش، و هم ترسناک باشندنورا آنقدر از زندگی ناامید بوده، که تصمیم به پایان بخشیدن به آن گرفته بود، و حالا در کتابخانه‌ ای حضور دارد، که میتواند بارها و بارها فرصت‌های زندگیش را دوباره زندگی کند؛ تصمیم «نورا» چه خواهد بود؟ با این فرصت تکرار نشدنی چه خواهد کرد؟ آیا گزینشهای درستی خواهد داشت؟ برای پاسخ به این پرسشها، و اینکه خودتان را نیز همانند «نورا» در «کتابخانه‌ ی نیمه شب» زندگی خویش قرار دهید، باید همراه «نورا» راهی این سفر خیالی و فلسفی گردید؛نقل از متن: (احساس دلپذیری داشت؛ هم بوسه و هم دانستن اینکه می‌تواند تا این حد جسور باشد؛ دانستن اینکه هر آنچه ممکن بود برایش اتفاق بیفتد، جایی و در زندگی دیگری اتفاق افتاده است؛ اندکی خیالش را بابت تصمیم‌گیری راحت کرد؛ این فقط حقیقت تابع موج جهانی بود؛ نتیجه گرفت هر تصمیمی که بگیرد، ممکن است توسط فیزیک کوانتوم، بی‌اثر شود؛ «هوگو» گفت: «من هم اتاقی ندارم.»؛ «نورا» بدون ترس به او خیره شد؛ دیدن خرس قطبی به او جرئتی داده بود، که هرگز در خود سراغ نداشت، «خب هوگو، شاید تو بتونی طلسم رو بشکنی»؛ اما عشق آمیزی ناامید کننده بود؛ درست در وسط آن جمله ای از «آلبر کامو» برایش تداعی شد؛ شاید از اینکه به چه چیزی علاقه دارم مطمئن نباشم، اما هميشه مطمئن بودم به چه چیزی علاقه ندارم، احتمالا اینکه داشت در مورد فلسفه «اگزیستانسیالیسم» فکر میکرد، نشانه ی خوبی در مورد کیفیت ملاقات شبانه‌ شان نبود، مخصوصاً که این جمله خاص به ذهنش خطور کرده بود؛ «کامو» همچنین گفته بود: «اگه اتفاقی برای من رخ بدهد؛ آیا تمایل دارم آنجا باشم؟»؛ «نورا» نتیجه گرفت «کامو» آدم عجیبی بوده است؛ به عنوان مردی که بسیار صمیمی بود، و صحبتهای عمیقی می‌کرد، و حضور خوبی در لحظه نداشت؛ شاید اگر انسان زندگی‌های فراوانی را تجربه کند، تنها کسی که واقعا با آن رابطه‌ ی نزدیک دارد، خودش است؛ «نورا» احساس کرد شاید خودش هم در آنجا حضور ندارد؛ چند ثاتیه بعد واقعا آنجا نبود)؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 13/06/1400هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"

’Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’ 
For a brief moment, as this story begins, a young Nora Seed is sitting in the small library at her school, her school librarian, Mrs. Elm, is playing a game of chess with Nora, and while Nora is intently staring at the chess board, Mrs. Elm shares a bit of wisdom with young Nora, saying ‘...you could be anything you want to be, Nora. Think of all that possibility. It’s exciting.’Nineteen years later, Nora is sitting on her sofa, when a man she recognizes, but doesn’t really know well, rings her doorbell, reluctantly, in order to deliver bad news to her. She makes a decision that will, ultimately, she can no longer go on, and tries to commit suicide, but ends up in a library which offers her a choice - to return to live, to choose from a seemingly endless selection of books - lives, to which she may enter a new variation of her own life. Serving as the librarian of this library of life choices is her old school librarian, Mrs. Elm, who gently guides her in understanding how this all works. Asking questions, Mrs. Elm helps Nora find the various paths that she might have chosen in another life. One by one, she experiences the various other paths she might have chosen, tackling decisions that she has often regretted, or wondered if her life might have turned out to offer a more fulfilling, happier life.  A wonderful diversion for me from these crazy, stress-filled days.Many thanks, once again, to the Public Library system, and the many Librarians that manage, organize and keep it running, for the loan of this book!"
983,5.0,"I love this author and his amazing imagination! I have not read a bad or even an average book by him yet.The Midnight Library is the story of Norah Seed who finally decides that life is not worth living and attempts suicide. She finds herself in a library entirely made up of alternate lives she could have lived, and the possibility of trying some of them out. Along the way she learns a lot about herself, relationships, and the value of life itself. I would say that the book starts off a little depressing, is entertaining in the middle and is enlightening at the end. I absolutely loved the fact that it was set in Bedford in England. My first ever job was as a Library Assistant at Bedford Library. I promise you that the town is not as boring as Haig describes, and it doesn't rain there any more than any other place in the UK.Anyway, another great book from this clever author and I must get around to reading more of his backlist."
984,4.0,"3.5 stars, rounded upI’ve always had a thing for stories about parallel lives. Life after Life, The Book of Two Ways and Dark Matter are three books on the subject that spring to mind. I love how a different choice could lead to such a different life. What if I had married that man? Or decided to take a different job? Majored in a different subject in college? What would I do if I had a chance to undo the things I regret? This is the plot behind The Midnight Library. Nora commits suicide. Upon the cessation of life, she finds herself in a library with book upon book, all based on how her life would have turned out if she had made one different decision. By opening the book, she gets a chance to live that life. It’s an engaging story, as we see Nora placed into the life she would have been living if she had just made these different decisions. The interesting thing is she is truly just placed in that life. She doesn’t have the “background” she would have if she’d been living that life the entire time. While it hits some deep topics, the book is fairly obvious and simplistic. The points Haig is making don’t take a philosophy degree to figure out. No life is perfect, there will always be regrets. But credit where credit is due, I still wanted to see how all of Nora’s lives would play out. It’s a fun listen, if not a deep one. This would probably make a decent book club selection. Carey Mulligan was fabulous as the narrator."
985,5.0,"The Midnight Library is the perfect prescription for the malady of regret. It is also my favorite fiction read of 2020. And right up there with ""all time"" status for me.The premise is beautiful, yet simple. A woman suffering from depression is transported to a magical, infinite library where each book contains a life she didn't live due to choices she made along the way. What would her life have been had she not given up swimming? Or had she gone ahead with marrying her jilted fiance? Or not broken up her band? Sure, the woulda/coulda/shoulda plot device is one we've all seen before in stories like A Christmas Carol, It's a Wonderful Life, and Sliding Doors. Yet Matt Haig is such an honest, skilled writer that this novel seems fresh... and even necessary. Enhancing my experience was Carey Mulligan's pitch-perfect narration of the audiobook. Ms. Mulligan, please narrate ALL the books!I will think back on The Midnight Library often and will likely gift it to friends suffering from unfortunate bouts of self loathing or despair. It's a hug and earnest pep talk that would beat a cookie bouquet or scented candle any day. Thank you, Matt Haig, for finding these words and putting them to paper."

""The only way to learn is to live.""
This is one of those books you open and simply know where the author wishes to take you but the journey is so intrinsically beautiful that you simply follow him around these winding paths through a forest of possibility and find yourself smiling at the gems you gather along the way. I don't believe that this is a book you tire from, you simply cannot because it is not just one book, it is an amalgamation of hundreds of lives, lives you are already familiar with because you've seen them play out in front of your eyes, you've read about them, you've even lived a few of them, and when laid out in front of your eyes, You greet each life with recognition and understanding and yet you are still=excited to find out how differently happiness and sorrow have been balanced in yet another possibility in a world thriving on potential.It takes skill to be able to show the reader the very feel of each world, each life Nora lives in just a chapter or two, and yet Matt Haig sees it done fantastically choosing moments that range from utter chaos to utter peace and along the way you recognize that the theoretically choatic ones were those which were straightforward, calm even, and the peaceful ones were the most tumultuous. I think everyone should pick this book up at some point in their lives. Enriched with mesmerizing, engaging writing and a story that does this out-of-the-world concept justice, Matt Haig accomplishes what you can, clearly, see he set out to do.

989,4.0,"“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.”There’s a great deal to talk about here……..If we think about the power of words, the power they have to move us and make us think and imagine, then The Midnight Library is a very powerful book indeed. Each book in the library offers a glimpse into an alternative reality, an alternative life we could have lived if we had made different decisions. How cool is that? But if you’ve ever felt suicidal, depressed or like you’re not living the life you are “supposed” to be living, then this might be a very hard read because it makes us consider alternatives and the importance of small choices. We could quite easily be living a different life based upon a very small action. There’s something terribly consuming about regret, and if we’re not careful it can take over as we wonder where we could be. So tread lightly because there’s a lot of emotional triggers here even if the book has a understandably positive outcome. Matt Haig is not subtle. This isn’t a book that’s going to leave you guessing or wondering what it’s all about: his message is very clear. Regret is pointless. Just because we are not what we might be (or we are not living as we could be) it doesn’t mean we will be happy or fulfilled. Every life is filled with problems. To invoke a cliché: the grass is not always greener on the other side. And this is important to remember. There are many paths we might take and they can lead us anywhere. The key here is to move forward the best we can and to remember that life is always worth living because there will always be new opportunities. Matt Haig is a self-help author, naturally much of his positive rhetoric appears in this novel. It’s his novel. It’s to be expected. And as such the ending was expected. His moralising and ideals would only allow the story to end on a certain high note. Artistically, this sacrificed some of the narrative tension, but it gives the message of the story a little added weight and authority. Matt Haig infuses his writing with his stark knowledge about depression and mental illness. He’s lived it. He knows what toll it can take. And he understands that healthy thinking and actions can change much about one’s present situation.Life is about perspective and sticking around long enough to see that it can change and develop. The Midnight Library explores this idea beautifully well. __________________________________You can connect with me on social media via My Linktree.__________________________________"

992,4.0,"The only way to learn is to live....Maybe there are no easy paths.Nora Seed is deeply depressed, and feels that she “wasn’t made for this life. Every move had been a mistake, every decision a disaster, every day a retreat from who she imagined she’d be.” And just as she decides to take her own life, she finds herself in a library between life and death: and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices. Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?Through the library, she can leave her “root life” and explore a multiverse’s worth of different versions of herself. If she finds a life she wants to remain in badly enough, she will, and she’ll forget her past and the library and eventually it will be as if she had always been there. Will you be shocked by the twists and turns of this tale? I doubt it; it’s not that kind of book. There’s enough world-building to generally explain the rules of the library, but don’t look too closely or it it probably crumbles (for example, there’s no mention of what happens to the versions of herself that she displaces every time she ‘slides’). And for someone so troubled and lost that she had just attempted suicide, Nora is amazingly perceptive about the problems in the lives of these other versions of herself.Instead, The Midnight Library is a deliberately optimistic story in which Nora comes to realize that she does want to live, and that while her root life may be troubled, it is still more right for her and more worth living than some other possible version—or no life at all. If you think this sounds a little bit like the movie It's A Wonderful Life, the author has freely admitted that this book was inspired by that movie. But he previously wrote a memoir about his battles with depression and nearly committing suicide when he was younger, so he certainly has a personal stake in writing a book about ""acceptance and realising that often you have a lot more than you think.” Nora sees how she affected those around her, and was loved by them, despite her pain. She realizes that she needs to stop trying to live out the dreams others had for her, and let go of her regrets.* The Midnight Library is a sort of parable, with a bit of a pop psychology and pop philosophy (and chess metaphors) mixed in. It reminded me of The Five People You Meet in Heaven. But the story works. It’s sweet and inspiring, and it lifted my spirits. Real people like Nora are out there, silently struggling, and you root for her (and them) to find their way out of the dark, to realize they would be missed and have much to live for. I hope the people who would be comforted by this book find it. Recommended.*It’s a bit too revealing to include in the review, but there’s a great quote on this idea that I’ve placed in the first comment for when I want to go back and remind myself of its wisdom."
993,4.0,"Nora Seed is extremely depressed. Life isn’t going her way. She’s 35, she’s left her fiance, she’s on the outs with her best friend, her beloved cat just died on the heels of her mother’s death, she’s lost her job, she’s let down her brother and bandmates by quitting their band on the verge of potential stardom due to her anxiety, and she lives with the regrets of failing her father’s once lofty dreams for her Olympic swimming career. Everywhere she turns she sees her life as a hopeless failure and herself as a disappointment. In her despair, she decides she wants her life to be over and takes steps to end it. In the limbo between life and death she finds herself in the Midnight Library.This magical library, overseen by a version of Mrs. Elm, Nora’s kindly grade school librarian, offers Nora the opportunity to choose “books” that are variations on her life that exist in a kind of alternate universe. In theory, think of it like a fitting room in a clothing store, where she’s able to try on lives to see if there’s one she wants to buy into. The only catch is that the library and any opportunities therein will disappear forever if she doesn’t ultimately decide she wants to live.I know. The description sounds pretty gloomy and dark, and I can’t argue too hard that it isn’t at least mildly depressive at times, but I would argue that it has a really beautiful and profoundly good point for all of us:Don’t live a life of regret.There were so many quotes that spoke to me in this book, but these are a few that stood out:“It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out.”“...there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness forever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.”“...we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad.”“We only know what we perceive. Everything we experience is ultimately our perception of it. ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.’”This book is deeply philosophical, so if that’s not your thing, you may not enjoy this one. I think Matt Haig is making his argument to the world to find the possibilities and contentment in the life you have, to appreciate the life you’ve been given and to live the life you want, not what others want or dream for you. Sometimes a good or bad life is simply determined by what we believe it to be. If you can see the point in the book, it’s brimming with hope and possibility!★★★★"

996,2.0,"Nora has a rough 24 hours, and she thinks her life is not worth living. She finds herself in a library where she can pick a book where her life would be different than her current life. Will Nora ultimately find the answers she is looking for? What about happiness?Sorry, this book has received absolute rave reviews, but this book was not for me. I found it extremely boring and unoriginal. There was a movie ages ago called ""The Family Man"" with Nicolas Cage which has an incredibly similar plot. The MC wakes up and finds himself married to his long lost love and is the father to two or three children. Nora spends a good deal of the book complaining about her life. I am surprised that she didn't try to bump herself off earlier if just a bad 24 hours is all that it takes to tip a person over the edge. Many people have horrible, no good, very bad days. They don't jump to the conclusion that life isn't worth living! Why was The Family Man better? Because it focused on one alternate life. He had built up relationships. In The Midnight Library, Nora tries on so many different lives that deep, meaningful relationships were not developed. There were some quotes in this book that I enjoyed. Also, I am absolutely obsessed with Walden by Thoreau, and he had quite a few mentions.Overall, not worth the hype, largely forgettable, and a better investment of your time and money would be to watch The Family Man."

“Pressure makes us, though. You start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond.’ She didn’t correct his knowledge of diamonds. She didn’t tell him that while coal and diamonds are both carbon, coal is too impure to be able, under whatever pressure, to become a diamond. According to science, you start off as coal and you end up as coal. Maybe that was the real-life lesson.”

I was just so happy when I saw that this book is dedicated to all the health and case workers in the world. It made me feel special. Anyway, I think I am a bigger fan of Haig’s fiction than his non-fiction. I tried Reasons to stay alive but I thought it was okay. This was better in my opinion, had very important messages and it was more fun to read. I think I am going to be discovering Haig’s fiction books in the future.The book is about a Midnight library that contains books and these books show us all of the possibilities that we could have lived. The protagonist Nora visits this library due to circumstances she’s going through, we get a quick glance about her life in the beginning and then we start getting to know her through all the options she could have lived. I think the idea is not new (Earlier this year I read Again Again which had a similar concept) but the execution was excellent. I think it is the best book with this concept that I have read so far. (A trigger warning for animal death at the start of the book.)Haig’s writing is very digestible in this book and I think it is an adult book that can be easily read by younger readers. I have to confess that I liked the very fast pacing and short chapters because it makes it almost impossible to put down and you’re just curious to see what options we will see next and how it will end overall. That being said I think the overall message gets clear early in the story and the ending is not hard to guess but that does not make it any less important because that’s the best most positive ending in my opinion and we got that. 

 “And even if you were a pawn – maybe we all are – then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary but it isn’t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.”

Summary: The Midnight Library is a sci-fi/ Contemporary story that has important messages. The book is fast-paced, short and it is a perfect quick read if you are looking for that but it discusses some heavy topics so take that in mind too. I liked the protagonist and the fact that she’s 35 and she’s still trying to figure out her life. The idea is very interesting and the execution is very well done. I do recommend it if you are a fan of the genre.You can get more books from Book Depository"

“every second of every day we are entering a new universe. and we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad.”

hello darkness, my old friend.matt haig and i have had a rocky first introduction, and it seems that we are not fated to be fast friends. still, there is some improvement on the horizon, and thus this review will not be as scathing as the last. but be warned that it’s still unpopular opinion time around here, folks.the premise of the midnight library is as follows: nora seed is a thoroughly depressed 35-year-old who decides that one day, after misfortune upon misfortune, enough is enough. she’s offered the opportunity to take a gander at all the possible lives she could’ve led if she’d made different choices at different points in her life -- and she can live that life for a while through picking out a book in the midnight library.so nora explores, and asks herself the big questions: what if she’d never quit her band? what if she’d kept swimming professionally? what if she’d said yes to the guy who asked her out for coffee? what if…? you get the idea. what follows is nora’s journey as she explores all these infinite possibilities, in which her other / parallel / alternate selves keep surprising her by whom they’ve become. and as she does, she tries to find that one life that makes her happy and is worth living.i liked the concept. the execution less so.first off, it’s very easy to predict this novel from beginning to end. i know, i know; sometimes it’s more about the journey than the destination. but i’d expected haig to take a slightly more interesting approach than simply having nora live a life for a couple of pages, learn her lesson, and move onto the next one.the lessons are given to the reader and nora in very on-the-nose, philosophy 101 dialectics kind of way. seriously, at times i felt i was back in my undergrad communications class with a bunch of very awkward students practicing cognitive behavioral therapy techniques on each other.often, the way haig gets these life lessons to the reader is also very clumsily constructed in a way that almost detracts from the narrative.for example: in one of her lives, nora has become a famous figure who gives inspirational speeches. she goes on to give a TED talk to a huge audience, and starts musing about her recent experiences with her ‘life hopping’ and how our lives are really just infinite branches on a tree. likewise, in many of her lives, nora writes poetry and posts her thoughts on social media. “hello there, reader, let me tell you about the Philosophy of Life,” said the author as he set up yet another poem / speech / monologue / song lyric to speak to the reader directly through his mouthpiece of a bland protagonist.look, if i’d want to read such overt inspirational bullshit, i’d pick up a self-help book or browse social media, not read a book about a depressed person trying to deal with the reality of being suicidal.
me while reading this book: all of them but mostly A
but, let’s talk positives here for a second. because they are there, believe me.obviously, some of the adventures that nora gets up to in certain lives are fun to read about -- such as her Arctic Life or her Ash Life (keeping this deliberately vague to circumvent spoilers). she continually surprises herself with who she can possibly become, and that slowly opens up her mind to seeing more possibility and potential in herself and her original life.the brief dive into nora losing her grip on reality and her own identity was a particularly nice touch, as well. because who are you truly if you’ve seen so many different iterations of yourself? so different from who you thought you were that they might not even be you anymore?i thought this was a great topic in general to include since depression often feels like it erases your identity in some ways already -- it takes away your joy, your hobbies, everything that can make you feel like you.there are also some quotes scattered throughout that were pretty good (see the one at the top of this review), even if haig’s chopped, staccato style of writing is not entirely to my tastes.the ending, though, was another let-down.(view spoiler)[of course, nora comes to the realization that even though her original life is a big damn mess, at least it’s her damn mess, and she finds her will to keep on living through it. and when she comes to and recovers from her suicide attempt… all her problems are gone. she revisits old friends and family, considers getting a dog, rearranges her life to better fit her needs -- her depression has disappeared completely. there’s zero follow-up on her still taking her meds or even going into therapy.it’s such a jarring, sugary-sweet wrap-up of a genuinely harrowing experience. i get that haig probably wanted to end on a positive note to show that there’s always light at the end of the tunnel but usually depression does not go POOF, unfortunately. (hide spoiler)]i want to end this review by making it very clear that i am not here to shit on how haig copes with his own depression. he’s been very open about being (and having been) anxious, depressed, and suicidal, and he uses his platform to advocate for mental health -- which i think is great!it just appears the way he processes and works through his own mental health issues is very different from mine, and due to that i can safely say i did not connect to this book AT ALL. plus, i still do see some issues with representing depression as something that can be combated purely by ‘inspirational thoughts’; seeing your own potential, changing your perspective on your life, putting yourself to work so you can actually achieve something, etc. these things can be part of the solution, sure.but depression is not a series of regrets that disappears once you stop regretting. depression is a very serious illness that often requires meds as well as therapy, and is in many cases chronic as well. and i did not feel that it was treated with that level of seriousness in the book, especially considering the ending.still, i can see how this book might resonate with lots of people and inspire them to be easier on themselves and their lives. so if its premise and quotes appeal to you, don’t be afraid to pick it up.✎ 2.5 stars."
999,2.0,"Deși nu-mi recunosc însușiri de clarvăzător, acțiunea cărții mi s-a părut (cam după 20 de pagini) previzibilă. Îți dai seama din capul locului că Nora Seed, 35 de ani, absolventă de Filosofie, talentată la muzică, cu calități de înotătoare ieșite din comun - care n-a reușit nimic în viață, după socoteala ei de pacient depresiv - nu va reuși nici măcar să se sinucidă ca lumea. Textul e didactic ca o lecție de manual pe tema „5 motive de a nu-ți pune capăt vieții”. Sigur, viața e frumoasă (măcar pentru rațiunea că e unică), oamenii sînt întotdeauna prietenoși și săritori, cerul e mereu senin, de la robinet curge apă minerală, frigiderul se încarcă de la sine cu bunătăți, băncile ne roagă să primim împrumuturi nerambursabile. Mai mult, fericirea însăși, fericirea cu F mare, e doar la un milimetru distanță de noi, trebuie doar să întindem mîna și s-o înșfăcăm. Și cine nu vrea? Trucul narativ folosit de Matt Haig a mai fost încercat cu succes și de alții (Ambrose Bierce, Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortázar etc.). Un personaj trăiește o mulțime de vieți într-o clipă (34 de secunde, în cazul de față). Timpul se dilată și Nora Seed (numele e simbolic, desigur) are răgazul să priceapă că întreaga ei viziune despre lume și viață era greșită. Decît să-ți frămînți mintea cu gînduri întunecate și fără spor, mai bine joci șah cu doamna Louise Elm și mănînci grisine.În concluzie, fraților, viața e un miracol și cel mai nimerit lucru e să te bucuri de ea. Cît ești viu...P. S. Un sfat foarte util de la Nora: „Dacă urmărești să devii ceva ce nu ești, vei da greș întotdeauna. Fii tu însuți. Arată, comportă-te natural și gîndește cu mintea ta. Fii cea mai sinceră variantă a ta. Acceptă-ți eul. Susține-l. Iubește-l. Străduiește-te pentru el. Nu te abate atunci cînd oamenii îl iau în rîs sau îl batjocoresc. Cele mai multe bîrfe ascund invidie. Ține capul plecat. Păstrează-ți energia. Continuă să înoți”."

1001,5.0,"  “Never underestimate the big importance of small things.”  I honestly, completely, truly love this book and I am sure I'm going to re-read it multiple times throughout my life. No doubt it won the Goodreads Choice 2020 Award. Matt Haig is a superb storyteller and will have you hooked from beginning to end. People who have experienced dark moments in their lives will be able to resonate with the protagonist.Nora Seed wants to die.This is where we begin, with a young woman on the verge of making a terrible choice. She's lost her job, her best friend, her brother. Her relationships are in shambles and her cat is dead. More importantly, she is just deeply, seemingly irretrievably, sad. She can't imagine a day that is better with her in it. Living has become nothing but a chore.The book works on the premise that between life and death, there is a library, where the books contain the stories of multiple realities. What could have been, what could be and how every version of one's life worked out?"
1002,4.0,"Your life is your story. And we don't always hold the pen that scribes it.Matt Haig presents a novel lined with the shoulda, coulda, woulda feathers that float around inside our heads. We're at the receiving end of our own amazing or ill-fated choices or we stand in the ashes created by others. It's a crap shoot one day and then a deliberate, devastating, euphoric, confusing, regretful, mindboggling, sh$t-on-a-stick ride the next.Nora Seed lives in the land of depression and suppression most days. When you sit in your dark space, the droplet of another deadend life experience can send you gripping the edge and looking into the abyss. After a troubling life with repeated episodes of failures,that droplet came with the news that her long-loved cat had been hit by a car and died near the curb. Nora took to making plans. Determined plans. Plans to check out.But something will cause Nora to look beyond the mist and the fog. There's an image of a tall building with classic pillars at the entrance. The fragrance of well-bound books leads her within. And there in this unusual library is the likes of the librarian, Mrs. Elm. She explains that each volume contains a different life choice for Nora. She could experience a marriage that she avoided, a missed career as a glaciologist, the professional Olympic swimming opportunity that she checked out of, and so many more regrets. Haig takes us through the options and we are intrigued for our own sake.The Midnight Library is well written and creative in its approach. Haig, himself, has suffered from depression. It brought to mind a Billy Joel song called ""You're Only Human (Second Wind)"". Billy Joel wrote the song in regard to his own depression and that of a friend's teenage son. It's upbeat and far from preachy or maudlin. He emphasizes that we're too quick to judge life in that bad moment. There's a Second Wind that comes along and can move us in a completely different direction if we allow it. More than ever, during these challenging times, we've got to open our eyes mightily and search for that Second Wind. It's there for the taking.A quick read packed with life lessons. Maybe some of those great disappointments in life would have been far, far more bitter than the sweetness we once envisioned and wrapped them in."
1003,2.0,"If you’re a fan of A Christmas Carol, you’d like this book. But I found it overly repetitive in the way we continually watch this protagonist look at different versions of her life for the entire novel. I was good with one exploration, but having 10+ peeks into different realities that she could live in truly lost me, the same way A Christmas Carol lost me. I’d also greatly caution readers because if, like me, you also are dealing with severe depression, this book is just very triggering, and *sighs* it just wasn’t what I thought it’d be. Yeah,,, anyway. "
1004,4.0,"Matt Haig is an author I enjoy because his writing comes from his experience with depression and anxiety, and flows with compassion. Not the sticky sweet compassion, but the inner heart compassion. He really is a man with a message for the depressed and the anxious. He’s been there and it comes across in his writing. Those of us who have experienced dark moments can identify with the main character in this novel. Nora Seed has just had one of the worst days of her life. The decision she makes at the end of that day takes her to ‘The Midnight Library,’ where the librarian hands her the book of regret. It’s personalized, all the regrets that Nora has ever had are recorded in this book. This reminds me a bit of Edgar Cayce’s Akashic Records where supposedly all the information about our lives are stored, heaven’s super-computer, so to speak. Haig steps it up a bit, creating a personal library for all the possible lives we could have lived or the lives we are living in parallel universes. In the library, Nora is between life and death, like Schrödinger’s cat in the famous thought experiment. Here, she pulls books from the shelves and tries on different lives where decisions she has made have caused her to take other paths. It was easy to think of all the different paths my own life could have taken as I read about Nora’s choices. I have my own regrets and if I could have avoided even being faced with some of my choices, I would have. I’m sure other readers will have similar thoughts. How about the life that is most successful? What does that success entail? Fame, wealth, status? Or those less subtle but ultimately more meaningful markers of relationship and connectivity? Haig explores choices and regrets and a meaningful life. The narrative lagged in a few spots, but I was always interested in picking the book up and reading more. It is full of quotable passages, which is something I enjoy about Haig’s writing. For me, the following is a mind-blowing passage, especially for those times when I feel frozen. It made me think that making one more move might blow out some doors or at least open them. “Look at that chessboard we put back in place,’ said Mrs Elm softly. ‘Look at how ordered and safe and peaceful it looks now, before a game starts. It’s a beautiful thing. But it is boring. It is dead. And yet the moment you make a move on that board, things change. Things begin to get more chaotic. And that chaos builds with every single move you make.’‘It’s an easy game to play,’ she told Nora. ‘But a hard one to master. Every move you make opens a whole new world of possibilities...In chess, as in life, possibility is the basis of everything. Every hope, every dream, every regret, every moment of living...never underestimate the big importance of small things.”"
1005,4.0,Short snappy chapters that pull the reader right in to this almost ghost of Christmas past / Scrooge type setting...altho this may have something to do with the time of year I'm reading it 😅🎄The intro is a bit rough and may be triggering to some. This read should prob come with a warning as the MCs thoughts spiral quickly and may hit very close to home for some readers Toys with one of my fav tropes of varied timelines/alternate realities and how things may differ based on choices & decisions made or not as the case may be.Sweet read that simultaneously gave me some warm fuzzies & plenty food for thought. I really like Matt Haig's no frills way of writing about different aspects of mental health keeping things grounded without being too dark yet also not shying away from helping the reader think about and look into the darker corners.

About the Book
This book was a treasure for me.It took me through so many feelings and thoughts and emotions and then finally, it gave me a breath of fresh air.This book is about dealing with depression, about suicide, about hope and opportunity, about regrets and making them right, about chances and new choices but most of all, this book is about seeing. It's about seeing that whatever happens, happens for a reason while also knowing it's never too late to make decisions for yourself. It's about stop regretting and start accepting and looking towards the light instead of looking at that endless black hole of thoughts that will do nothing except for draining your life.—This book is WAY MORE THAN just a Fantasy Book.
It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.

Review
It starts with Nora Seed, who feels like she's not capable of doing anything right in her life. She thinks her existence means nothing and that all she has ever done is disappoint everyone. That all her choices have been a mistake and she regrets so many things that she doesn't even realize when those regrets start sucking the life out of her. She thinks she has failed at the most basic of things: living.BUT right when Nora stands on that thin line between life and death, she discovers the Midnight Library.In the Midnight Library, there is a book on every single possibility in life for the person who decides to read it. There is a book on every single choice that you might have made differently. Like,—what if you missed your flight that day?—Or what if you said yes to marrying someone?—What if you didn't like music?—What if you didn't like swimming?You name that what-if and there would be a book about it and we all know reading a book is like a journey.So Nora travels through these books and lives through them but she can only read at midnight.And she can not read any book twice. And why would you want to when there are so many books? Of course you'd want to read more books instead of rereading them right away, huh?Well, after reading all these books Nora understands what she finally wants in life and which life she wants to live and it's just a full of possibility.This book was very relaxing and calming for me. It was overflowing with hope and realization and positive vibes. I must say I recommend it to EVERYONE!
SPOILERS AHEAD

The Best part about this Book
I loved how much I could relate with Nora.I loved how inspiring and motivational this book was.I loved the perspective this book gave me and how much it helped me mentally.People often asked for fun, ""would you rather go back in time or in future"" and I always thought future. BUT, the Midnight Library made me realize how right I was to always choose it, even if that was an unconscious answer for fun.I loved knowing how amazing it is to go back in time and live life with different choices and learning how harmful regrets can be.
Regrets don’t leave. They weren’t mosquito bites. They itch for ever.
I loved realising that no matter what we think of our mistakes and no matter how much we dwell on the what-if's and if-only's, it's what we do now that matters.I loved seeing that Nora Seed understood she wanted to live and make her life better and that she understood that living in the past was like living the life of a ghost and that it was the present moment that she needed to live through and make right and worth it.I'm very happy about the ending and Glad that she came back. I really loved the part where she was happy in her life with Ash and her daughter but I didn't want her to stay there. I didn't want her to abandon her REAL LIFE for it. I wanted her to make her real life THAT HAPPY and even though it's not something we got to read about in the book, I hope with all my heart that she found a way to be with Ash and have a family with him and be happy and feel blessed. I'd like to think that she made her life better and was grateful for it. Life really is precious and it's amazing how this author wrote on mental health and suicide with such a beautiful fantasy as a help.The thing is, for me, that Library is real.
‘Listen. I am part of the library. But this whole library is part of you. Do you understand? You don’t exist because of the library; this library exists because of you. Remember what Hugo said? He told you that this is the simplest way your brain translates the strange and multifarious reality of the universe. So, this is just your brain translating something. Something significant and dangerous.’
That Library is inside every one of us readers and as beautiful as the idea of it is, we should be grateful that none of us has to go visit it.We should be grateful that someone out there in the world took some time out and wrote this book and made us realize how lucky we are to sit at home and read this book without having to go through so many things.I feel like the Mrs. Elm who was the librarian inside Nora's midnight library. She was not sucked into Nora's lives when she read them, only Nora was. Because Nora wanted to and deeply needed to live it all and see how far she's come.I know I'm being emotional but I'm very grateful this story.°*•★•*°°*•★•*°Ps: this book was nothing like the 
The Starless Sea
 but guess what? After reading this book, I appreciate that book a little more. I appreciate every door I opened through that book and I might just need to reread it and I'll probably fall in love.And thank you to Maryam for recommending this book, and Lilah and Alyssa for giving me the motivation to read it :) you guys are the best. ❤️_____________________

1008,5.0,"‘Between life and death there is a library ,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’ In a book that channels Friedrich Nietzsche, Jimmy Stewart in It's A Wonderful Life, and even Doctor Who and his amazing Tardis, we get a schmaltzy feel-good life-affirming fable. Nietzsche expressed it as a question of what your response would be if a demon crept up to you and said you would live this same life innumerable times including every joy and pain, would you leap in joy or curse him to the end of eternity. Frank Capra's beloved Christmas movie starring Jimmy Stewart has us thinking about what life would be like without you and the things you accomplished or the differences you made without even realizing it. Matt Haig approaches the meaning of life more like Doctor Who trapped in a Tardis with no controls where you never know where you might end up. For Nora Seed, the library between life and death is such a vehicle that allows her to travel into parallel universes where life turned out differently because she made different choices along the way. Kind of like time travel, but not cause she stays in the same time zone just in different lives. There's a life where she becomes a rockstar, one where she is a scientist, one an Olympic athlete, etc, etc. just pick a different book and see where you end up.Only -- Haig's library of books is like a genie's three wishes. Well, you are not limited to three. There's an infinite number of books. But, your wishes just may not turn out how you think. Every path traveled leads somewhere, but maybe the grass isn't always greener and maybe things didn't turn out how you think they would. This is not a fantasy book for those seeking knights in armor, fell dragons, or magic sorcerers. There simply may not be enough action or enough excitement for some readers. It's a fable that uses the construct of an endless library to explore ideas. It's cleverly done and quite an easy read. And there's a sense of humor at work here cause each time Nora drops into an alternate life, she's got to try and figure out her new past and how her new life works without anyone being the wiser, not even a best friend or a new husband. It's quite a feat pretending to be one's self when one is not altogether familiar with one's new life. Many thanks to the publisher for providing a copy for review."
1009,4.0,"What if you could take a different path and and live a different life, or a hundred different lives, if given the opportunity? Such is the story of “The Midnight Library” by Matt Haig. Nora Seed is a woman who has known struggle. Nothing has turned out the way that she imagined it would. Depressed and alone, she is contemplating completing suicide. It is at that moment, that Nora finds herself in “The Midnight Library.” Here, opportunity awaits.Nora now has choices to make. She can pick up a book that will allow her to choose a life that she could have lived, if she had taken a different path. All she has to do is grab a book. Each time Nora chooses a new life, she has no memory of her new self up until that point. She becomes a Bar Owner and Wife, a Rockstar, an Olympic Medalist, a Glaciologist, a Wife and Mother. Once she realizes that that life is not for her, she is immediately pulled from it and brought back to the library to make a new choice. In the end, Nora of course, realizes where she belongs and what is best for her. For me, what was prevalent here is the idea of that life is what you make of it and given the state of the nation, I felt truly comforted by that. “The Midnight Library” is character driven literary fiction, fantasy and science fiction all rolled into one. It is wholly satisfying and absolutely stupendous. A heartwarming read that is just what this reader was looking for!Published on Goodreads on 11.15.20."
1010,5.0,"I really don't know how to put into words how much I loved my first Matt Haig book, The Midnight Library. I must be the only person who has never read one of his books and now I am seriously asking myself why. I had heard alot of good things about this book, and come on, it is set in a library! I had to read it.The Midnight Library is a library like no other. It is located in a world between life and death. It holds an infinite number of books, each one the chance to change your life. Nora Seed finds herself in the Midnight Library when she decides one night that she has had enough of life. She is lonely, depressed and has nothing left to live for. When she arrives into this magical place she is given and unlimited amount of chances to do things differently. Every single decision that we make in our lives, big or small, has an impact on who we are and how our live turns out. What if she had married her boyfriend? What if she had stuck with swimming? These are just some of the regrets Nora has had in her life and now she can see another path.This is a beautiful book that I could not get enough of. I was really sad when it was over. I felt a connection to Nora and was hoping that she would make the right choices. Over 2 nights I was absorbed in the world of the Midnight Library . I highly recommend you take a trip there too.Thank you to Allen and Unwin for sending me an advanced copy of this book to read."
1011,5.0,Touching. Brilliant. Raw. Everyone needs to read this; you won't regret it. It really encourages you to look at your own life and to appreciate what you have ... phenomenal.
1012,2.0,"Two disappointed stars. I confess I don't really get the idea of not having any regrets; they are as much a part of life as grief, contentment, and loneliness. One can't be truly alive without wishing they'd done something or two a bit differently. This is probably why I've been utterly and completely unable to connect with Nora and the whole concept of the Midnight Library. It just sounded like pretentious bullshit, to be honest. The characters weren't any help either. What ultimately saved this book from one disillusioned star was Haig's prose, which could be occasionally beautiful, and a couple of heart-warming scenes, especially with Joe, Ash, and Molly. Otherwise it was insipid, frustrating, and even infuriating at times. Even if the notion of undoing regrets were original (which it wasn't), Nora's final insights were glaringly obvious and not at all enlightening. I hope my next Matt Haig novel proves to be more entertaining and thought-provoking. This one wasn't."
1013,4.0,"3.5 stars rounded up. While I really enjoyed the premise of this one, I was hoping for a little...more. I think I wanted to see more of the magical elements of the library, whereas the story focused more on the emotional aspects of the plot. I understand why the book was written that way, it just felt like something was missing for me, and I can't quite pinpoint what. That all aside, I did think the story was beautiful. I could relate to Nora and her depression, and seeing how some of her alternate lives would have played out was interesting. I really enjoyed the way the story wrapped up. If you're a fan of 'groundhog day' type of plots, this will likely be a great choice for you!"

1016,4.0,"Magical, moving, and memorable!Nora Seed has come to the end of the line: both mentally and emotionally. A particularly bad day and the loss of her beloved cat Voltaire (affectionately known as Volts) has left her feeling unloved, isolated, and grasping for any sense of connection. Feeling utterly broken, Nora decides she wants to end her life and after a brief post online takes to a bottle of wine and an overdose of pills. Surprisingly, Nora wakes, finding herself in a strange and glorious library, wall-to-wall with books and her old childhood librarian Mrs. Elm helming the circulation desk. She quickly discovers that this Midnight Library is full of very 'personalized' books: each book is a variation of a life she might have lived, had she only made different choices. Nora is also confronted with the Book of Regrets, summarizing all of her deepest fears and giving her the impetus she needs to select the first life she wants to explore. Mrs. Elm warns her that even the mildest disappointment with the new life selected will send her right back to the library, where she only has limited time. Armed with this advice, Nora begins her journey, rocketing from Olympic swimming glory to rock stardom, and from life as a glaciologist to barely scraping by at a low-wage job in Australia. Can she discover what will make her truly happy and bring her lasting fulfillment before the library disappears...for good?Matt Haig has absolutely done it again. The first 40% or so of this book I read in one sitting, utterly drawn in by Nora and the beautiful fantasy in this story. Haig deals with mental health struggles in such a delicate yet accessible way, giving credence to the real challenges we all face and the uncertainty and anxiety that stems from all of the 'what ifs' in our lives. I knew I would love this book from the minute I first read the synopsis so many months ago, and as much as I thought I would adore it, my expectations were exceeded the entire way. Haig also spent so much time unraveling all of the layers in Nina's character, by the time the book was over I was truly sad to see her go and not be a part of her world anymore. Haig also could have easily jumped to a cliche ending, but instead stayed true to life and the character, and I really appreciated that artistic choice. I absolutely loved that I left this story with so much to think about and reflect on in my own life and a new perspective on how all of the choices I've made in life have led me here: to this moment, now. An imagined future might seem shiny and spotless, but the beauty is in the life we actually make and the love we have to share. This book is beautiful, hopeful, tender, and authentic from start to finish. A tour-de-force of emotion that will stick with me for some time, and in my opinion, Haig's finest work to date. 4.5 ⭐"
1017,3.0,"3.5 liked it but didn't love it starsMaybe this one just had too much hype and I went in expecting too much. Or maybe it's because the world is so turned around, but I just couldn't embrace this one. I found the character unsympathetic to the point that I almost didn't care what happened . . . I know that most others loved this book. It has a great premise, this in-between space between life and death where you can analyze all the choices you've made, think through your regrets, maybe choose a different life path -- all through the Midnight Library. Don't let my review dissuade you from reading the book as I'm definitely in the minority here! I did like the positive messaging around mental health, letting go of regrets, and making the most of your life."
1018,4.0,"[3.5] Just the novel I needed. This could have been simplistic and silly but it worked for me. Burdened by regrets, Nora gets to experience various other choices in her life. Ultimately uplifting."
1019,4.0,"This is a great read! I loved the premise; a woman caught between life and death is given the chance to go back and change her biggest regrets! It’s written with such empathy and is really beautiful at times but I would have liked a little more depth. Esp in some of her alternative lives. They were really rushed. And her parents, their deaths are kinda brushed over. Surely that would be something big you’d want to go back and see them alive?! But overall a fab book and definitely one of my favourite reads of 2020. 👍"
1021,2.0,"This is a difficult one to rate: such a wonderful premise, revolving around the sentiment of one of my favourite Plath quotes. Alas, such poor execution.The evocation of mental health, particularly depression or (beautifully put) feeling superfluous in the universe, are sensitive and compelling. However, Haig’s prose is choppy. I can’t think of another word that encapsulates it so aptly. The narrative is rather staccato, snipped into unnecessarily small chapters with cheap cliffhangers. It’s all saturated with filter words that add distance to an already plodding plot.I gave up at roughly 25%. The subjunctive ‘what if’ is a premise that has been taken on and done very well by some more capable writers – this interpretation wasn’t at all compelling beyond its bare bones.With thanks to the publisher for the proof copy."
1022,4.0,"I read this knowing literally nothing about it other than I've read two other books by him and he recently won the 2020 GR Fiction award. Plus, the title. The title was nice and I trust the writer, so I was like, WHY NOT?I kinda expected some fantasy treatment with a nice librarian. What I got was a fantasy treatment with a nice librarian. The adventure?It's all about regrets, baby. So strap yourself in, get your failed life perspective glasses on, and start feeling sorry for yourself, because it's time to try all those other lives on for size. Do it again. Make all those other choices. Get your Schrodinger's Cat on.That's it, really. Best of all possible worlds.Of course, a novel like this is all about the journey. And as for the journey, I enjoyed every second of it. It's always fun seeing what could have been. What if, what if, what if? And we get a LOT of those.So why is this actually called regular Fiction, rather than Fantasy? No clue. It looks like an utter fantasy to me. But these lines are divided very strangely. Almost as if someone arbitrarily made some strange choice in the past and catapulted this novel into a strange new alternate universe where it was DIFFERENT.I had fun. Got a few tears. Felt depressed, then good again. It's that kind of novel. :)"
1023,4.0,This was available as a READ NOW on NetGalley. I downloaded it and just found it is the book club discussion questions and NOT the book itself. bummer as I have not read the book....but I did look through the questions and they are quite thorough. I think this would be extremely helpful to book clubs and those who want to discuss the book with others. I will be keeping the discussion questions and looking over them once again once I do in fact read the book.I received a copy of this from Penguin and NetGalley. I look forward to reading the book and using this guide.
1024,4.0,"Mettete in una storia una serie di riflessioni sulla depressione, l’ansia, il rimorso, i rimpianti, la frustrazione... e niente, io sarò per forza parte di quel libro e quel libro vivrà dentro di me. Matt haig è pop, che per tante persone può essere visto come un difetto (e probabilmente lo è) ma è dannatamente godibile. Non mi ha convinta del tutto la piega che ha preso ad un certo punto la storia e il finale è un po’ tanto scontatello ma ho adorato e divorato La biblioteca di mezzanotte. Oh si!"
1025,4.0,"4★“Nora went through her social media. No messages, no comments, no new followers, no friend requests. She was antimatter, with added self-pity.She went on Instagram and saw everyone had worked out how to live, except her. She posted a rambling update on Facebook, which she didn’t even really use anymore.Two hours before she decided to die, she opened a bottle of wine.”So, Nora, you’re a mess. And you know it. ‘Nobody loves me, everybody hates me, I’m gonna go eat worms’, as little kids I grew up with used to chant. You might rather be a sort of nothing.“Nora stared down at the small mole on her left hand. That mole had been through everything she’d been through. And it just stayed there, not caring. Just being a mole.”Well, Matt Haig has some surprises in store for you . . . and your mole!But a warning – watch out for the wine and any other bad choices that could send you loopy. Hang on, things are going to get hairy! Remember your favourite librarian, Mrs. Elm? Guess what? She’s still a librarian, and you, lucky you, are about to see her again. “As she spoke, Mrs. Elm’s eyes came alive, twinkling puddles in moonlight.‘Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices.’”Turns out, you have/had an infinite number of choices, Nora. Mrs. Elm will tell you about the Robert Frost poem.“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I – I took the road less travelled by, And that has made all the difference . . .” But then she asks you, what if there were more than two roads, an endless number of roads? What would Frost have done? What would YOU do?Isn't it nice that Mrs. Elm is named for a tree? A tree that has, well maybe not an infinite number of branches, but a lot.Now guess what? Mrs. Elm is going to show you an infinite number of shelves, climbing out of sight into the heavens, filled with your books, your life choices. Go ahead, be brave. Pick one and dive in! Who knows?NORA dives in. This is fun, a bit preachy and a bit expected, but entertaining. It reminds me of the old Quantum Leap show where the hero suddenly landed somewhere in time to sort things out. Nora does much the same, seeing her life and the people in it from different perspectives. If her life changes, so does theirs. I’ll quote from only one. No, two, because I liked the title of this chapter.“Why Want Another Universe If This One Has Dogs?””Below is a favourite ‘landing’, but it’s not a spoiler.“But since entering the Midnight Library Nora had slowly got used to the peculiar.. . . She felt her ring finger.Two rings.The man turned over.An arm landed across her in the dark and she gently raised it and placed it back on the duvet.”Although the message isn’t new, and many of the situations seem a little obvious, it is an entertaining read that I hope might help pull a few people back from the brink, stop them from living and dying and measuring success by social media and dwelling on bitter regrets. Sometimes what seems obvious to me, isn’t obvious or believable when you’re in the depths of despair."
1026,4.0,"★ ★ ★ ½, rounded up because I finished the book smilingI started The Midnight Library and was groaning, ""Ugh. Nora is the weakest, most tedious character I've encountered in AGES."" I was ready to throw in the towel at only 10% in.Then I checked with my Goodreads gang, read some reviews, and realized change was coming. Better was coming. And thank all the gods, heartwarming was coming. So I stuck it out.I'm so glad I did. Was this as dazzling as A Gift of Time or Life After Life? No, not even close. (Those had me fugly crying.) This was a polite and more careful version of the ""If I Could Turn Back Time"" genre, but still quite effective. Entirely predictable, but effective nonetheless.I do enjoy Matt Haig's books, and How to Stop Time still ranks as my personal favorite. I'd put The Midnight Library as a not-so-close second."
1027,4.0,"This was sooo close to a 5 star read, until it's disappointingly saccharine ending. I was immediately drawn into this story! Nora is very unhappy with her life and is having a very bad day (trigger warning: (view spoiler)[suicide attempt (hide spoiler)]). She finds herself in 'the midnight library' where every book represents different versions of her life where she can undo her many regrets (it's a multiverse thing, which I personally love). As Nora literally tries out various versions of her life, she gets closer and closer to the life she really wants to have. I will say Nora is definitely not your typical person, she has a LOT of variety in her lives - I suspect that my own lives would all just be slightly different shades of the same color compared to Nora's rainbow spectrum of lives. I really enjoyed this part of the book though as we got to see how decisions led to radically different outcomes. The last life in particular gave me great joy and I was hoping the story would kind of end there, but instead we get this great big metaphor represented in physical form in the story and an ending that left me unhappy with how trite it felt. But that was literally the last 5% of the book that I didn't like, the other 95% I was completely enthralled with. I would still recommend it heartily despite the ending."
1028,5.0,"Q: Nora had no idea what success was. She had felt like a failure for so long. (c) Q: ‘I don’t like this. I want it to stop. I want to cancel my membership of the library.

Another undisputable FAV for all eternity! This book needs to be pill-packaged and sold to depressed people worldwide!Herewith I'm proclaiming my eternal love of all things Matt Haig. For one thing, it's about a LIBRARY! For another it's a parallel world library, with books being the portals to parallel worlds! Considering that I've just read another great book with parallel world setting in place (The Space Between Worlds!), I'm loving every second of it.Yet another thing to love is this: Matt Haig, being Matt Haig, just couldn't write a regular world-jumping book and be done with it. It had to be set in just the way to be conductive to be therapeutic to the readers. Maybe I'll just eat this book to get the most benefits from it :) They need to package it and sell as antidepressant pills!We start at a library and wind up with Nora Seed working for 12 years at a bookshop, String Theory. At 30 she's still there, with a Degree in Philosophy and a cat that has just died. Then our Nora goes on a tour-de-force through parallel lives. In most she leaves a mess behind: in Australia, I think, she loses a job, in the Olympic life - she leaves behind a mess of a mangled speech, a row with Dan, a 'disastrous rendition of Chopin’s Piano Concerto No. 2 at the Finlandia Hall in Helsinki'… And sliding out while having sex?I've 1 world-building question here: was it midnight in the Library or wasn't it? If it was and the time actually was stopped then why the tremors, in the real life during that minute there should've been no new developments with Nora. She gets fired in the most ludicrous way I've ever heard of:Q:It’s just that when times are tough I can’t pay you to put off customers with your face looking like a wet weekend.’‘What?' (c) Right, WHAT the hell? And she has the most ridiculous talks with people around:Q:‘Nora Seed?’...‘Yep.’‘I’m Kerry-Anne. Remember you from school. The swimmer. Super-brain. Didn’t whatshisface, Mr Blandford, do an assembly on you once? Said you were going to end up at the Olympics?’...‘So, did you?’‘I, um, gave it up. Was more into music . . . at the time. Then life happened.’‘So what do you do now?’‘I’m . . . between things.’‘Got anyone, then? Bloke? Kids?’Nora shook her head. ...‘Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock.’ (c) Drat. What an enlightening discussion.She's a philosopher to the boot:Q:‘Go confidently in the direction of your dreams,’ Thoreau had said. ‘Live the life you’ve imagined.’Thoreau had been her favourite philosopher to study. But who seriously goes confidently in the direction of their dreams? Well, apart from Thoreau. He’d gone and lived in the woods, with no contact from the outside world, to just sit there and write and chop wood and fish. (c) Q:At university she had done an essay drily titled ‘The Principles of Hobbesian Memory and Imagination’. Thomas Hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing, and since discovering that she had never entirely trusted her memories. (c) Q:She remembered studying Aristotle as a first-year Philosophy student. And being a bit depressed by his idea that excellence was never an accident. That excellent outcomes were the result of ‘the wise choice of many alternatives’. And here she was, in the privileged position of being able to sample these many alternatives. It was a shortcut to wisdom and maybe a shortcut to happiness too. She saw it now not as a burden but a gift to be cherished. (c) Q:‘Life begins,’ Sartre once wrote, ‘on the other side of despair.’ (c)She's also a Q: Swimmer. Musician. Philosopher. Spouse. Traveller. Glaciologist. Happy. Loved. (c) All failed. She's also Q:a rock star, an Olympian, a music teacher, a primary school teacher, a professor, a CEO, a PA, a chef, a glaciologist, a climatologist, an acrobat, a tree-planter, an audit manager, a hair-dresser, a professional dog walker, an office clerk, a software developer, a receptionist, a hotel cleaner, a politician, a lawyer, a shoplifter, the head of an ocean protection charity, a shop worker (again), a waitress, a first-line supervisor, a glass-blower and a thousand other things… (c)So, she gets to the Midnight Library which is an infinitely large library of all books of all possible lives of Nora. Her old librarian, Mrs Elm, is charoning her around. (I do think that Mrs Elm is just a figment of Nora's imagination, a brain trying to explain things in user-friendly terms and to introduce something known into the vastness of unknown between lives or even worlds. Hugo insisted that Mrs Elm and Philippe are interpretations.). Q:I see a simplified version of the truth. The librarian is just a kind of mental metaphor. The whole thing is. (c)The Midnight Library:Q:Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’ (c) Q:‘Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small. But every time one decision is taken over another, the outcomes differ. An irreversible variation occurs, which in turn leads to further variations. These books are portals to all the lives you could be living.’ (c)Q:‘Librarians have knowledge. They guide you to the right books. The right worlds. They find the best places. Like soul-enhanced search engines.’ (c)The quantum discussion (where would we be without it?):Q:‘Erwin Schrödinger . . .’‘He of the cat.’‘Yes. The cat guy. He said that in quantum physics every alternative possibility happens simultaneously. All at once. In the same place. Quantum superposition. The cat in the box is both alive and dead. You could open the box and see that it was alive or dead, that’s how it goes, but in one sense, even after the box is open, the cat is still both alive and dead. Every universe exists over every other universe. Like a million pictures on tracing paper, all with slight variations within the same frame. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics suggests there are an infinite number of divergent parallel universes. Every moment of your life you enter a new universe. With every decision you make. And traditionally it was thought that there could be no communication or transference between those worlds, even though they happen in the same space, even though they happen literally millimetres away from us.’ (c) Q:‘What if there are more than two roads diverging in the wood? What if there are more roads than trees? What if there is no end to the choices you could make? What would Robert Frost do then?’ (c) Q:She learned that undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true. There was almost any life she was living in one universe, after all. (c)Q:Going for a coffee with Ash might have led, for instance, to Nora falling in love with the person serving the coffee. That was simply the unpredictable nature of quantum physics. (c)The empowering things:Q:Every second of every day we are entering a new universe. And we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad. …it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. …But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in. (c)Q:‘You need to realise something if you are ever to succeed at chess,’ she said, as if Nora had nothing bigger to think about. ‘And the thing you need to realise is this: the game is never over until it is over. It isn’t over if there is a single pawn still on the board. If one side is down to a pawn and a king, and the other side has every player, there is still a game. And even if you were a pawn – maybe we all are – then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary but it isn’t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.’ (c)Q:Fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut. Despair was when the door closed and locked behind you.But with every life she saw that metaphorical door widen a little further as she grew better at using her imagination. (c) Q:She could have been all those amazing things, and that wasn’t depressing, as she had once thought. Not at all. It was inspiring. Because now she saw the kinds of things she could do when she put herself to work. … What sometimes feels like a trap is actually just a trick of the mind. … She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. (c)Q:We don’t have to do everything in order to be everything, because we are already infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility. (c) Q:… life sometimes simply gave you a whole new perspective by waiting around long enough for you to see it. (c)Sliders are a hoot, aren't they?Q:‘I’m sorry,’ his other self said, as he sipped his wine and the sun set behind him, ‘I’ve forgotten who you are.’‘Don’t worry,’ she said. ‘So have I.’ (c)Other fun stuff:Q:Ever cleaned pub toilets, Nora?’‘I’m having a pretty shit time too, if we’re doing the Misery Olympics.’ (c)Q:‘It was a lot of pressure.’‘Pressure makes us, though. You start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond.’ (c) Q:Every move had been a mistake, every decision a disaster, every day a retreat from who she’d imagined she’d be. …She knew only one thing with absolute certainty: she didn’t want to reach tomorrow. (c)Q:‘You don’t go to death. Death comes to you.’Even death was something Nora couldn’t do properly, it seemed. (c) Q:Did you do anything wrong?’That was an easy one. ‘Yes. Absolutely everything.’ (c)Q:… while most people were into rock music you were into actual rocks and stuff.’ (c)Q:You have yourself in quite high esteem there, Nora.’‘Shouldn’t I? I mean, shouldn’t everyone? What’s wrong with self-esteem? (c) Q:I have carefully calculated that the pain of me living as the bloody disaster that is myself is greater than the pain anyone else will feel if I were to die. In fact, I’m sure it would be a relief. (c) Q:She wondered how many Dans there were in the world, dreaming of things they would hate if they actually got them. And how many were pushing other people into their delusional idea of happiness? (c) Q:‘Interesting. I had no idea there was such a thing as between-life snobbery. You are an education.’ (c) Q:To be a human was to continually dumb the world down into an understandable story that keeps things simple. (c) Q:‘I have been so many things. On every continent on Earth. And yet I have never found the life for me. I am resigned to being this way for ever. There will never be a life that I truly want to live for ever. I get too curious. I get too much of a yearning to live another way. And you don’t need to make that face. It’s not sad. I am happily in limbo.’…I kind of like being a slider. I like imperfection. I like keeping death as an option. I like never having to settle.’ … You do realise there are infinite possibilities here? I mean, the multiverse isn’t about just some universes. It’s not about a handful of universes. It’s not even about a lot of universes. It’s not about a million or a billion or a trillion universes. It’s about an infinite number of universes. Even with you in them. You could be you in any version of the world, however unlikely that world would be. You are only limited by your imagination. You can be very creative with the regrets you want to undo. I once undid a regret about not doing something I’d contemplated as a teenager – doing aerospace engineering and becoming an astronaut – and so in one life I became an astronaut. I haven’t been to space. But I became someone who had been there, for a little while. The thing you have to remember is that this is an opportunity and it is rare and we can undo any mistake we made, live any life we want. Any life. Dream big . . . You can be anything you want to be. Because in one life, you are.’ (c) Q:It seems that you have spent all your life saying things that you aren’t really thinking. … The regrets she had been living with most of her life were wasted ones. (c) Q:You coughed your guts out and had hypothermia but you crossed the river, against incredible odds. You found something inside you.’‘Yes. Bacteria. I was ill for weeks. I swallowed so much of that shitty water.’ (c) Q:‘It’s an easy game to play,’ she told Nora. ‘But a hard one to master. Every move you make opens a whole new world of possibility.’ … In chess, as in life, possibility is the basis of everything. Every hope, every dream, every regret, every moment of living.’ (c)Q:He seemed like he would be able to sit in a field near Chernobyl and marvel at the beautiful scenery. (c) Q:She realised that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality. As Thoreau wrote, ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see. (c) Q:There was a net of love to break her fall. (c)"

‘Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small. But every time one decision is taken over another, the outcomes differ’
Nora is going through a pretty difficult time; she hates her work life, she has no social life and her family relationships are not what they used to be. She becomes consumed by regret over the paths she once could’ve taken but did not. Could her life has been drastically different if only she would’ve taken more/different paths in life? On a night where she decides she doesn’t want to carry on anymore, The Midnight Library presents itself and shows her what her life could’ve been.I’ve seen this everywhere for the past 6 months and seen nothing but amazing reviews for it so naturally I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it. Very grateful for my friend Dave for gifting it to me! This was definitely one of those books where you feel like you picked it up at exactly the right time; a thought provoking, funny and profound read.Although the topic of the book was quite heavy, the tone of the book was uplifting and funny therefore made it a very easy read and easier to consume the topics which were being spoken about.On a personal note, it definitely served as a reflective tool for myself. I think we all from time to time picture how different our lives could’ve been had we have done things differently and taken up different opportunities. This book really solidifies the fact that there is nothing you can do about your past, but you have every chance and opportunity for your future. Your life is a continuous blank page and you can change things at any time.
‘You don’t have to understand life, you just have to live it’
 – yeah, tell that to my overactive, philosophy loving, god fearing brain. This definitely stopped me in my tracks."
1030,4.0,"What a surprise this book turned out to be!!The Midnight Library by Matt Haig is worth the hype and read. I loved this plot about a depressed woman who lives with nothing but regrets. She decides to finally end her life one night and ends up at the Midnight Library.The Midnight Library is a place between life and death. This place will determine if you really want to live or have no hope for life in the end. It goes into different life dimensions, the regrets and all the possibilities that we could have had in a single life.The Midnight Library is part philosophy, part sci-fi and a whole lot of what ifs.Maybe you need to be in the right frame of mind to read this one? And I happened to be in that state of mind with questioning my own happiness and journey as I start the new year. It's always good to check in with yourself!Definitely read this one! I think it's worth it and really loved the whole concept of this lovely book."

I felt like the middle part was a bit mundane compared to the beginning, however it tied through at the end. I would give it a solid 3.5 :)"
1033,1.0,"Trigger warning: SuicideSo this book had me annoyed and aggravated before I fell asleep last night. I woke up this morning and started it again, and finished it in between the avalanche of meetings I have had today. I decided to post my probably going to be a scattered review since I want to just get over this book as quickly as possible. First off, Matt Haig probably without meaning to just gave a big old middle finger to people who suffer from depression and those of us still here, who have thought about committing suicide. Most of this book seems to be saying depressions is just really about regrets humans have and hey what if we made a fantastical space between death and lie and you get a chance to live every life you possibly can so that way you can see how important you are and that suicide is not the way to go. ""The Midnight Library"" follows 35 year old Nora Seed who is having a very bad day/life. Nora is stuck in a dead end job at a music store and gets sacked. Her piano student no longer needs her. A friendly guy she knows from her job finds her cat dead in the road. And when Nora finds out her brother Joe has been in town and not met up with her, she realizes he still holds a grudge against her for not fulfilling his dream of being rock stars (it's a long part of the story I refuse to relive). The book starts a countdown to when Nora will take her life. Then Nora ""wakes up"" in a place called ""The Midnight Library"" where time has stopped at 00:00 and the librarian from her childhood is there to guide Nora and show her all of her regrets and the many books(lives) she can live. We follow Nora as she gets to know more about the library, the many lives she could have lived, and the regrets she has around her parents, her best friend Izzy, her ex fiancée (who is a tool) and her brother Joe. First, depression is serious. Depression is a liar. The main character in this book, Nora, suffers from depression, but besides Haig talking about her pills and that, we don't get any sense that Nora has tried to see a therapist. There's a lot that has happened to her and based on her family history that is revealed, it sounds like Nora's mother suffer from depression and addiction issues, and we definitely know her brother does as well. I don't know. Maybe as someone who has suffered from depression I was hoping for a book that would explore that, and explore how that feels to the person in the middle of it. If Haig had shown any of Nora's lives with her getting more of a understanding besides hey apparently with no regrets things are great, and you should hold onto the life you have, because other lives may suck, I would have applauded this book.Second, the character development of several people is not there because we skip around with Nora into the many lives she gets to explore. We start to see along with her that maybe her father was a terrible damn person, that her brother was blaming her for things beyond her control, etc. but I don't know. It just felt surface level deep. The writing at times gets very repetitive and I hope you like reading the words ""root life"" because it appears a lot. I think the worst sections for me were when Nora did that stupid TED talk and made me want to scream and when she went off to be an glaciest (or whatever the word is for people who study glaciers) and pretty much met a dude who stole the idea behind what is happening to her from a tv show that I haven't thought about in years. The poems that pop up throughout also made me hard cringe, but many readers who have followed my reviews know how I feel about bad poetry. The flow is pretty bad. I think the chapter that was the worse is when we are walked through all of Nora's lives and I just did not care.The setting of the book changes a few times and I will give Haig credit. He can set a scene. It was interesting to see Nora in so many different places, countries, and going through so many experiences, he can capture the mood. The ending is pretty lackluster I thought. And honestly that was actually okay. I just maybe sighed that there is no follow-up or seemingly anything that is going to happen with Nora getting the care she needs. Apparently her ""Midnight Library"" was enough. "
1034,3.0,"This book's concept is very cool, and it kept me engaged and interested for about 2/3 of the book. I do feel like it peaked a little early so later on in the story it became a bit redundant and the charm wore off a bit. Plus the ending felt a bit rushed and tidy for a story with such deep themes and subject matter (TW: suicide). (view spoiler)[I think the way the main character is sort of 'cured' from her depression by having this experience is questionable. From what I know, the author is very pro-therapy and addressing mental health issues, but this character who suffers from depression and attempts suicide never, in her real life, gets any sort of professional help. Near the end she is hospitalized and they do an evaluation of her, but then eventually she is just discharged with no plan to move forward with any sort of help. I would've liked to see something like that mentioned! (hide spoiler)]Overall, it's a story with a good reminder to appreciate what you have because that's all you've got. It's not mind-blowingly good but it's a quick, charming read that I think would appeal to a wide variety of readers."

1036,5.0,"I don’t read many books that include a fantasy theme, but when I read the blurb for The Midnight Library, I knew I had to read it. I mean, a story about a library at the edge of the universe with an infinite number of books.....sign me up!!! I highly recommend this book to anybody that has ever wondered how their life would have been different if they had taken a different path/or made a different decision. Matt Haig is a superb storyteller and will have you hooked from beginning to end. The story reminds us to appreciate the little things in life, live without regrets and know that even the little things we do, can make a difference. Five star read for me!!"

1038,5.0,"4.5 starsSuch a great book; I love Matt Haig's writing! His writing style is great and very readable. I loved the premise of getting to go back and change the decisions in your life that you regret making. I spent a lot of time wondering what I would change if I got to go to the midnight library. I'm a bit jealous that I can't go; there are no major things that I want to change in my life but I am definitely curious what would happen if I had made another choice at certain times. I flew through this book. This was a beautiful story about regrets and not living your life based on others expectations. Maybe the things that you often regret in life are not actually the things that you should regret. There are so many other possibilities of how your life could have gone differently based on every single choice you make, that who knows if making that one seemingly better decision would have turned out any better. Nobody is happy all of the time. No matter what decisions you make in life, there will always be good times and bad times. When things are bad, it is not just your shitty life, it is life. Sounds a bit cynical but it is true, no matter what decisions you make in life it will never be good times 100 percent of the time, so there is no use in wallowing in the past. Keep moving past and the good times will come. Definitely recommend this book. I think that even the non sci-fi lovers out there would enjoy it."
1039,3.0,"3.5ish stars.Sweet, predictable, and harmless, but a little simplistic and optimistic to essentially assert that returning from the brink of suicide is as easy as ""love is all you need"" or any number of other platitudes like ""it gets better"" or ""you matter."" Because while all of those things are true and meaningful, they feel a little hollow without a transcendental transpiration to accompany them. A little wistful wishing it worked like that in real life. But the message is uplifting and I hope it hits home for someone who needs to hear it.Posted in Mr. Philip's Library"
1040,5.0,"Life can be truly wonderful, but oftentimes it isn't. Thinking about the times we are living in, perhaps many have faced and will continue to face life decisions just as Matt Haig has faced in his lifetime. Depression often rears its ugly head in all our lives but when it pitches us into times when we feel our life would be better being over, it takes on the elements of sadness, pathos, and the feeling that there is nothing to live for. This brilliant author is ever so able to handle the topic covered in this amazing book that sheds light on depression and the choices we not only make or possibly could have made in our life.Welcome to the midnight library, a place that exists in the world between life and death, where our decisions and the paths we chose not to take are explored . Would there have been a better outcome, a happier road, a brilliant future if only we had chosen one tiny different decision? Meet Nora Seed, a young woman on the brink of ending her life. She is feeling useless, depressed, despondent, morose with the thought that she needed all of this to be over. For Nora, life is no longer worth living, no longer valuable, no longer a place she wants to be. Never thinking of the existence of a library that holds every alternative path your life could have taken, she enters the midnight library where directed by a librarian she once loved and admired, Nora takes a journey down many roads not traveled to see the various ways life could have been different. Her odysseys into the ""what if"" are all varied, carrying her into the worlds she could have chosen from being an Olympic swimmer, to a glaciologist, finding love with different people, or even finding that all these choices still might not make her ultimately happy. Is her life truly doomed or is there a shred of hope that there is something, anything that really makes the life she was given worth staying around for?This thought provoking novel is intense, bringing to the forefront so many things all of us have pondered, our own ""what ifs"" of life. I particularly was drawn to the wonderful analogy Mr Haig made of life being like a chess game. Nothing changes until we make a move on the board and that move might be made in hundreds of different ways making hundreds of different happenings occur. How ultimately true how all our lives and that of our main protagonist can change with a split second decision or one that took years to form. At a time like now, where we see so much doom and gloom and where suicides are rising at such an alarming rate, this book's importance are magnified. I certainly recommend this one as Mr Haig is quickly becoming a go to author for me.Thank you to Matt Haig for opening me up to a topic I find ever so fascinating, to Canongate Books and to Edelweiss for an advanced copy of this tragic yet life affirming story due out on August 13, 2020.Jan and I were ever so happy to learn that Matt Haig had written a new book. After having read and enjoyed his How to Stop Time, we were so enthused about his new story. Happy to say we were once again ever so pleased to have been fortunate enough to be approved for this one.

1041,5.0,"“There is no rejection, there is only redirection.”This is one of those thought-provoking books that stays with you for quite some time after finishing it.The story moves quickly. Characters are interesting, and the subtle changes between lives offer some nice variation to the story. I had moderate expectations for the book and absolutely loved it.I will look for more books from this author."
1042,5.0,"“I had all the chances to make something of my life, and I blew every one of them. Through my own carelessness and misfortune, the world has retreated from me, and so now it makes perfect sense that I should retreat from the world.”Nora feels like she’s missed every opportunity in her life. She didn’t pursue singing in a band with her brother, she backed out of her wedding two days before; she never pursued any of the careers in which she wanted. She’s lost her pet, her job and even her elderly neighbor has figured out how to do without her help. She’s not needed; no one will miss her. What could there possibly be to live for? “...She realized that’s what she was. A black hole. A dying star, collapsing in on itself.”“...An unfinished jigsaw of a human. Incomplete living and incomplete dying.”“Nora went through her social media. No messages, no comments, no new followers, no friend requests. She was antimatter, with added self-pity. She went on Instagram and saw everyone had worked out how to live, except her.”If you’ve never been in a place where you’ve felt like you’ve wanted to throw in the towel, then consider yourself EXTREMELY fortunate, or maybe you just don’t suffer from depression like I do. Regardless, life is hard and sometimes it feels as if you get hit with one thing after the other and you can’t do anything right.But, on the night when Nora decides to end it all she becomes stuck in limbo between life and death. There she’s confronted with her high school librarian Mrs.Elm who allows her to pick and choose from a variety of lives in which she could have lived had she made different choices. Slowly Nora realizes that no life she enters is perfect and maybe she didn’t have it so bad after all. But will it be to late?“Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things that she wasn’t.”“Which regret stands out? Which decision would you like to undo? Which life would you like to try on?”What choices would you make differently if you could start your life all over again? If you could take a peek at the paths not taken would you? I know I would.I loved everything about this book. This was a story that I didn’t know I needed in my life and I couldn’t have read it with a greater group of people!This was our Overbooked Book Club pick for April 2021 and I’m so glad that we picked it! #overbookedbookclub #beyondoverbooked5 ⭐️"
1043,5.0,"Matt Haig's latest offering is a quirky, melancholy yet life affirming tale of regret for the roads not taken, a ""what if"" scenario that will speak in its own way to every one of us. After all we all wonder, don't we, what our lives might look like now if we'd turned left instead of right...if this thing had happened but not that thing...Caught between life and death, main protagonist Nora finds herself in a vast library, the books here are stories of her life not lived. Guided by the librarian, who reflects a part of her past, Nora tries on some of those lives for size, a process that changes her understanding of her life in many many ways..The Midnight Library is kind of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" for the modern age, written with the deep insight into certain aspects of the human condition that Matt Haig is known for, beautifully crafted and offering the reader many thought provoking idea's. It's a novel you will drift off with into thoughts of your own life decisions, whilst constantly being brought back to Nora and hers.What does a happy ending look like? Well that's the thing. It can look like many many things.The Midnight Library is beautiful. I loved every minute of it. Highly recommended."

1045,5.0,"Excellent book on a fascinating subject! Nora Seed is ready to die. She hates her life and her job and her cat just died. Suddenly she is transported to The Midnight Library where her school librarian, Mrs Elm awaits her arrival. Mrs Elm guides her in what to do next explaining that the books in this never ending library are all various versions of what her life could have been. She instructs her to find a life that she would want to live. This is where Nora’s (and the readers) life changing adventure begins. I love the concept of this book! A way to see all the ‘could of’s’. You could have been an Olympian or a rock star or the best mom ever. It also discusses how regrets can effect you life and your decisions. If you have read this book, I must ask: WHAT WOULD YOUR MIDNIGHT LIBRARY/GUIDE LOOK LIKE???I’m pretty sure mine would be a bar or a winery. Haha 😂 My guide would be ‘the most interesting man in the world’ 🤣"
1046,4.0,"CW: (view spoiler)[On page suicide attempt (hide spoiler)]Well that was quite a lovely and life affirming book.I know Nora isn't the only person out there who reflects on their life and wonders about the choices they have made, regrets missed opportunities, and yearns for more meaningful human connections. I enjoyed her journey through her other possible lives, especially the one where she is a mother. That alternate timeline hit me right in the heart.I don't have the expertise to comment on the way mental health issues are dealt with in this book and if the resolution was satisfactory. All I can say is that I came away feeling warm, happy and quite appreciative of my own life."
1047,5.0,"ARC received in exchange for an honest review. Sometimes you find a book, a really rare book, that speaks to you on a deeply personal level. The Midnight Library is that book for me. Given the opportunity, would you go back and follow a different path? Would you take up the chance to follow a different life by changing just one decision? That's the chance Nora faces in the Midnight Library. Caught somewhere between life and death, she must face all of her fears and decisions. It's a story of regrets, anxiety, loss and grief. But it might also just be about hope too. Matt Haig's battle with his own mental health has been well publicised by Matt himself, and you can see a lot of his own personal struggles within Nora. It's what makes her so real and relatable. At the start of the novel she's struggling tremendously with her mental health. In a dark hole of depression, she's struggling to get to grips with how exhausting her life is. She has no hope left, nothing to fight for. And in that moment she makes a decision, possibly her final decision, which leads her to the library. I've never fried so much as I did following Nora's story. Seeing her dreams, her changing ambitions, all while still struggling with anxiety and depression. I felt so seen as an ownvoices reader. Nora is a reflection of myself, even down to the same medications, and we both have similar thoughts of anxiety and regret. At times she's so fragile, so exposed to a world that isn't ready for her, and I felt every cautious comment and surge of hope alongside her. She's perhaps the most carefully developed and complicated character I've ever read. The secondary characters, even down to Volts the cat, share this complexity and only add to the deep well of emotions at play here. The story itself is built around Nora, and grows organically as she does. Her journeys to different lives become more strange and extreme as Nora changes, and with each life we learn something new about her. I think my favourite life is her time spent with an equally mysterious traveller in a chilly climate - who opens up Nora to a completely different way of experiencing life. That said, every experience Nora has feels important and relevant to the plot. No sentence is wasted in showing us Nora's worlds and the potential she has. It's a potential we all have, but it can be difficult to find when were cut down by inner thoughts and demons. I don't think I could profess enough about how much I love this book. It's become a new all-time favourites and I can't thank Matt Haig enough for so perfectly capturing my own mental health issues in a character that is instantly relatable and complicated. "
1048,4.0,"This book. Especially in these times. This book. Like a little cocoon of warmth in the stormy evening. Akin to a genuine hug amid the phoney social circles. A love story with self. A cascade of calm.The Midnight Library, at its core, is a testament to the inherent goodness in every life; only, it is narrated in a fantastical way, a way beyond life and little short of death, because unless we are shown something otherworldly, we don’t appreciate the commonplace. Just like Nora. Until she became privy to multiple lives – that of an Olympian Swimmer and a Rockstar, a Glaciologist and an Academician – she didn’t comprehend what lay sealed in the recesses of her heart. A mute, expectant love, waiting to spread wings and overwhelm Nora’s being. 
And when she thought of her root life, the fundamental problem with it, the thing that had left her vulnerable, really, was the absence of love.
 The Midnight Library and its librarian, the endearing and wise, Mrs. Elm, provided Nora a chance to relive a life she was (nearly) done with; a cycle that she had the power to manoeuvre in any direction she wished. And chances she did take. Hopping into multiple bodies and slipping into different emotions made her more conscious of what she had left behind, like succumbing to an acute yearning for home when one is travelling, even conquering, the world. 
A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.
 And worthwhile it was. To know that I was capable. To know that fumbles are normal. To know that deluges pass too. To know that friends are just a word away. To know that the whole city of life is dotted with trees of kindness that pop up at every corner to provide shade even when I am not looking for them. This library. Especially in these times. This library. Get in. And tell me when you find your Mrs. Elm.--

“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”
representation: depression and anxiety (own voices), brief mentions of characters of colour, gay side character.[trigger warnings are listed at the bottom of this review and may contain spoilers]★★★★★This book has completely solidified the fact that Matt Haig is one of my favourite authors of all time. When I read his books, I feel SEEN. Like, someone gets me. Like I'm not alone. I don't even know what to say. This was just absolutely extraordinary and spoke to me on such a deep level. I remember a time when I didn't want to live either, and wow if I had read this back then, it would have meant everything to me (let's be real, it still means everything to me.) The parts about motherhood especially touched me, there's truly no other love like it. It was also just so fun to read about all her other potential lives, I couldn't put it down! It was just so interesting while also pulling on my heartstrings, for sure! trigger warnings: death of a pet, suicide and suicide ideation, loss of a parent (cancer), loss of a parent (heart attack), cheating, drug use, loss of sibling (overdose). "
1050,5.0,"The beginning of the book worried me. The constant negative self-talk was getting too much to read, but it set the stage for Nora's state of mind and depression. Luckily, after that, the rest of the book is a lot more enjoyable to read.I love so many things about this book. I can't say that Nora was an explicitly likable character, but she serves her purpose for the storyline and Matt Haig's concept in an enjoyable to read manner. I have always been intrigued by the universe of possibilities and the concept of parallel lives. Haig did a superb job exploring these through Nora and her book of regrets.Some of my favorite quotes: ""Nora shook her head, wishing it would fall off, onto the floor so she would never have to have a conversation with a stranger again.""""She was a waterfall of apologies. She was drowning in them.""""She had shrunk for him, but he still hadn't found the space he needed.""""A thing I have learned (written by a nobody who has been everybody)It is easy to mourn the lives we aren’t living. Easy to wish we’d developed other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we’d worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee, or done more bloody yoga.It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn’t make and the work we didn’t do and the people we didn’t marry, and the children we didn’t have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret and keepregretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out.But it is not the lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It’s the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people’s worst enemy.We can’t tell if any of those other versions would have been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.Of course, we can’t visit every place or meet every person or do every job, yet most of what we’d feel in any life is still available. We don’t have to play every game to know what winning feels like. We don’t have to hear every piece of music in the world to understand music. We don’t have to have tried every variety of grape from every vineyard to know the pleasure of wine. Love and laughter and fear and pain are universal currencies.We just have to close our eyes and savour the taste of the drink in front of us and listen to the song as it plays. We are as completely and utterly alive as we are in any other life and have access to the same emotional spectrum.We only need to be one person.We only need to feel one existence.We don’t have to do everything in order to be everything, because we arealready infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility.So let’s be kind to the people in our own existence. Let’s occasionally look upfrom the spot in which we are because, wherever we happen to be standing, the sky above goes on for ever.""4.5 stars"

1055,4.0,"“The Midnight Library” begins with our main character, Nora Seed, wanting to die. The straw that broke the camel’s back is when her beloved feline, Volts, dies. She previously lost her job at a music store, her brother hates her, and she’s lost touch with her BFF. She’s just fed up with life; she’s full of despair. As the story begins, she takes all her anti-depressants…. but wakes up!In a weird Library with what appears to be millions of books in copious amounts of bookshelves that seem to go on forever. She finds her primary school librarian, Mrs. Elm. Mrs. Elm explains to Nora and the reader that Nora is very lucky, and she’s given the chance to do some “do-overs” in her life. Nora is overwhelmed with this idea, and Mrs. Elm starts with “The book of regrets”. Author Matt Haig’s new novel ponders the idea of parallel universes and quantum physics. This is a meditation on the millions of different choices we all make in our lives that make the events of our lives occur. Say, instead of going to work, you chose to take the day off and go to the beach. There is a universe where one of you went to the beach and one of you went to work, with different life outcomes occurring. In the Midnight Library, Nora can pick a time and do her life differently. So in this magical moment, when Nora is not alive and not dead, in her case it’s midnight, she is in a suspended place where she can review where her life went wrong or what she could have done differently.She’s encouraged by Mrs. Elm to sample different lives. To go into them and see if they felt more authentic or were what she wanted out of life. Interestingly, there are the same characters in many of her lives. But the character’s fortunes are sometime different. In one her brother is dead; another he’s successful. In one her mother is dead, and in another she’s alive. It’s similar to “It’s a Wonderful Life” in that she does see the value she adds to others in some of her lives.I enjoyed the idea of the novel. I liked that it made me think about what my “book of regrets” could be. It was a refreshing look at how others are responsible for their own lives. And, there is a bit of fate in it: no matter what you did, X occurred. And I have thought about parallel universes and what a different “me” could be doing right now. Given our turbulent reality with the virus and political divisiveness, this was a refreshing read."

Another undisputable FAV for all eternity! This book needs to be pill-packaged and sold to depressed people worldwide!Herewith I'm proclaiming my eternal love of all things Matt Haig. For one thing, it's about a LIBRARY! For another it's a parallel world library, with books being the portals to parallel worlds! Considering that I've just read another great book with parallel world setting in place (The Space Between Worlds!), I'm loving every second of it.Yet another thing to love is this: Matt Haig, being Matt Haig, just couldn't write a regular world-jumping book and be done with it. It had to be set in just the way to be conductive to be therapeutic to the readers. Maybe I'll just eat this book to get the most benefits from it :) They need to package it and sell as antidepressant pills!We start at a library and wind up with Nora Seed working for 12 years at a bookshop, String Theory. At 30 she's still there, with a Degree in Philosophy and a cat that has just died. Then our Nora goes on a tour-de-force through parallel lives. In most she leaves a mess behind: in Australia, I think, she loses a job, in the Olympic life - she leaves behind a mess of a mangled speech, a row with Dan, a 'disastrous rendition of Chopin’s Piano Concerto No. 2 at the Finlandia Hall in Helsinki'… And sliding out while having sex?I've 1 world-building question here: was it midnight in the Library or wasn't it? If it was and the time actually was stopped then why the tremors, in the real life during that minute there should've been no new developments with Nora. She gets fired in the most ludicrous way I've ever heard of:Q:It’s just that when times are tough I can’t pay you to put off customers with your face looking like a wet weekend.’‘What?' (c) Right, WHAT the hell? And she has the most ridiculous talks with people around:Q:‘Nora Seed?’...‘Yep.’‘I’m Kerry-Anne. Remember you from school. The swimmer. Super-brain. Didn’t whatshisface, Mr Blandford, do an assembly on you once? Said you were going to end up at the Olympics?’...‘So, did you?’‘I, um, gave it up. Was more into music . . . at the time. Then life happened.’‘So what do you do now?’‘I’m . . . between things.’‘Got anyone, then? Bloke? Kids?’Nora shook her head. ...‘Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock.’ (c) Drat. What an enlightening discussion.She's a philosopher to the boot:Q:‘Go confidently in the direction of your dreams,’ Thoreau had said. ‘Live the life you’ve imagined.’Thoreau had been her favourite philosopher to study. But who seriously goes confidently in the direction of their dreams? Well, apart from Thoreau. He’d gone and lived in the woods, with no contact from the outside world, to just sit there and write and chop wood and fish. (c) Q:At university she had done an essay drily titled ‘The Principles of Hobbesian Memory and Imagination’. Thomas Hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing, and since discovering that she had never entirely trusted her memories. (c) Q:She remembered studying Aristotle as a first-year Philosophy student. And being a bit depressed by his idea that excellence was never an accident. That excellent outcomes were the result of ‘the wise choice of many alternatives’. And here she was, in the privileged position of being able to sample these many alternatives. It was a shortcut to wisdom and maybe a shortcut to happiness too. She saw it now not as a burden but a gift to be cherished. (c) Q:‘Life begins,’ Sartre once wrote, ‘on the other side of despair.’ (c)She's also a Q: Swimmer. Musician. Philosopher. Spouse. Traveller. Glaciologist. Happy. Loved. (c) All failed. She's also Q:a rock star, an Olympian, a music teacher, a primary school teacher, a professor, a CEO, a PA, a chef, a glaciologist, a climatologist, an acrobat, a tree-planter, an audit manager, a hair-dresser, a professional dog walker, an office clerk, a software developer, a receptionist, a hotel cleaner, a politician, a lawyer, a shoplifter, the head of an ocean protection charity, a shop worker (again), a waitress, a first-line supervisor, a glass-blower and a thousand other things… (c)So, she gets to the Midnight Library which is an infinitely large library of all books of all possible lives of Nora. Her old librarian, Mrs Elm, is charoning her around. (I do think that Mrs Elm is just a figment of Nora's imagination, a brain trying to explain things in user-friendly terms and to introduce something known into the vastness of unknown between lives or even worlds. Hugo insisted that Mrs Elm and Philippe are interpretations.). Q:I see a simplified version of the truth. The librarian is just a kind of mental metaphor. The whole thing is. (c)The Midnight Library:Q:Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’ (c) Q:‘Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small. But every time one decision is taken over another, the outcomes differ. An irreversible variation occurs, which in turn leads to further variations. These books are portals to all the lives you could be living.’ (c)Q:‘Librarians have knowledge. They guide you to the right books. The right worlds. They find the best places. Like soul-enhanced search engines.’ (c)The quantum discussion (where would we be without it?):Q:‘Erwin Schrödinger . . .’‘He of the cat.’‘Yes. The cat guy. He said that in quantum physics every alternative possibility happens simultaneously. All at once. In the same place. Quantum superposition. The cat in the box is both alive and dead. You could open the box and see that it was alive or dead, that’s how it goes, but in one sense, even after the box is open, the cat is still both alive and dead. Every universe exists over every other universe. Like a million pictures on tracing paper, all with slight variations within the same frame. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics suggests there are an infinite number of divergent parallel universes. Every moment of your life you enter a new universe. With every decision you make. And traditionally it was thought that there could be no communication or transference between those worlds, even though they happen in the same space, even though they happen literally millimetres away from us.’ (c) Q:‘What if there are more than two roads diverging in the wood? What if there are more roads than trees? What if there is no end to the choices you could make? What would Robert Frost do then?’ (c) Q:She learned that undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true. There was almost any life she was living in one universe, after all. (c)Q:Going for a coffee with Ash might have led, for instance, to Nora falling in love with the person serving the coffee. That was simply the unpredictable nature of quantum physics. (c)The empowering things:Q:Every second of every day we are entering a new universe. And we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad. …it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. …But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in. (c)Q:‘You need to realise something if you are ever to succeed at chess,’ she said, as if Nora had nothing bigger to think about. ‘And the thing you need to realise is this: the game is never over until it is over. It isn’t over if there is a single pawn still on the board. If one side is down to a pawn and a king, and the other side has every player, there is still a game. And even if you were a pawn – maybe we all are – then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary but it isn’t. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.’ (c)Q:Fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut. Despair was when the door closed and locked behind you.But with every life she saw that metaphorical door widen a little further as she grew better at using her imagination. (c) Q:She could have been all those amazing things, and that wasn’t depressing, as she had once thought. Not at all. It was inspiring. Because now she saw the kinds of things she could do when she put herself to work. … What sometimes feels like a trap is actually just a trick of the mind. … She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. (c)Q:We don’t have to do everything in order to be everything, because we are already infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility. (c) Q:… life sometimes simply gave you a whole new perspective by waiting around long enough for you to see it. (c)Sliders are a hoot, aren't they?Q:‘I’m sorry,’ his other self said, as he sipped his wine and the sun set behind him, ‘I’ve forgotten who you are.’‘Don’t worry,’ she said. ‘So have I.’ (c)Other fun stuff:Q:Ever cleaned pub toilets, Nora?’‘I’m having a pretty shit time too, if we’re doing the Misery Olympics.’ (c)Q:‘It was a lot of pressure.’‘Pressure makes us, though. You start off as coal and the pressure makes you a diamond.’ (c) Q:Every move had been a mistake, every decision a disaster, every day a retreat from who she’d imagined she’d be. …She knew only one thing with absolute certainty: she didn’t want to reach tomorrow. (c)Q:‘You don’t go to death. Death comes to you.’Even death was something Nora couldn’t do properly, it seemed. (c) Q:Did you do anything wrong?’That was an easy one. ‘Yes. Absolutely everything.’ (c)Q:… while most people were into rock music you were into actual rocks and stuff.’ (c)Q:You have yourself in quite high esteem there, Nora.’‘Shouldn’t I? I mean, shouldn’t everyone? What’s wrong with self-esteem? (c) Q:I have carefully calculated that the pain of me living as the bloody disaster that is myself is greater than the pain anyone else will feel if I were to die. In fact, I’m sure it would be a relief. (c) Q:She wondered how many Dans there were in the world, dreaming of things they would hate if they actually got them. And how many were pushing other people into their delusional idea of happiness? (c) Q:‘Interesting. I had no idea there was such a thing as between-life snobbery. You are an education.’ (c) Q:To be a human was to continually dumb the world down into an understandable story that keeps things simple. (c) Q:‘I have been so many things. On every continent on Earth. And yet I have never found the life for me. I am resigned to being this way for ever. There will never be a life that I truly want to live for ever. I get too curious. I get too much of a yearning to live another way. And you don’t need to make that face. It’s not sad. I am happily in limbo.’…I kind of like being a slider. I like imperfection. I like keeping death as an option. I like never having to settle.’ … You do realise there are infinite possibilities here? I mean, the multiverse isn’t about just some universes. It’s not about a handful of universes. It’s not even about a lot of universes. It’s not about a million or a billion or a trillion universes. It’s about an infinite number of universes. Even with you in them. You could be you in any version of the world, however unlikely that world would be. You are only limited by your imagination. You can be very creative with the regrets you want to undo. I once undid a regret about not doing something I’d contemplated as a teenager – doing aerospace engineering and becoming an astronaut – and so in one life I became an astronaut. I haven’t been to space. But I became someone who had been there, for a little while. The thing you have to remember is that this is an opportunity and it is rare and we can undo any mistake we made, live any life we want. Any life. Dream big . . . You can be anything you want to be. Because in one life, you are.’ (c) Q:It seems that you have spent all your life saying things that you aren’t really thinking. … The regrets she had been living with most of her life were wasted ones. (c) Q:You coughed your guts out and had hypothermia but you crossed the river, against incredible odds. You found something inside you.’‘Yes. Bacteria. I was ill for weeks. I swallowed so much of that shitty water.’ (c) Q:‘It’s an easy game to play,’ she told Nora. ‘But a hard one to master. Every move you make opens a whole new world of possibility.’ … In chess, as in life, possibility is the basis of everything. Every hope, every dream, every regret, every moment of living.’ (c)Q:He seemed like he would be able to sit in a field near Chernobyl and marvel at the beautiful scenery. (c) Q:She realised that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality. As Thoreau wrote, ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see. (c) Q:There was a net of love to break her fall. (c)"
1058,4.0,"3.5 stars rounded up A nice idea for a book. I enjoyed reading this one. It was a bit depressing at times, but overall had a lot of good life messages about being both grateful and optimistic. Nora Seed finds herself discontented with her life. She is at a low point and questions how to move forward. Her cat dies, her parents have passed away, she is at a falling out with her brother, her best friend moved away, and she is having trouble being enthusiastic at her job at a music store. She becomes depressed, and she decides to end her life. After overdosing, she wakes up at The Midnight Library, a place between life and death where she can look at all of her life’s regrets and get the chance to live other lives where she had chosen different paths. If she is happy in a new life, she can chose to stay, otherwise she’ll come back to The Midnight Library to try again. Nora goes to these different lives only to find that they aren’t as great as she imagined. Something she once took for granted in her original life is taken away in the new life. She sees that in many of her lives she is quite a different individual. I had trouble believing that she would be that different in each life. Your choices do affect you, but I don’t think who you are at your core alters much. I liked how Nora realized her deep desire to live. She became more optimistic about her original life. She got to see how her seemingly small actions are meaningful and positively affect others, the ripple effect. (: She also realized that happiness is a deliberate choice, rather than a result. I liked Nora’s character and her growth. She was relatable and cared about doing the right thing. This book explores the question of how would your life turn out if you had made a difference choice. Would you be happier? It is about the what-ifs and all the various lives you could have lived had you fully pursued other careers, hobbies, or relationships. This books gives the message that the grass isn’t necessarily greener on the other side, but rather where you water it. It also makes you appreciate all of the good things that you have and that go right in your life. It shows though we always wonder what could have been, one can only make the best decision with all the information you have at the time. This book was at times melancholy, but overall I found it inspiring that the possibilities are truly endless. There is always something to grateful for and something worth exploring, because you never know what it could lead to."
1059,4.0,"this book is a therapy session between pages. matt haig literally takes on the most extensive topics like life decisions, regrets, and parallel universes, and does it with incredible tact.it follows a woman named nora who is especially unhappy with her current life situation and finds no fulfillment in anything. events pass that make her find herself in a library suspended between time with endless books, each containing another life she can slip into.each new life nora gets to experience in these parallel universes leaves her with a new, deeper understanding of life, choice, and her personal regrets. i personally thought this book wrecked my life because wow did i feel DUMB when the parallel universe/science-y stuff came into play. matt haig's brain is so powerful to encompass all this philosophical information and then put it into coherent thoughts!!! i could never!! 
""What do I do now?"" ""You open the book and turn to the first page.""
on a personal level, i really enjoyed this book. like the conversations it brought up felt like it was JUST PERFECT for my current life state. it made me think so deeply about so many topics especially on making choices and feeling regretthere were many moments of this book that felt repetitive to me and yes, i guess that's the whole point of parallel universe realities but there were times i felt it was hard to keep reading and easy to put it downthe ending of the book was amazing!!! the perfect ending to nora's story!! any other ending would have left me with endless disappointment so im glad matt haig pulled through.i'm definitely going to pick up the author's other books bc he is clearly incredibly smart and talented and knows how to give me a proper existential crisis

1060,3.0,"5 stars for the concept.3 stars for the development.Brief published in the NY Times: “Nora Seeds finds a library beyond the edge of the universe that contains books with multiple possibilities of the lives one could have lived.”Isn’t that a terrific premise?I loved the concept. And I wanted so badly to love this book. So many raving reviews. I even gave this book full priority over all the other books that I acquired before.I’m feeling extremely disappointed. There are some good moments with very interesting/smart (but sometimes cheesy) dialogues.The writing wasn’t really that gripping or exciting. I thought that there was a lack of depth and I did not connect with the main character. The second half of the book was better than the first.I wanted Nora to be unique and special but when I realized that she was just “another one” I almost quit the book. I can’t go in details here, as I would spoil the book for some readers.Please, don’t make my disappointment stop you from reading this work, as there is a big chance that you may love it. "
1061,4.0,"Earlier this year, I whittled my mountainous TBR to a tolerable level, and then I went on an adding binge for all the 2020 books I'd considered but never decided on. The Midnight Library by Matt Haig is one of those books, and when it became available through the NY Public Library (I'd been on a waiting list for months) last week, I accepted the offer and dived in that night. For the most part, it's a contemporary fiction novel in which a character explores the different roads she could've taken had she made alternative decisions. While it's deemed part fantasy/sci-fi, it's really not... this is more about the emotional connections and understandings of a young woman who's considering suicide as a way to end her pain.Nora Seed was once a competitive swimmer but gave it up. She had love in parts of her life, but lost it. She had friends and a good life but walked away. She had a bad relationship with her family but tried to mend it. Everything she attempted seemed to fail, and one day, she decides life isn't right for her. When she passes over to an unknown place, Nora learns she hasn't quite died yet. It's midnight, and she has an opportunity to look at different lives she could've had... except there's a twist -- it's through books with a familiar librarian. She might only have enough time to see one or it could be thousands. And if she dies in one of those lives in the moment she chooses to witness, her life is definitely over. So much to consider here... and I really enjoyed all her exploration.I'm not gonna comment in detail on the way suicide is handled in this book. I know it's bugged some readers, and perhaps it's viewed as sharing the wrong messages. I don't think that's at all an easy topic and there will always be tons of opinions. To me, this is purely one person's experience, and I respect the way the story is told. There are reasons why it works; there are reasons why it's too fluffy. But the key for me is the trajectory of Nora's emotions as she visits each life. I adored the movie 'Defending Your Life' for the same reasons as I very much connected with this book. The ability to discover what happens in your own life when you're not looking closely enough is sheer beauty.I think this will work even better as a movie, as the visual effects of the library and its destruction will be amazing. Having a few key character relationships will tug at our hearts. I would definitely read more by this author. I recommend this for readers who enjoy time travel (but not purely for the scientific aspects of it) and who aren't triggered by anything related to suicide or thoughts of harming oneself. Those items withstanding, it's compelling and rich with thought-provoking concepts."
1062,5.0,"I'll be honest, I have Matt Haig's previous book How to Stop Time sitting on my shelf and I wasn't in a rush to read it. Well after reading The Midnight Library I can tell you I will now be rushing to read it ASAP! This book was the most heartwarming and emotional read that I have gotten to in a while, and I loved it so much. I was in a crunch for time, so I listened to the audio, and Carey Mulligan has easily made it onto the list of one of my favorite narrators, just with this book! She was the absolute perfect Nora, and I loved the fact she was so easy to understand even with her accent. Now I just need her to narrate more books!The Midnight Library is an enchanting, and sometimes sad, story about a woman who has decided she wants to die only to end up in the Midnight Library with her old school librarian, Mrs. Elm. Here she gets the opportunity to experience other possibilities in other lives she could have had, to figure out if she actually wants to be dead or if life is worth continuing to be lived. Clearly that in itself is heartbreaking, but her journey as she tours pieces of these other lives was thought-provoking, unique, and makes us as the reader appreciate the life we have. This book could have been depressing and awful, but instead it is a masterpiece that deserves to be read by everyone.I read The Midnight Library as part of a group/buddy read and I think it will make for a wonderful discussion so I could easily see it being a great choice for book clubs. I loved Nora and many of the other characters, and even though it is a short book it really packs an emotional punch. It was also a very quick read so you could easily read this in one sitting. The Midnight Library is definitely going to make my list of top books for the year, and I highly recommend it if you are a fan of magical realism and books that make you think."
1063,1.0,"This is not a special book. In fact, it's the most stereotypical book about suicide and depression I've ever read. Everyone loves this and says this is a masterpiece. Let me show you my opinion.You meet Nora, a twenty-something who has problems that strangely emerge all on one day. She doesn't talk to her brother (because he must act like a stupid child), her parents are dead and that's... that's about it. But she is (so we're told) very bright and reads Voltaire and National Geographic and god knows what else. Then the sci-fi part begins. She ends up at this library and she has the possibility of trying any life she wants. And so she does exactly that - which feels EXACTLY like watching someone else's holiday photos. Boring, a bit embarrassing, repetitive and pointless. Huge lack in character development. And the ENDING. I could not deal with this most lazy, stereotypical ending ever.---------------- SPOILER ------------------------Exactly what I hate :) . All problems of hers miraculously disappear and she learns life is fucking amazing. And poof, depression disappears too. The end."
1064,4.0,"Letto tutto d’un fiato. “La biblioteca di mezzanotte” è un libro che ci fa realizzare quanto i rimpianti appesantiscano le nostre vite quando in realtà hanno meno peso di quello che pensiamo.È anche un libro che parla di come a volte scegliamo delle strade perché sono quelle che altri hanno scelto per noi ma non quelle che desideriamo veramente.Il tutto narrato con un senso di umanità che solo Matt Haig sa rendere in modo così naturale e toccante allo stesso tempo. Consigliato se amate i libri su “cosa sarebbe successo se”, se invece non avete apprezzato altri libri di Haig prima anche questo non fa per voi."
1065,3.0,"CW for suicidal ideationNora Seed decides to die but wakes up in a strange library where she can try out ""books"" of her life, all the roads not taken. For me, this fizzled out on the central concept and the author didn't take the opportunities he created for himself, preferring instead to tell a tale with a moral. Others seem to be experiencing more pleasure in their reading so don't decide anything from my comments. Also he's a UK author so maybe this is one of those ""UK funny but Jenny doesn't get it"" novels.I had a copy of the novel from the publisher through Edelweiss; it came out September 29th."
1066,4.0,"Inspiring, devastating, beautiful and eye-opening, The Midnight Library is a magical ride through a life as worth living as any other that one could imagine. The life of someone in whose shoes we've all walked in once or twice, as we imagine/hope/wish/want to find that other parallel universe in which we're somehow happier and better than we are in our current one. Or so we think we might be. While the whole time our best life is right ahead of us.Sprinkled with a lovely dose of philosophy, this book was a bittersweet joy to read."

1069,2.0,"Ich habe Redebedarf. Der Grundgedanke dieses Buches ist schön, die Message dahinter gut gemeint und der Anfang kommt vielversprechend daher... Doch dann versagt das Buch auf ganzer Linie. Es wird repetetiv und zu 100% vorhersehbar. Im ernst jetzt, zwei Drittel dieses Buches sind nach dem gleichen Schema abgelaufen, welches man nur allzu schnell durchschaut hat. Null Überraschungen. Das war alles nur ein Sammelsurium aus gängigen ""Ist das Leben nicht schön""-Klischees. Dazu kommt die Message und die ach so poethischen philosophischen Gedanken, die dem Leser mit dem Holzhammer eingebläut werden. Subtilität geht anders. An Plattheit ist dieses Buch definitiv nicht zu überbieten. Schade!"
1070,3.0,"It was …..alright I suppose.I followed the hype, not usually a thing I do. I wanted to give Matt Haig another go. I don’t think this author and I are a match. The story is ok, I get it. It’s written well, I listened to this thinking if I put my physical book down and change to audio I might like it more. It didn’t happen unfortunately. It was too pie in the sky for me. If this happened or that, nice concept but beggered belief for me. I’m in the minority I know."

1072,5.0,Read this because I saw the BTS members reading it and well why the hell not?No words can describe how much I adored this book. It felt like a nice warm hug that I did not want to end. So friking beautiful.
1073,3.0,"3.5 stars. (I’ve noticed this to be an unpopular opinion and no disrespect to anyone who thoroughly enjoyed it! Just not for me.)I was beyond hyped to finally get my hands on this book (after being on a waiting list of 60 people at the library 😂) and opened it as soon as I got home from picking it up! It started off holding my attention and keeping me thoroughly interested but somewhere around the middle, things started falling flat. I was curious to read about such a tough topic and how the author was going to go about said topic. I loved the idea of it. The message is great in some ways! Essentially, stop thinking: ‘It would have been better if...’. Suicide is definitely a tricky topic to address especially with the potential for triggering readers and I applaud the author on having the courage to write about such topics. Here’s what bugged me...Why is it that no matter what the main character did she was always a professional? The list goes on! Not once did it say that she tried something and failed. Everything was Olympian, Glaciologist in National Geographic, incredibly successful singer in a band, and later in the book as it talks about her different lives she lived there were a million more professional things she did like acrobatics in Cirque du Soleil??? In my personal life experience, I have tried many things that I’m good at and many things I’m not so good at (guitar is not my forte). Why weren’t there any examples where she tried and failed at something or was even just mediocre? Mediocrity is okay, in fact I feel it sends a wrong message to people that struggle with the thought of suicide in a sense of ‘Look how much cool stuff you could have done and been and you wouldn’t have failed as badly as you have in this life.’ Wtf is that??That’s honestly my hugest complaint with this story which is why I rated it a 3. I wanted to love this book and at times I felt is was engaging and fun and a bit of a heartstrings tugger. I just didn’t feel connected to this book like I really wanted to be. Again, I can’t stress enough that I’ve had friends who have ADORED this book so 0 disrespect if you love(d) it."
1074,4.0,"4.5 stars, loved it! The only thing I really wish for is some more! I loved this deep dive into Nora and her journey to become her most authentic self. After attempting suicide, Nora is transported to The Midnight Library. Through this magical library, she is able to look at her regrets and attempt to find the life where she feels like she fits and is at peace. Like Anxious People, I felt this book deep into my own soul. It is a lesson for everyone about how to embrace life and make the most of every opportunity, no matter how big or small. There are things you can choose and things you can't, but drowning in regret is not the answer. I also loved how you never really know how the things you do in your life that you consider ""small"" might be gigantic in the lives of others. One of the portions I highlighted:“If you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail. Aim to be you. Aim to look and act and think like you. Aim to be the truest version of you. Embrace that you-ness. Endorse it. Love it. Work hard at it. And don't give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it. Most gossip is envy in disguise.”The Midnight Library is the type of book that people will either connect with or they won't, depending on their stage of life. I thoroughly connected with it and it inspired me to treat myself more kindly and to focus less on regrets from the past and to boldly move forward. I listened to this partially as an audiobook (narrated by Carey Mulligan) and I also voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book. All opinions are my own."

1076,3.0,"Впервые читала мотивационный роман, который, возможно, стоило бы назвать «Не верь, не бойся и ни сы», но в нем есть какие-то вполне себе новогодние калории. Одной женщине после смерти дали пожить разные варианты ее жизни, и выяснилось, что она везде – унылое говно на антидепрессантах, кроме того случая, когда ее хотел задрать медведь, то есть, когда у нее появились реальные проблемы. "
1077,4.0,"Inbetween life and death lies the Midnight Library. Maybe it is a coffee shop, or a video game store, or an arcade for you, but, for Nora Seed, it is a library. Her library is made of endless shelves featuring endless tomes and each of these feature a version of her life she has yet to live. Every decision made and every decision not made resulted in another version of her life to be created and assigned a spot inside the library's vast walls. Now, all that is left for Nora to do, is sample some of them.This had such an interesting concept and proved as heart-wrenching as it was life-affirming. Nora was an individual suffering under tough mental strain, struggling with finding her place in the world, and seemingly unable to muster any good thoughts, which resulted in her depressive state leeching out onto the page and making this a book I had to consume in small increments. This is a testament to Haig's writing, that I felt I could so closely resemble Nora and feel her emotions as my own, but is something to be wary of when going in.Her exploration of the limitless lives quickly transformed these early emotions into ones far more convoluted. As Nora started to find her true self this early sadness did not dissipate, but it became mixed with every other spectrum of emotion a human can feel. It opened up hope, alongside anger, and grief, mingled with moments of happiness. Haig showed us, in just a few pages, again and again, what it is to be alive.Haig's acute observations into the nature of mental health and the internal struggles many of us feel lead this to be a thoughtful and sensitive read, but it also becomes one which increasingly let the sunshine in, leaving me in floods of happy tears at the close of it."

OMG!!!! Biden/Harris won! 

Sorry/Not Sorry about the non-book commentary, but I've been obsessing and it's wonderful to have some good news, for a change. Back to the book.Could've, should've, would've, what-ifs - sum up this novel.Are you even a human if you don't have any regrets?Depressed, directionless, lonely thirty-five-year-old Nora Seed decides to end it all.She finds herself in a kind of limbo, the midnight library, where she gets to try on different lives, paths etc.It's a cute concept, a quick read. It didn't quite hit me in the guts/feels and didn't have much depth, but I appreciated it for its uplifting, albeit simplistic, message - you keep going. "
1079,4.0,"‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.’Fascinating! I have always been intrigued by the idea of ‘parallel universe’/alternate realities and this novel brought them to life in a way that was well developed and easy to follow. I loved being able to ride-along with Nora while she navigated her way through her other realities. Even though I guessed the ultimate outcome, it really was a thought provoking journey. In the end it makes you appreciate the life choices we’ve made that have led us to the life we’re living and how the slightest deviation could’ve changed everything. 4 stars. ‘Sometimes regrets aren’t based on fact at all. Sometimes regrets are just . . . a load of bullshit.’"

1081,4.0,"A poignant, intriguing and thought-provoking book of self-discovery.SUMMARYHave you ever been to the Midnight Library? It’s the library of your life that exists at the moment between life and death. It contains the story of your life as well as an infinite number of books for how your life would have been for each different decision you could have made in your life Nora Seed’s life has been full of pain, sorrow and regrets. She no longer wants to live. And it is then that she finds herself in the Midnight Library. She now has a chance to perhaps find, and even live, a better life.The books in the Midnight Library enable Nora to drop in on her alternate lives had she made different decisions. She can now undo every one of her regrets and missed opportunities as she tries to find her perfect life. But what exactly does a perfect life look like. Things aren’t exactly what Nora imagined they’d be when different decisions are made. “If you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail. Aim to be you. Aim to look and act and think like you and to be the truest version of you. Embrace that you-ness. Endorse it. Love it. Work hard at it. And don’t give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it. Most gossip is envy in disguise.”REVIEWThe Midnight Library is a unique, inventive and thought-provoking story. Have you ever asked yourself, “what if I had done this or that differently, I wonder...?” That’s exactly what Nora gets to see. But first Nora has to get over her regrets before she can even imagine a different life. It is unsettling and painful to watch Nora’s downward spiral but interesting to watch her try to figure out her life, and who she wants to be. The Midnight Library is a poignant, intriguing and thought-provoking book. And to top it off it’s set in a library! And who of us does not love not a library. The Midnight Library serves as a great reminder that no one has a perfect life. There will be disappointments, and bad things are going to happen, but it is also possible there will also be joy and happiness just around the next corner. It is what we do in the face of adversity that defines us. The Midnight Library was written by Matt Haig who has suffered from depression and thoughts of suicide. In 2015, Haig wrote the bestselling book Reasons to Stay Alive after walking away from a suicide attempt sixteen years earlier. His writing is definitely informed, and highly readable. I listen to an audio version of the book and appreciated the performance. “We only need to be one person. We only need to feel one existence. We don’t have to do everything in order to be everything, because we are already infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility.”Publisher 	 VikingPublished 	September 29, 2020Narrated	Carey MulliganReview	www.bluestockingreviews.com"
1082,5.0,"This book and this review contain potentially triggering content.Trigger Warnings: suicidal ideation and attempted suicide, self-harm, loss of a loved one, animal death, severe depressionWhen Nora, a woman with depression and suicidal ideation, finds her life is falling apart as one thing after another seems to go wrong, she decides the world would be better off without her. But between life and death, there is a library. A library with shelves that go on forever, books full of the infinite possibilities of her life. And a librarian she recognizes who is ready to lead the way.As someone who has suffered from depression and loved people whose lives have been touched by suicide, the Midnight Library hit very close to home. I, too, have a book of regrets. Choices I wish I could undo. Lives I wish I could have lived. While I am lucky enough to have carved out a happy life where I feel loved and valued, not everyone is so fortunate. If my twenties had progressed differently, I could very well have ended up in a very similar situation to Nora, and I could relate to her on a visceral level.This book explores a difficult topic with clarity and hope, and leaves the reader with nugget after nugget of wisdom to digest. Questioning the nature of memory, challenging our expectations, interrogating our definition of a ""good"" or ""purposeful"" life, and reminding us that fulfilling our dreams is never a one-way ticket to everlasting happiness, Haig reminds us that the grass isn't always greener and that sometimes all we need is a slight shift in perspective.Beautifully crafted, touching, and inspiring, The Midnight Library is well worth your time.VIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/ERIVDkarlUYYou can find me on...Youtube | Instagram | Twitter*PBB Book Club Selection for January 2021*"
1083,2.0,"This is going to sound weird, but this book was too optimistic for my tastes. Had I read it at a different time of my life, a time when I looked at the world around me with gleeful eyes, then maybe I would have liked it better.To be fair, I really loved the protagonist. She's the type of female character I want to see represented more in the media. Her character possessed so much depth, and earlier in the book, a lot of potential too. But when I finished reading this, I had the same feeling of disappointment that often washes over me when I watch movies with 'strong' female characters that for half of the movie do not want to have any kids, but end up with a dozen of them anyway because they felt 'incomplete'.Perhaps I'm being too harsh on this book. This isn't like Kafka on the Shore - now if you like that book, I'm going to instantly develop a 5% aversion towards you and I know I'm being judgy. No, I can see why people like this book. I just do not like books that read more like movie/tv series scripts and this was certainly one of them."
1084,1.0,"What do you get when you mix predictability and dullness?The Midnight LibraryThis book really fucking sucked. Every single review I read loved this, even a close friend of mine recommended this to me, so imagine my surprise when my eyes were incapable of rolling back for the 74034 time due to the tedious plot. The main character was annoying (already forgot her name but don't care enough to look it up). From the first chapter you're able to figure out what she's going to do and how her story will end. The only reason I feel bad writing this review is because I don't want to bore you as much as this book bored me.

1087,3.0,"I'm uncertain as to what exactly I expected from this book, but certainly more than what I received in turn, given that it won the Goodreads Choice Award for Fiction in 2020. This is supposed to be a feel-so-good book, only that it didn't make me feel good. Not really. Of course, the story is based on a good premise, and I can understand why many readers found it inspirational. But it somehow didn't have the same magic on me.The story is simply about a woman (Nora Seed) who struggles with life and who is full of past regrets. She is tired of her fight to live and wishes to end it. But, she is offered a fantastic opportunity to live the lives she would have, had she made her life choices differently, through books in a midnight library. It is a pretty predictable story. We understand what the author is driving at; that is to say that the life you lead is the best possible life you can have and that it is the choices you make in life that define you and not your success. The premise is really good and it is the kind of book that I would have embraced. But for some queer reason, I couldn't fully connect with the story. It was sheer torture to get through some of the chapters. And I considered giving it up a few times. But overall, I'm glad that I persevered, for the author pulled some timely strings towards the end to steer the story on to a better and more enjoyable ground. The writing wasn't impressive. There were so many repetitive phrases that, at times, I could form what Nora is about to say before reading the written dialogue. I find that kind of writing quite tiresome. The author has thrown Thoreau's philosophical quotes lavishly to add weight, but, except for a desire to revisit Thoreau's Walden, most of them lost their contextual significance on me. All considered, it wasn't an easy reading journey for me. Although I ended up enjoying the final chapters, I struggled a lot in the middle. Rating the book wasn't easy either. I was greatly undecided till the very last chapter. However, for choosing a good and somewhat difficult premise and working a story on that, and trying his best to convey a timely and powerful message to the world when it is in dire need to hear it, I decided on a rounded three stars, keeping my personal perspectives at bay."
1088,5.0,"“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?” This is the premise of The Midnight Library, Matt Haig’s newest novel. I’ve never read anything by Haig before this book, but I can guarantee that this oversight will be addressed. Because The Midnight Library was wonderful. There’s incredible philosophical depth packed into relatively few pages. And for a book that begins with a suicide attempt, it ended up being surprisingly positive and uplifting. Not only is it a thoughtful novel, it inspired deep contemplation within the reader, but in a way that is comfortingly gentle for the times in which we’re living.“Fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut. Despair was when was the door closed and locked behind you.” Nora Seed doesn’t matter. Not to any single person on the face of the earth. At least, that’s what she thinks. When this belief leads her to the decision to end her own life, she finds herself caught between life and death in the Midnight Library. This library contains every single life she could have possibly led had she made even the slightest of different decisions. If she can find the perfect life among the stacks before midnight ends, she can keep it. But if she’s still undecided when the clock begins to tick once more, the Midnight Library will burn to ash, taking every perspective life, and Nora herself, along with it.“The thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory.”I loved accompanying Nora on each of her journeys. Not so much because they were adventures, though some of them were, but because I really enjoyed witnessing her growth. As she tackled her regrets, she slowly and sometimes painfully changed both her worldview and her opinion of herself and her worth. It was such an encouraging transformation, and reminded me more than a little of It’s a Wonderful Life. She's more important than she knows, and every decision she's ever made has rippled out to touch others. “And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. Of course, they come in different degrees and quantities. But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.” If given the same opportunity Nora has, would you try on different lives in hopes of finally finding one that fits? My knee-jerk response would be a unequivocal yes. But upon further reflection, I don’t think I would actually take that plunge. While I might not be the rock star or author or professor I dreamed of becoming as a child, those possibilities still live within me, and will until I draw my final breath. What I wouldn’t change for the world are the relationships I have. I’ve been blessed with an insanely fun marriage to my best friend, a tight-knit family, and some wonderful friendships. Any different path I might have taken could have radically altered any of those relationships. I honestly believe that it wouldn’t be worth the risk. Instead, I can take those relationships and the potential I know lives within me and make more of an effort to make one or more of my own dreams come true. The worst that could happen is that I fail and end up back where I started. What would I have lost? Absolutely nothing but the fear that kept me from trying in the first place, the loss of which would actually be worth failing in order to attain.“Sometimes just to say your own truth out loud is enough to find others like you.”Any work of fiction that can move its readers to reevaluate their own lives and try a little harder has accomplished something incredible. And if the book can do so in a way that is gentle and comforting instead of shaming in any way, that’s truly something special. Matt Haig gives us something that special with The Midnight Library. I can see this being a book I reread whenever life starts feeling like it isn’t worth the trouble. The Midnight Library is hope and potential and solace all packed into one slim book. Read it. Press it into the hands of anyone you know that might be struggling. Let it comfort and inspire you.You can find  this review and more at Novel Notions. "
1089,5.0,"After her attempted suicide, Nora Seed finds herself in a library where she just has to check out a book and fall into its pages to live the life she would have had if she had made a specific different choice earlier in life.It's an interesting concept and the author digs into the possibilities so well. This is one of those books that you just have to digest for a few days afterward, dreaming of the possibilities and implications. This one will stay with me for a long time to come. There are so many lessons here and they are not all spelled out. You need to ponder them for yourself. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it to everyone I know."

1093,4.0,"4 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️'Between life and death there is a library,' she said. 'And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have loved. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . .Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?'I think I should address this but The Midnight Library is not a book that is strictly focused on establishing a plot or indulges in fantasy as much as it is led by its narrative which revolves around what it means to live.That factor should not deter you from reading this book because I found it to be such an exhilarating experience.So, what is it about the Midnight Library that strikes it to be such a fascinating and impactful book? In many instances in our lives, the Infinite number of ""could have beens"" must've crossed our minds.You pick a choice among many, one out of millions of choices, yet the restlessness that gnaws at you pushes you to believe that there could have been a better choice that led to a better outcome.We always believe that the choices and decisions we make will always have better alternatives and it kills us because we are always haunted by it! In this story, we follow Nora Seed, a woman haunted by past mistakes and ridden with regrets. She believes that her life is destined to be miserable. Somehow, she holds on to the last thread connecting her to life but rather than find herself in oblivion, she is transported to a mysterious terrain with a building in the size of the church perched in the middle of it. Imagine if you found shelves full of books that tell the story of the lives you could have lived. The chance to experience each life you could've had; the one where you have picked what you thought was the better choice, or the one where you picked a different occupation, or the one you where you had become a happier person. That is the magic of the Midnight Library.Along with the heroine, we discover the vastness of life and its endless possibilities.It's a book that prompts us to reflect on our life and gives us a different lens to help us have a better look at the choices we make and how we view them.What is inevitable, you have no choice in changing it, and that is a difficult pill to swallow.You didn't have to enjoy every aspect of each life to keep having the option of experiencing them. You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed. Equally, enjoying a life didn't mean you stayed in that life. You only stayed in a life forever if you couldn't imagine a better one, and yet, paradoxically, the more lives you've tried the easier it became to think of something better, as the imagination broadened a bit more with every new life she sampled.It's a contemporary that coexists in a fantastical setting and it is tinted with a philosophical undertone that indirectly delivers the life lessons the author sought to gift the reader.Fortunately, the author managed to keep the story at good pacing with its poetic flow while smoothly weaving the important themes into the story without making the dialogue heavy nor dragging the progression of the story.It is a story that touched my sentiments because I've often been a person that drowned in my misery. This book felt like a soft breeze that gently caressed my soul.We only need to be one person.We only need to feel one existence.We don't have to do everything in order to be everything, because we are already infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility.Trigger Warning: mentions of suicide, death, depression and grief."

1095,3.0,"Nora has the chance to choose her life.. this is a sliding doors type of book. I don't like time travel or realism, so I'm afraid I chose poorly. I thought a real life friend recommended this to me, but I think I even got that part wrong!This was an extremely well written novel, the character of Nora (and those alternate versions) are executed with precision, each time we meet at her intersecting moments it's not hard to see what she is up to. The concept of the Midnight Library being the point where Nora is able to discuss life and philosophy and all her desires with her beloved school librarian is lovely too. There were so many good points to this story and as I said, it is very well written. I am glad I had a chance to read this author as I had not 'intersected' my reading timeline with his work. Most people will love this, library lovers, too. Just not my genre. Oh! I must not forget to mention Carey Mulligan as narrator - ten out of ten stars!Nora was an extremely likable character, and had so much good to offer, it was sad to see that she had any struggles at all.

1098,4.0,"Without a doubt, I really loved this story. The Midnight Library by Matt Haig drew a myriad of feelings from me like compassion, gratefulness, and a reflective soul searching as we travel into the depression-filled mind of a young girl. The following quote is a good plot summary. ‘Every book in here, every book in this entire library – except one – is a version of your life. This library is yours. It is here for you.’My understanding is that we move through alternate realities immediately after we die. There we encounter this library that contains a large number of your life stories that all changed based on the choices that we made in our lives. In particular, The Book of Regrets is a volume of our painful decisions and regrets. As someone who made multiple poor decisions and has experienced the feeling of regret because I should have done many things differently, this book resonated with me. In the end, we need to focus on how we can change tomorrow while letting go of yesterday. Superb book that I recommend. "

1101,5.0," 5 stars!   “The only way to learn is to live.”  Nora, a British woman suffering from depression, has a VERY bad day. And so, at the end of it, she decides to take her own life. Except instead, she ends up in the midnight library. A place where you can choose to live another life, one of the lives where you decided something differently. Nora gets the chance to see the different ways her life might have turned out and searches for the life that would be the perfect fit for her.  “A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.”  It’s funny, since the covid19 pandemic began, death has been on my mind a lot. I think and worry about it more lately than I ever did before. Reading this book was exactly what I needed right now. It was such a balm for the worry that’s been in the back of my mind this past year. I loved the concept of the midnight library and that we can see all the lives we could have lived based on any number of small or large decisions. This is one of the best “choose your own adventure” type fictions books I’ve ever read. I’ve always loved the parallel universe concept and this book completely nailed it.I listened to the audio version of this book on my commute and was so invested I would just sit in my car listening even after I reached my destination. I found myself getting all emotional while driving and had to pull myself together too. One of my favorite books of 2021, I know I will be thinking back on this book for a long time to come.  “Sometimes just to say your own truth out loud is enough to find others like you.”  "

1103,5.0,"This was the first adult novel I have read by Matt Haig, and I have to say: wow. Somehow he managed to bring both the pathos and depth of feeling of his memoir and the whimsy of his Christmas books together into a beautiful book about life, and death, and regret. "
1104,4.0,"I love the idea of a multiverse, of a “sliding doors” concept that lets us explore how different our lives would have been if we had made different choices. The thought of a library where you could read the book of an alternative life sounded intriguing and compelling. Wouldn’t that be fascinating? It’s a bit like googling and old boyfriend and feeling relieved (or not) that your 17-year-old self had the good sense to break up with him. Nora is in her thirties and feels bogged down with regrets. Her life is stale, she has no partner or children, her cat has just died and her brother is not answering her calls. So she decides to take her life. But instead of dying, she is magically transported into a magic library where she can explore all her regrets and see how her life would have been if she had been more courageous and made “better” decisions. As soon as she opens a different book of her own life, she is magically transported into her alternative life as it would be right now had she made a different decision in her past – to stick with her band, to study glaciology, to continue with her swimming career. The strange thing, I thought, was that Nora was dumped into these other lives without context or knowledge of her past in that particular life, or the people surrounding her. I found this extremely anxiety provoking! But I won’t give anything away here, because I don’t want to spoil your fun exploring this premise for yourself.I wanted to love this book as much as I liked its premise, but strangely didn’t find it as compelling as many other readers. Don’t get me wrong, it was an original and somewhat intriguing read, but didn’t grab me emotionally as much as I thought it would. I also found the ending predictable, though I hoped until the last page that the author would prove me wrong – he didn’t. Maybe my expectations were just too high. And because I can’t discuss the finer points without giving away spoilers I will just leave it at that. Thousands of readers have loved this thought-provoking and magical tale, so it’s best you go and judge for yourself. It certainly made me reflect on those crossroads in my life that may have led me into a totally different direction. An interesting read with some magical realism and food for thought that would make a great bookclub choice.3.5 stars *blog*  *facebook*  *instagram* "

""It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga.It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out.But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy.""
Life-affirming and beautiful, this book had me in tears from the first chapter. When Nora Seed enters the Midnight Library, she is able to pull books off the shelves and experience all the different lives that she could have lived if she’d made a few different choices. As someone who regularly questions every little thing that I do, this one really hit me hard.Whilst I did really enjoy this one and the writing style, it conveyed its (very important) message with all the subtlety of a hammer through a glass wall. But the message was lovely. So it’s kind of okay. "
1106,4.0,"Io adoro Matt Haig.I suoi libri arrivano quando meno te lo aspetti, arrivano sempre nel momento del bisogno e riescono, anche per pochi secondi, minuti o ore, a farti tirare un respiro di sollievo. La biblioteca di mezzanotte è un luogo a cui si arriva dopo il buio, e sopratutto dopo la luce.E’ un luogo pieno di libri, libri che raccontano delle storie, tutte diverse, di tante vite che avresti potuto vivere se avessi scelto di accettare quell’appuntamento, se avessi scelto di seguire la tua migliore amica in un altro paese o, ancora, se avessi scelto di intraprendere un corso di studi piuttosto che un altro.Ed è proprio in questa biblioteca che finisce la nostra Nora Seed, una ragazza che di scelte sbagliate e di rimpianti ne ha davvero tanti ma che ora ha la possibilità di sfogliare questi libri e immergersi in quella che sarebbe potuta essere la sua vita se avesse fatto scelte diverse.Matt Haig ci racconta una storia che tratta temi a lui cari e che abbiamo visto in tante altre sue opere: la depressione, l’ansia, il fallimento, l’amore e lo scorre del tempo che ti rincorre e ti mette i bastoni tra le ruote. E quando Haig racconta una storia mi sento capito, aiutato.“La biblioteca di mezzanotte” è un romanzo potente, pieno di simboli in cui è possibile rivedersi e nonostante non sia un romanzo perfetto ha la capacità di aiutare tutte quelle persone che almeno una volta nella vita si sono sentite come Nora.E’ vero, quella di Nora è una storia, è la sua storia, ma allo stesso tempo riesce ad essere anche la tua storia e quella di tante altre persone."

The way she accepted a glacier or a puffin or the breach of a whale.She imagined seeing herself as just another brilliant freak of nature.

'Between life and death there is a library,' she said."" And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices.... Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?'
After a very bad day where Nora Seed, suffering from depression and pretty much alone in the world, loses her job and her cat dies, she decides to end her life. Instead of dying immediately she found herself in the Midnight Library where she is given the chance to undo her regrets and see how her life could have been.The novel explores the idea that our lives have multiple branches where decisions affect the outcome not only for us but for those around us. Should we always make the safe decision, the one that pleases others or be adventurous and take the road less travelled? What is the perfect life - one where we have everything we could ever need, one where we make life better for others or one that is adventurous or glamorous? This was an interesting and fun, but not very deep, read as we follow Nora as she works through all her regrets with her favourite librarian, learning a lot about herself along the way."
1110,5.0,"The Midnight Libary exists within the gap between life and death that consists of shelves stacked with books of all the possible lives you could have lived.Just imagine being transported into a choose your own adventure...Just like the gameplay books that enjoyed as a kid, Haig's latest non fiction hit is made up of short chapters from the various paths that Nora could have led.Nora's disillusionment with her own life choices leds her to the decision to end it, that is where she finds herself being guided through the other possibilities by her old school librarian Mrs Elms.The themes of regrets and even the smallest choices shows the huge ramifications not only on our own lifes but also the people around us.I liked how in some instances Nora might have found the perfect job or lifestyle but the knock-on effect might mean that a family member is no longer around.The term life fright perfectly captures the whole novel.The notion that whilst not everything will be perfect there will always be regrets and inevitably how we learn to grow from them."
1111,2.0,"4.7/10I should have loved this book: it's a story that appears very close to my own. I know a fair bit about existential philosophy, but I also had my personal quarrel with death last November and thought (much like everyone around me) that I was about to kick it. However, once I completed this novel I was left bittersweet, and since all of this review relies on the end, the rest of this review will contain mild spoilers, although it's not a book based on mystery so is it even a spoiler? Your choice.A wise character who shall remain unnamed once said, 
'the hardest thing in this world is to live in it.'
 At first, it appears that our main character who committed suicide learnt that lesson once (spoiler alert) she makes the choice to to live again. However, once I sat down and truly reflected on this book, I realized one thing: Nora understands half of this sentence. She understands that life is a choice and one with heavy consequences, on par with existential belief. But she doesn't seem to understand that life is an everyday struggle, every day choice, as existential philosophers also believed in.I think this 'I'm going to live now, no more laziness, no more fear of failure, no more regrets' is very toxic. This fake productivity mentality influenced by a simplistic interpretation of existential philosophy is at the root of a lot of mental issues people face which is sold by capitalism in order to sell more fake-productivity shit we don't need or really want. And I'm quite disappointed that this book takes this fake-deep approach to existentialism, which can let a reader feel guilty for not immediately getting up and doing the dishes they didn't want to do earlier.Life is an everyday choice, precisely because it's hard. Choices wouldn't be choices if they were easy to make.This book didn't add that nuance to its interpretation of existentialism: because one can be authentic by making choices and owning up to the consequences that come with them. However, one can sometimes make the choice to sit still or make bad choices, and maybe to be your most authentic self, one needs to refuse to make choices (ironically it's a choice in itself, I know,) and accept the responsibility of the bad ones and hope for the best. Basically don't make people feel like sh*t for feeling like sh*t and staying in bed. The book seems so lost in trying to mimic existentialism that it forgot the nuance of the philosophy, the part that would actually be helpful to readers as it would show that Nora, even in the end, when she has chosen life, remains human and will still trip and fall once in a while. And sometimes in those trips and falls she'll make a bad choice once again and fighting for life will be difficult again, and that's reassuring.What's important about existentialism isn't making ""good"" choices, it's learning from your mistakes and never quitting the fight.Besides, there are no good or bad choices, there are only choices you make, those you don't, and their consequences.At its core, existentialism is about fighting, not about making ""good choices,"" and that's not what the end of the book reflects at all. It shows Nora, suddenly happy go lucky after her suicide attempt and excited to tackle life, and I wish we would have seen some of her trials and tribulations in the future, and saw how she learnt from her mistakes, and how she's willing to fight now.Now, that would have been a book that would make people feel better and reflect on their lives a bit.To conclude, I'm coming for Sartre's job. "
1112,5.0,"The Midnight Library is bestselling author Matt Haig’s latest novel and is an enchanting, beguiling and delightful story from the first page through to the last; there is an effortlessness about his prose that almost immediately sweeps you up and immerses you in the story. Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe, there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better? In The Midnight Library, thirty-four-year-old Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.This is a captivating, charming and moving read with the perfect combination of aspects to make this novel as special as it is: a taut and absorbing plot, a rollercoaster ride of emotional peaks and troughs, a superbly developed cast of characters, a relatable and very likeable protagonist in Nora, and beautiful writing. As with most Haig novels, it is thought-provoking, imaginative and has you ruminating about love and life, trials and tribulations, fear and hope. For a huge bookworm such as myself, books about books are an extra special treat when they are well written and I knew I could place my faith in Haig to pen another brilliantly absorbing tale. There are twists, turns and surprises aplenty as it progresses and not only is it humorous in places but it manages to be raw and empathetic towards the human condition too. The old adage ”the grass is always greener on the other side” fits this story perfectly where others' circumstances seem more desirable than one's own but in reality are often not. A perceptive, life-affirming and ultimately hopeful book I know I will remember for a long time to come. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Canongate for an ARC."
1113,5.0,I loved the adventures in this book. I enjoyed all the different stories (lives) the main character had to endure trying to figured out what she wanted out of her own life.
1114,5.0,"this book is absolutely incredible. it is about a woman named nora seed who attempts suicide after having an awful day where everything seemed to go wrong. she wakes up in a place called the midnight library that is full of an infinite amount of books that symbolize all of the lives she could have lived. she is given the opportunity to change some of her deepest regrets and see how her life would have been if she’d made different decisions. she is able to live out all of the “what if’s” she’d had before she tried to end her life. this book touches on a lot of deep topics, one of the main ones being, what is the key to true life fulfillment? it is a very thought-provoking book and it does a great job of blending fantasy and sci-fi while also making the story seem very grounded in reality. i definitely recommend this book!5/5 stars"
1115,3.0,"The book is majorly overhyped.I got caught in the midnight library hype, and was left disappointed.The book is good though. It asks a lot of important questions, discovers a lot of possible answers and eventually reaches the anticipated conclusion. Atleast I had already anticipated it.Nora Seed is dissatisfied with her life and decides to end it. After an overdose, she finds herself in the midnight library, between life and death. Over there she discovers what life would have been like if she'd made different decisions. She rediscovers her will to live. She lives hundreds of alternate lives, meets other people sliding between lives. But mostly she just discusses philosophy with everyone.You see I'm not a very philosophical person I have my times though when I start speaking about deep topics and then everyone just stares at me weird, as though I'm some alien. I also have a friend who we call jaadu because once she saw the sun and started looking at the sun and saying, ""Dhoop.""I feel that jaadu is very cute. I should probably watch Krrish again, it's been a long time.Coming back to the topic of Jaadu this book.I do feel philosophical at times. Just not while reading this book.One issue that I had was that it reaches the same conclusion that has already been grilled into our brains. It just takes the long path to do that, which would have been fine if not for the fact that it was not adventurous. It's ironic how Nora's adventuring new lives that fail to be adventurous.But guess what! Polar bears and pandas are my weaknesses and this book had them! So YAY to that!⭐⭐⭐⭐"
1116,5.0,"Auch wenn es mittlerweile einige kritische Stimmen gibt, konnte mich Matt Haig mit dieser Geschichte sehr begeistern. Ich konnte mich sehr gut in Nora einfühlen und ihren Kampf zum Leben nachvollziehen. Die Geschichte ist zwar vorhersehbar für mich gewesen aber dennoch so toll und sie hätte nicht anders verlaufen sollen,sonst hätte es für mich nicht funktioniert. Am Ende ist noch Platz für eigene Gedanken und Gefühle wie es wohl weiter geht und das finde ich richtig gut. Es gibt natürlich viele Weisheiten,die man schon kennt,aber sie mit Nora zu erleben und zu verinnerlichen hat mich sehr beeindruckt und wird mich so schnell nicht los lassen. ❤️"
1117,5.0,"I adored this book! While reading, I couldn’t help but think of my various childhood dreams and/or adult regrets, and wonder how different choices might have played out. I imagine this is true for anyone who reads the book. This book gives a lot of peace about things, no doubt. Reminiscent of one of my favorite movies, “It’s a Wonderful Life.” Five stars!"
1118,5.0,"What a trip down memory lane this has been for me – a book I was SURE that discoveries in Quantum would have brought about eventually! It was only a matter of time. I remember so plainly back in my University days how taken (possibly obsessed) I was by the workings of Quantum physics and by the whole new level of possibilities it opened up in terms of the concept of being and becoming within a literary framework – that has to do with characters, lives and people. I was also into Freud and his follower, Matte Blanco, who studied the former’s theories from a logico-mathematical, psychoanalytical standpoint and expanded on the concept of varying levels of emotions / thought processes as being at work simultaneously. My fascination had led to a vast number of sketches and plots for a novel that would assimilate the very concepts of quantum and multiplicity within a storyline that remains raw with emotion and feeling – shame I did not have the time to invest in the project, but you will certainly divine the sheer meaningfulness that such a novel as Midnight Library guaranteed for myself. And what a stroke of genius to counterbalance the almost insanely anti-human concept of multiverses to the intensely subjective context of a metaphysical platform that emanates from one’s own being in a personalised fashion: a Library scenario and the companionship / guidance associated with Mrs Elm (the Librarian), in Nora’s case. The lucid linearity of the narrative is impressive considering the absurd amount of lives Nora gets to have a go at within the suspended state between life and ‘desired’ death. The crux of the narrative is the interior journey Nora undergoes towards the realisation or rediscovery of her will to live, in line with the steady obliteration of her misconceptions about her root life, all archived in her Book of Regrets – it is as if the protagonist has to experience the reality of the various directions her own life could have taken and have a glance at their respective ramifications in order to reach the understanding that every life is a learning process and a life not created of one’s own accord will still imply a certain level of detachment from oneself, and therefore ‘disappointment’ or lack of sincere fulfillment, which is what sends her back to the Midnight Library every time. The wondrous climax is reached when Nora experiences a life she actually craves to stay in, with Ash and their daughter Molly, as well as her much aspired for career as a Philosophy teacher in Cambridge; yet it is within this very life that she senses from the beginning that lingering thought at the back of her mind that she will eventually have to return to the Midnight Library, and within this experience that she ends up seeking the real Mrs Elm at the Care Home – only to find out she had recently died – as a away of getting in contact with her root life. She also unexpectedly meets the little guy she had taught piano lessons to in order to help out his worried mum, and is appalled to find out that he had degenerated so much in a life without music as his therapy. This is her wake-up call, where the story comes full circle: she WANTED to return to that life, put all her effort in creating the life she somehow now knew she had it in her to create. The return of Time at this point in the narrative and the imagery of fire – the library burning to ashes – is almost cathartic, and conjures up the image of the phoenix, rising from the ashes. As Nora realises on her return, “the prison wasn’t the place, but the perspective”.If you are fascinated by the workings of Quantum theory, this will offer so much food for thought. The narrative is littered with references and reflections on the topic, as they apply to the storyline and enhance its meaning.For me personally, this is one to go on the re-read list! To all those yet-to-be first-time readers out there, my heartfelt recommendations of this literary feat: you definitely do not want to miss out on this one!"
1119,2.0,"Well, this book has a great premise and will appeal to a wide range of audience. Is there any human being who doesn't has any regrets or doesn't want to see how life would've turned out if he/she had made different choices ? The story is okay-ish and becomes a bit boring at places. The characterization was bland and shallow. I think this book is marketed as adult-fiction but the writing seems very YA; casual and simple (tastelessly simple, if you ask me). Probably appropriate for contemporary mainstream fiction but could've been better.Despite some philosophy, it lacks depth. Writing some quotable lines doesn't make a book deep. It felt like pinterest / tumblr type of inspirational quotes are thrown here and there in the story. The way author deals with depression, suicidal thoughts, regrets and despair is quite immature. I felt similar about Frederik Backman's Beartown as well - highly quotable book ; yet doesn't give feel 'mature enough' (though Beartown is a much better book). And, the way the philosophy is incorporated into the story feels a bit lame at a few places.For instance, see this conversation :Mrs Elm quickly rummaged for the paper tissue.... she brought it quickly to her face and sneezed into it.‘Bless you,’ said Nora, watching as the tissue disappeared from the librarian’s hands...‘Don’t worry. Tissues are like lives. There are always more.’ Mrs Elm returned to her train of thought. ‘Doing one thing differently is often the same as doing everything differently.'Now you have to philosophize sneezing into paper tissue as well! Really? Does is sound sensible?Lame.Anyway, I don't regret reading it. It's still good to see what works and what doesn't (for my own self, at least). "
1121,5.0,"Wow! Einfach nur wow! ❤️🙏🏻Dieses Buch war einfach unglaublich. Nora war als Protagonistin einfach nur menschlich. Matt Haig als Autor einfach nur genial.

1122,3.0,"I wanted to like this book but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype, i get the plotline & the character Nora she never gets friend requests on social media, she breaks up with her Fiancé Ben, then she counts the days till she wants to die, now doesn't that sound depressing... YES IT DOESI know where this is going but it lacked depth which put me right off I could not stand one more negative sentence, in these times of covid we need something positive to lift our spirits i know i am an outlier on this one but don't believe the hype."
1123,4.0,"4.25 starsThe Midnight Library is fast and easy to read, centering around the question - If you could choose between all possible versions of your life, which one would you choose? Definitely a unique concept and also dealing with more serious issues such as depression, this was nonetheless surprisingly easy and fast to get through, without actually losing its profundity. "
1124,3.0,"My book club’s pick for March, this was a sweet read—something between It’s a Wonderful Life, the time- and life-tripping TV series Quantum Leap, and a pop psychological New Age, quantum physics-infused self-help book. Through the story of a depressed Millennial woman named Nora, it is a dramatized self-inquiry exercise—assessing regrets, what personal success is, etc.—that may be particularly appreciated by a depressed, suicidal person or somebody who believes they would be happy “if only my life were different and I had XYZ.” I’m none of those things, but I enjoyed it, although I did get bored 60 percent through it—around the place where Nora, living a life as a famous rock star, talks about her famous song “Howl,” with apparently no awareness of the era-defining poem of the same name by Allen Ginsberg.*I don’t write sweet, but this book’s opening and premise were eerily familiar because I practically wrote it decades ago in a short piece before the moniker “flash fiction” existed.

.) For people who have read Haig’s book, I’m including it here so you can see the similarity but maybe laugh:Turning the PageWith a rattling gasp, she closed the book, arose from her dilapidated desk chair and glided soundlessly out of her cubicle, down the corridor, and through the heavy metal door. Funny, she thought. Usually it was locked, but it had given way with a touch. She'd never opened this door, let alone passed through its threshold. On the other side, she'd expected all manner of monsters: fire-breathing dragons, devils with red laser eyes, drunk writers with sour whiskey breath. There were no monsters. Nor was there a great white light where her rotten relatives—now dead and therefore enlightened—reached out to grasp her to their bosoms and chests, apologizing for all their corporeal sins against her and welcoming her to join them and also become good, sweet, and enlightened. Nor were there gates, pearly or otherwise—which made her smile, as she'd always known those were fairy stories and she'd never bought into them. Nor were there parallel universes where she could peek at her body doubles doing all the things she had thought about but failed to even attempt in her pathetic little life spent reading stacks and stacks of terrible slush-pile books as the only sixty-five-year-old editorial assistant in the history of book publishing.She'd always known she would die there. She'd known it was a matter of time until she read a book so horrendous that it killed her, and when she was finished, she would merely drop it on the floor, knowing that she had reached the end.""Hello!"" she called into the fog. ""I'm dead. Is anybody here?""In response, a new door materialized just in front of her and, as it creaked open, she was hit by a puff of familiar smell: books, new books that had become bestsellers after she'd rescued them from the slush pile, pushed them on her bosses, and been so annoying that they'd finally read them—only to take full credit for discovering them.""I'm very angry,"" she said to the smell. ""There is nobody here to greet me, and I'm so sick of books. Do you think you could take your smell somewhere else? No offense,"" she added because she'd always been a very polite editorial assistant, which is perhaps why she'd managed to hang on even through the Great Recession and blood bath of early 2009 when most of her department had been laid off, but old habits don't disappear just because you croak.In response, the smell turned left. She stepped through the new door and turned right, although there really was no such thing in this new world. For twelve hours she walked, although there really was no time and her cheap Timex (a gift from her boss) was frozen at the moment she'd closed the book.""Hello?"" she called, thinking she'd spied a figure through the murky fog. ""Hello, can you help me? I think I'm dead and I don't know what to do.""""Yes, you are. And you don't have to do anything,"" said a disembodied voice. ""You were very polite. You did a good job. But you might have explored a bit more—taken some chances—if you don't mind some feedback.""""Anything,"" she answered. ""I've always believed in revision. Please help me! I'm lost.""And with that, another door, exactly like the one she'd entered twelve hours ago, opened out of the murk. ""This way,"" said the voice. And she entered. It was a library of sorts. No people. Just millions and billions of unbound manuscripts.""Find a better story,"" said the voice, and with a hollow metal clang the door swung shut.©2005, 2020 Betsy Robinson, published in Girl Stories & Game Plays: An Anthology of Stories and Plays, 2nd ed._____________*More on Allen Ginsberg's poem ""Howl"" in this morning's (3/26/21) Book News by Ron Charles (some editor really should have told Matt Haig to find another title):A newly discovered original draft of “Howl,” by Allen GinsbergSixty-four years ago this week, customs officials seized 520 copies of an “obscene” poem published in England. Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl” couldn’t have asked for a better marketing campaign. With the help of the ACLU, Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti fought back. The rest is literary history. But that history and that poem have suddenly returned in a most unexpected way. Rare book dealer and Beats specialist Brian Cassidy has found a previously unknown original draft of “Howl.” This uncorrected carbon typescript is believed to be the very one Ginsberg used when he read the poem at Reed College in early 1956 — at least a year before “Howl” became the anthem of the counterculture revolution. Coincidentally, a long-lost recording of that Reed College reading — the earliest audio version of “Howl” — will be released next week (listen to a sample).Originally titled “Howl for Carl Solomon,” Ginsberg’s masterpiece went through considerable revision before it was published in 1956 by Ferlinghetti in “Howl and Other Poems” (story). That complex publishing history and the poem’s prominence make this 11-page unrevised version particularly valuable to scholars of 20th-century poetry. “To say that finding an original previously unknown draft of a major American work of literature is unusual is certainly an understatement,” Cassidy said in a statement. “And given that 'Howl' was famous pretty much from its inception, that an original typescript for it could have been unknown for this long . . . I was just blown away.""For anyone “burning their money in wastebaskets,” Cassidy is offering to sell this copy of “Howl” for $425,000 (add to cart)."
1125,4.0,"I loved the premise of this story. I loved the “Book of Regrets” and of possible other lives based on different choices, things about which I’ve contemplated a fair amount. I love this author and also enjoyed his book How to Stop Time (How to Stop Time)Highly imaginative and creative. Predictable but that wasn't a negative for me. I was left feeling melancholy more than uplifted though I know that was not the intent of the book/author. Great humor though it’s not exactly a humorous book, but much was amusing.It’s a highly quotable book. I love this author’s writing style and use of language in his writing/books.I simultaneously read a Kindle e-book and a Overdrive audiobook (both from the library) and I loved Carey Mulligan’s narration for the audiobook. For me her voice tone and inflections were perfection. She mispronounced some words though. At first I just thought it was English vs. American pronunciation but some words, including a place name of a place near me, were obviously being said incorrectly. I loved the parallel/multiple universes/alternative lives possibilities. Great fun!The power of love! The power of seeing the importance of minor choices! Being yourself!I guess the story is meant to be uplifting and inspirational, even to those feeling despair, but it will depend on readers and their perspectives how they will react to this book. No matter how it’s a great story with great characters. 4-1/2 starsI could have chosen even more quotes to “like” but here is a sampling of those I appreciated:“Never underestimate the big importance of small things.” “Well, that you can choose choices but not outcomes.”“Doing one thing differently is often the same as doing everything differently. Actions can’t be reversed within a lifetime, however much we try”“The only way to learn is to live” “Regrets don’t leave. They weren’t mosquito bites. They itch forever.”“Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small. But every time one decision is taken over another, the outcomes differ. An irreversible variation occurs, which in turn leads to further variations.”““Equidistant. Such a neutral, mathematical kind of word, and one that became a stuck thought, repeating itself like a manic meditation as she used the last of her strength to stay almost exactly where she was. Equidistant. Equidistant. Equidistant. Not aligned to one bank or the other. That was how she had felt most of her life. Caught in the middle. Struggling, flailing, just trying to survive while not knowing which way to go. Which path to commit to without regret.”“Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?” “A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.”“Maybe that’s what all lives were, though. Maybe even the most seemingly perfectly intense or worthwhile lives ultimately felt the same. Acres of disappointment and monotony and hurts and rivalries but with flashes of wonder and beauty. Maybe that was the only meaning that mattered.”“Maybe even suicide would have been too active. Maybe in some lives you just float around and expect nothing else and don’t even try to change. Maybe that was most lives. ‘Yes,’ said Nora, aloud now. ‘Maybe I got stuck. Maybe in every life I am stuck. I mean, maybe that’s just who I am. A starfish in every life is still a starfish. There isn’t a life where a starfish is a professor of aerospace engineering. And maybe there isn’t a life where I’m not stuck.”“The life of a human, according to the Scottish philosopher David Hume, was of no greater importance to the universe than that of an oyster. But if it was important enough for David Hume to write that thought down, then maybe it was important enough to aim to do something good. To help preserve life, in all its forms.”“Every second of every day we are entering a new universe. And we spend so much time wishing our lives were different, comparing ourselves to other people and to other versions of ourselves, when really most lives contain degrees of good and degrees of bad.”“it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunize you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other. Of course, they come in different degrees and quantities. But there is no life where you can be in a state of sheer happiness for ever. And imagining there is just breeds more unhappiness in the life you’re in.’”““Nora wanted to live in a world where no cruelty existed, but the only worlds she had available to her were worlds with humans in them.”“We only know what we perceive. Everything we experience is ultimately just our perception of it. “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”“She realized that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality. As Thoreau wrote, ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”“It was as though she had reached some state of acceptance about life–that if there was a bad experience, there wouldn’t only be bad experiences. She realized that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery. That, she supposed, was the basis of depression as well as the difference between fear and despair. Fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut. Despair was when the door closed and locked behind you.”"

So come November 1st I absolutely was digging through the dungeon belting this song out . . . . Haul out the hollyPut up the tree before my spirit falls againFill up the stockingI may be rushing things, but deck the halls again nowFor we need a little ChristmasRight this very minuteCandles in the windowCarols at the spinetYes, we need a little ChristmasRight this very minuteIt hasn't snowed a single flurryBut Santa, dear, we're in a hurryAnd willing to get the black lunge from flocking flying off the artificial tree forest down there. I had no clue what this book was about before putting my name on the library waiting list. I simply knew I really enjoyed The Radleys so I’m more than happy to continue reading Matt Haig’s stuff. The story here is about Nora, a 35 year old woman who has decided to end her life. (Obviously – trigger warning.) She then finds herself in the “Midnight Library” – a limbo of sorts where every potential life you could have lived depending on the choices you made is available on the shelves. You simply have to choose the volume you would like to read. Find one you like? You can remain there forever. Determine that you were correct and life is truly hopeless for you, the library will crumble out of existence. To me this was a modernization of one of my favorites . . . . 

I loved it."
1127,1.0,"The premise sounded really interesting and our small family group decided to listen together as we worked a jigsaw puzzle. We started the audiobook and began to listen. Before long, it was truly noticeable to me how everyone's mood lowered as we listened. We kept hoping that it would pick up. However, we found the main character unlikeable and completely lacking in self awareness, and the Librarian smug and self-satisfied. The repetitiveness and lack of finesse of the writing seemed to drag it down further. We reached the two hours mark or 23% according to Overdrive and couldn't listen any further."

1130,3.0,"3+ starsMy reaction to this book was an enigma to me. It had many flaws that would normally cause me to dislike a book. It sometimes felt like a book for children or a fairy tale. At other times it seemed like a manual for the depressed. The 'make lemonade out of lemons' theme was spelled out too many times. Nora Seed, about to blossom with sunshine, Mrs. Elm, the woman like the tree, full of strength and endurance - very corny. Did I think the new Nora was on a manic high and would spiral down into depression again? Yes, yet...I liked this book.I have always liked the idea of alternate lives. What if I had moved there? Married him? Chosen that profession? I loved Kate Atkinson's Life After Life. The concept of books in a midnight library was awkward but fascinating. It was a dream, and dreams often don't make sense. This was the first book I have read by Matt Haig, and I really liked his writing. ""A person was like a city, you couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile."" I also enjoyed the excerpts from Thoreau's Walden.For me, this was a worthwhile read and one that shouldn't be overanalyzed, just enjoyed as an endorsement of life, even with its disappointments and sorrows. Maybe this reminder came just when I needed it.""If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours."" Henry David Thoreau as quoted  in The Midnight Library"

1132,4.0,"Confession: it took me a while to warm to this popular novel, which initially seemed a tad schematic, manipulative and sentimental – a cross between It’s A Wonderful Life and The Bell Jar. But gradually I got caught up in its many worlds. By the end, I was very moved and inspired.Nora Seed, a 35-year-old once-promising swimmer, musician, and philosophy student, decides she wants to die. On the night she attempts suicide, she enters the titular Midnight Library, a place between life and death where she can try out different lives, Frostian roads she never took but now can. The result is imaginative, often funny, and full of shrewd observations about life, love and how the grass always looks greener on the other side. Author Matt Haig has been open about his own struggles with mental illness, and that’s one of the strongest themes in the book.While some bits of dialogue occasionally feel contrived – occasionally I thought, “People don’t talk like that” – it didn’t bother me. I understood what Haig was doing to fill in plot points. Other parts were very subtle; I admired the care he took with the details of Nora’s life.The novel also made me think about things I like and dislike about my own life and wonder about paths I never followed – but still might. When a book speaks to you like that, you know there’s something special – even a bit of magic – about it."
1133,4.0,"My second book by this author. Definitely better than the first one I read and with a very important message.
Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices... Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?
Nora is tired of life. Her cat just died, she's alone, her brother isn't speaking to her and she was fired as well. And this after a pretty shitty childhood and constant struggles with mental health problems. So she decides to kill herself. But then she ends up in the Midnight Library where she gets to read from The Book of Regrets that lets her experience alternate lives. Will she choose life in the end? Will the library let her choose or what is the lesson here?A very interesting though not groundbreaking examination of the nature of regret and sorrow and trying to climb out of that dark hole before it's too late.I guess I loved the image and idea of the library / the librarian most of all. However, I also enjoyed accompanying Nora while she was experiencing all those different versions of her life and how (view spoiler)[she was shown that Volts wouldn't have survived and that there was good reason for her no longer being with Dan (hide spoiler)] because the grass isn't always greener on the other side.There was a personal message for me in here. No, I'm not suicidal, but I think every person - one way or another - has at least one thing that they regret and that eats away at them. Having to face that fact and accept that you can't turn back time, might bring you peace but it's also hard. So in a way, this book had a soothing moment for me.Nevertheless, the ending was obvious from the start - I had actually expected the author to pull a twist of some kind so I was surprised when that never came. *lol*The writing style was also very nice with short-ish chapters that made even the darkest themes more bearable (important due to the subject matter). Nothing groundbreaking but definitely very important and enjoyable."
1134,2.0,"You might be asking yourself: what's this misanthrope got against (at the time of writing) the MOST READ BOOK OF 2021 ON GOODREADS? Well folks, I had every reason to love this book. I'm a fairly big fan of multiverse stories and I enjoy a tale in which a character comes to some personal revelation through fantastical means. What's more, my wife picked it up for my birthday and she tends to hit the target almost infallibly. Even though the writing is snappy, readable, and moves rather quickly, I just couldn't get down with the obvious aims of the story. In the book's opening pages our lead, Nora Seed, decides to take her own life and finds herself in a library that houses every possible variation of her life. From there we get bits and bobs of philosophy, quantum physics, and cognitive behavioural therapy as plot. Herein lies the rub: the book felt more like self-help than adventurous or revelatory. The plot-as-therapy beats came off a bit too heavy-handed and I found I could see the ending a mile away. I'm sure for a lot of people in 2021 this book lands at a resonant moment. Lots of people are in a tough space, mentally, and Nora's misanthropic zipping through the multiverse is relatable, but the lessons she learns are also applicable to everyday life. I don't begrudge this experience of the novel, I just found it personally grating. There are some good passages in here and one of the last lives Nora lives in the novel hits an emotional peak that failed to land with the other quantum forays. It's not that this is a terrible work, it's just one that didn't work for me. It's a shame I didn't enjoy this more, but providing Haig's other work is less narrative CBT manual, I think I'd be into it. Ah well!"
1135,5.0,"Somebody told me, ""Don't waste your time on this. It's not as good as it could have been."" Guess what? I didn't listen!! I picked this one up the other day, and it was so hard to put down.What if you said yes instead of no? What if you turned left instead of right? There are so many different ways to go in life, an infinite number of possibilities, and anything could happen. We have no way of knowing! I have teetered on the edge of wanting to live and wanting to die. That is probably the ultimate decision a person could make - to keep going, or to end it all. And what happens when someone dies? What becomes of that person. Someone who doesn't think they matter to anyone else in the world could actually mean the world to someone else. It does sound cliche to put it that way, but it's true. Your life has a ripple effect, even if you don't think so. Your choices don't have the potential to affect just you but it could affect those in your life, even if they aren't ones you keep in touch with day in and day out.This book really made me think about how my choices impacted my life and how they have impacted others close to me. I matter.... And so do you!! So: Don't. Ever. Give. Up."

1138,4.0,"4.25 stars!! This book is so, so good. So magical. And I really enjoyed the concept of there being a library between life and death that contains all these different lives that you could have lived if different decisions were made and actually did the things you later on regret. It's so intriguing because I 100% wish I could go back and change some things from my past even though that's absolutely impossible, I'm glad this book exists to teach us and explore that concept in a fantastical sense. I really enjoyed Nora Seed as the main character; she was real and honest with herself in the end yet my heart broke for her in the beginning, when she thought that her life was not worth living for anymore. It was so fun and interesting reading about all the potential lives that Nora experienced in the library. The fact that this book had some fantasy aspects in it, (when usually fantasy books, no matter how big or small the fantasy element is, are not my thing) but this one had just the right amount of magic as well as real life. I love Matt Haig's writing. I was really drawn to his words when I first read 'Notes on a Nervous Planet' which was a book that really helped me when I was in a really hard place mentally. 'The Midnight Library' was so real about mental health, but Matt Haig also speaks to positively and it's almost like he wrote the book just for you, to help you, and to show you that everything will be okay."
1139,1.0,"I so badly wanted to love this novel, and I would have settled for liking it... alas, I did neither. Everything was wrong with this book. The characters were shallow and under developed, their motives were barely explored, the prose was trying very hard (and failing) to be profound, instead just sounding cringey, and the way the characters spoke, it was like Matt had never heard humans have a conversation before. The plot itself was mildly interesting, albeit not new or unique, but it was so poorly executed that I could not wait until it ended. I stuck it out to the end, just so I could say I gave it a proper go, and I really tried throughout to like it, but I simply didn't. I understand why he is no.1 in The Times Bestsellers list, especially right now, I feel like it could help a certain type of person. But for me, it was just one long and ludicrous cliche, with as many modern terms squished in as possible. If you are a certain type of book snob, like myself, who enjoy genuinely profound and thought provoking novels, save your time and money and give this one a miss. "
1140,4.0,"I feel like this book is one that’s going to stay with me for a long while! Although this didn’t have as much action as I thought it would, I really did appreciate the life lessons in here, and the slow and steady pace of it all. I think for anyone wanting to read something a little different in-between your usual genres, this book is perfect. This will definitely leave you contemplating your own life choices, and I could only imagine how much more profound it will be in a few years time, when I reread it."

1145,4.0,"| |  blog |  tumblr | ko-fi | |3 ½ stars (rounded up because Carey Mulligan was a brilliant narrator)  “You have as many lives as you have possibilities. There are lives where you make different choices. And those choices lead to different outcomes. If you had done just one thing differently, you would have a different life story. And they all exist in the Midnight Library. They are all as real as this life.”Matt Haig presents his readers with a touching and ultimately life-affirming tale of second chances. The Midnight Library follows Nora, a lonely thirty-five-year-old woman from Bedford, who has just hit rock bottom. She's single, her only maybe-friend lives in Australia, her brother seems to hate her or at least he makes a point of avoiding her, and she has just been fired from String Theory, the music shop she worked for the past twelve years. Nora is tired of being sad and miserable, of being eaten up regrets. She's exhausted of living. What awaits Nora is the Midnight Library, a place that sits “between life and death” and where “the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices”. Each book presents Nora with another version of her life. What if she had kept training as a swimmer? What if she had married her ex? What if she'd stayed in her brother's band? What if she'd kept on studying?The possibilities are infinite and Nora finds herself wanting to experiences them all. As she jumps from book to book Nora soon realises that there isn't such a thing as the perfect life. Even in the life in which she has pursued swimming her relationship with her father isn't great. By living all these different lives, Nora's no longer feels guilty for not doing what others expected or pressured her to do. Happiness is a tricky thing, and it cannot be achieved by simply acquiescing to others desires.Haig's imbues Nora's story with plenty of humour. Although the story touches on mental health (depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, panic attacks, addiction) the narrative maintains an underlining note of hope. Haig showcases great empathy, never condemning anyone as being responsible for another person's unhappiness.Although the novel isn't too sentimental it did feel a bit too uplifting (I know, I am a grinch). Perhaps I wanted to story to delve in darker territories but Nora's story is rather innocuous. Still, this was a heart-warming book, and the 'what if' scenarios could be very entertaining as I was never bored. Haig as a penchant for dialogues and discussing mental health related issues with both clarity and sensitivity. I listened to the audiobook which was narrated by Carey Mulligan, who does an exceptional job (I just really loved her narration).Read more reviews on my blog / / / View all my reviews on Goodreads"
1146,3.0,"As a person and as an author I admire Matt Haig so much, I’m already a major fan and love the work he does at promoting mental health awareness and discussing his own personal experiences with depression so to say I was extremely excited to read this and seeing all the accolades this book has received was an understatement. So it pains me that my rating was only 3 stars, not that I didn’t enjoy the story, I liked it and kept finding myself wanting to pick it up so I’m struggling to understand what the missing ingredient was for me, maybe I have difficulty with this particular genre, I found the book a little predictable, I could clearly see the author trying to find depth in Nora’s predicament, the lost soul looking for a reason to live. I feel like it was full of potential but it fell abit short in wowing me, I was too caught up in the mechanics of the whole parallel universe scenario. Maybe I just lack imagination. I guess that’s on me."
1147,4.0,"Wow. I needed this right now. As someone who struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts, this book really hit home. When I was younger, I attempted suicide several times, so I could relate 100% with the main character.So much of my life has been spent regretting my decisions and wondering about all the lives I could have lived had I made better ones. I often feel incredibly lonely and angry with myself for not being where I should be. I’ve wasted so much time and ruined so many good things.But this book reminded me that as long as we’re alive, we are filled with potential. That each moment contains infinite possibilities and even the smallest things we do, can have a huge impact on the world around us. It’s so hard to see that with our limited perspective. A simple little story, a bit predictable, but so powerful. It reminded me a bit of It’s a Wonderful Life. I recommend it if you’re feeling low."
1148,1.0,"DNF @ 70%Please don't hate me for this. Although I found it plot interesting at first, I was really looking forward to it, but then I kind of disappointed by how the story turned out.Nora had tried a ton of life she could have lived provided by Midnight Library, but there wasn't much depth detail in any stories and characters from each of her life. She jumped in, talked to people for a bit, and then jumped out. She genuinely hadn't really lived in those lives (you know what I mean?). I felt that the characters in this book were so flat. They just existed to talk about philosophy and then gave us some good quotes. No plot. That's it. I couldn't connect well with the story whatsoever.P.S. If the rest of the book I hadn't read is getting better/ something I shouldn't miss will happen, just let me know so I may continue reading it."

I never wanted this to end. The messages this book gives you about life and perspective feels more like a self-help book, but it is told in a dazzling sci-fi.“Every life contains many millions of decisions. Some big, some small. But every time one decision is taken over another, the outcomes differ. An irreversible variation occurs, which in turn leads to further variations…”Nora is 35 years old. After being sacked from her job, her cat dying, the elderly next-door neighbour not requiring her assistance and a teenage boy no longer requiring piano lessons her despair and depression leads her to be full of life regrets. Which leads her to the decision to end her life. Upon ending her life, she finds herself in an existence between life and death. A library full of books, the lives she could have lived had she made different choices. With the assistance of the librarian Nora goes on to live and experience some of the lives she could have lived.“The only way to learn is to live.”In her root life Nora studied philosophy at university and I loved that there were many mentions and quotes from famous philosophers. It strengthened the story and added to its genius. The ending of the book is beautiful and the message special. This is my first Matt Haig book and love does not quite cover it. "

Nora es un personaje entrañable, aunque a veces sea testaruda y súper negada. Esta novela empieza muy arriba, y llegando a la mitad del libro puede sentirse algo repetitiva, con una idea monótona. El final tiene todo el dejo de autoayuda, cosa que no me fascinó, pero tampoco lo odié. En resumidas cuentas: un buen libro, nada sobresaliente ni deslumbrante, pero que me acompañó en algunas situaciones difíciles que viví recientemente, y honestamente me sentí en mi propia Biblioteca de la Medianoche."
1155,1.0,"The only reason that I read this was because it was chosen the winner of the Goodreads Choice Awards in the fiction category. The synopsis sounded stupid to me. Boy, talk about calling it earlyPuerile doggerel that’s part huckster get-rich-quick bullshit, and part TV evangelist. This is just like those moronic homilies in which people say stuff like “coulda, woulda, shoulda” without being ironic. One of my favorite novels is Memoirs of an Invisible Man by H.F Saint, which means that I don’t have a problem with suspending belief, but this doesn’t even make any sense. The top review of this book has over 1,000 LIKES* and is four sentences of stock praise with nothing approaching insights or critiques; there is nothing about the book. A review, by definition, is supposed to be a critical examination, not just gushing over how much you loved it. The antonym of this review would be the following: it sucked. I would never just write “It sucked” because I would outline specifically why I thought it sucked, which I will do here concerning Goodreads Fiction of the Year readers’ choice.This novel is the moral equivalent of listening to a baby cry for several hours, or however long you read this before throwing in the towel. Except babies often have a reason for crying and don’t do it purposefully simply to annoy us. Waaaa! My life isn’t perfect, I’m not happy. Fucking grow up! Her choices in life are Olympic swimmer or packed-arena rock star? Just stupid.It annoyed the hell out of me that she didn’t know anything about the life she was entering and had to ask stupid questions, like some oaf who enters a movie theater after it’s started and asks a stranger next to her to bring her up to speed. Way too much of the book is in this irritating vein. I’ve noticed some British writers use the words “at all” (pronounced “eh toll”) too much. Don’t “It was nothing” and “It was nothing at all” mean exactly the same goddamn thing? Once you notice this, it becomes like trying to ignore a Tourette’s Syndrome verbal tick. She wondered for a moment if she shouldn’t get the door at allgone in wonderful directions, but now went nowhere at allshe could no longer see the walls at allIt was possible that the shelves weren’t moving at allit will hardly be there at all.they couldn’t really be seen as individual books at all.she was no longer a person reading it, and a consequent moment where there was no book – or library – at all.Sometimes regrets aren’t based on fact at all.The house key had no information on it at all,floating in a tank that resembles nothing at all.And this time she was aware of feeling absolutely nothing at all.No problem at allShe said it casually, almost as if it was nothing at all.And then decided he didn’t want to go to uni at all.And the moment she had said it was nice to be there, was also the moment she wasn’t there at allAre there any other lives at all or is it just the furnishings that change?Hardly a laugh at all.Nothing.

So yeah, anyone care to explain this to me? Take out “at all” from any of these phrases and the meaning is exactly the same, if anything, this verbal tick, this redundancy, dilutes the negative.Sorry, but Groundhog Day tells a story ten times more interesting than anything you will find between the covers of this young adult novel. The philosophy in this was childish, like the author had just read a Wikipedia article on the subject before stuffing it into this book. I would never consider Henry David Thoreau to be a philosopher.I read How to Stop Time by this writer. I thought the premise was amazing, but the execution was absolutely dreadful and annoying. I didn’t really care for the premise of this book. I don’t think people look back and put blame on the regrets of their life. He just doesn’t tell any good stories. Nothing happens in this that I care to remember a day later."

I know Matt Haig has written a memoir Reasons to Stay Alive in which he documents his struggles with depression and his search for meaning and I’m guessing his personal experiences have helped shape the themes and narrative of this book.Nora Seed, our main character, is in her mid-30s, has just lost her job and her cat and is feeling pretty down and has plenty of regrets. I won’t put in a spoiler explaining why, but Nora finds herself in the Midnight Library where she comes across the Book of Regrets of her life in which every regret she has had ever had since the day she was born is recorded. Nora realises quickly that they range from the minor “I regret not doing any exercise today” to the substantial “I regret not telling my father I loved him before he died”. In the Midnight Library, with the assistance of her favourite school librarian Mrs Elm, she has access to parallel universes and can immerse herself and actually live in a particular life and see if she likes it or not. She finds herself in a life where, rather than quit swimming at 14, she does continue with it and was good enough to get to the Olympics; she transfers to another life where, rather than call off her wedding at the last moment, she does marry Dan and they are running a country pub as was previously discussed and planned; in another experience, rather than use commitments as an excuse to stay home, she does go to Australia with her friend Lizzy. As well as all of these lives related to her ‘root life’, she gets to taste a wild array of other lives at her whim and fancy.I think this book is a lot of fun. I can understand how some readers may feel it treats the serious subject matter in an overly light-hearted way but it worked for me and I am adding it to my 2020 favourites.Nora really is in a state of despair, she has always struggled to accept herself and she can’t find any reason to keep living - but I didn’t at any stage feel weighed down by Nora’s state of mind and her feeling of helplessness. Instead I found it uplifting and inspiring. For that reason alone I have to give it 5 stars. Matt Haig has done a great job of weaving in a healthy dose of philosophy (e.g. Thoreau’s “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see”), along with servings of humour, time travel, quantum physics and parallel universes to look at what it is to be human and to find meaning in your life.……....It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not the lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It’s the regret that makes us shrivel and whither and feel like our own and other people’s worst enemy……We just have to close our eyes and savour the taste of the drink in front of us and listen to the song as it plays. We are completely and utterly alive as we are in any other life and have access to the same emotional spectrum.... Yesterday it was impossible for me to accept my life as it is now. And yet today that same messy life seems full of hope. Potential."
1157,5.0,"Nora Seed has hit an all-time low. After losing her cat, her job, and is full of regret, she takes her own life. However, she suddenly finds herself in the Midnight Library – a point between life and death – and learns that she has an opportunity to live as if she had done things differently. She had felt like she had let everyone down, including herself. But things are about to change.“Because, Nora, sometimes the only way to learn is to live.”The concept of ‘The Midnight Library’ is wonderful, and Haig executes it brilliantly. How different could life be if we made another choice? How could one decision change the lives of the people around us? And, is there any such thing as a perfect life? In one life Nora is an internationally famous rock star. In another, she works as a scientist in sub-zero temperatures in the Norwegian archipelago. She is an Olympic athlete, a vegan powerlifter, rich, poor: the possibilities are infinite. Throughout it all, Haig seamlessly interjects magic into the most prosaic of details. Furthermore, in his bestselling memoir ‘Reasons to Stay Alive‘, Haig chronicled the personal anxiety and depression he experienced which lead him to consider taking his own life. In ‘The Midnight Library’, he is just as unflinching in his depiction of depression. He seamlessly articulates how debilitating it can be, how it can feel like you’re stuck in a black hole. And yet, his writing never feels dismal. Rather, he counterbalances sombre moments with a hopeful tone and a touch of humour. While sometimes Nora’s monologues were repetitive, the meaning was clear: even when you feel like you’re trapped, there is always a way out of the darkness.There’s so much more to unpack in this book. From ideas around climate change and the connection between ourselves and the world to familial relationships, fame, and the nature of happiness. Matt Haig tackles so many themes with such grace: a reminder to live life to the fullest and appreciate every moment, even the hard ones. As Nora tries on the many shoes of her infinite lives, we see how making space for regrets is one step towards softening their hold over us. We can have regrets without being their prisoner.Overall, ‘The Midnight Library’ is a truly inspiring story that, yes, is full of hurt and despair, but also love and transformation. Haig eloquently articulates the consuming nature of depression for those who find that words escape them. As with ‘Reasons to Stay Alive’, I’m so grateful for this book and vouch that everyone should read it. The only way to learn is to live.Thank you Matt Haig, Canongate Books, and NetGalley for my eARC in exchange for an honest review!4.5/5 stars rounded up to 5"
1158,5.0,"This book talks about so many different topics, but most of it all it is about regret and the paths we take in life. Matt Haig’s writing is raw and beautiful, whilst also conveying so many important messages in a brilliantly told story. Haig uses Nora to tell his story, Nora is dreadfully unhappy and suffering from depression, but from this darkness, Nora is given a choice. She is given the chance to look at all the paths she could have taken in life and see if she wants to settle in one of them. She can look at her very own book of regrets and can explore each avenue to see what would have happened if she’d have explored different angles in her life.I doubt there is a person alive that lives with zero regrets, and if there is, I take my hat off to them. But the sheer relatability of this book means I think I’d recommend it to near enough anyone. Nora sees so many different lives she could have had, she is rich, poor, alone, married, has a child, has a cat, is famous, is working her dream job. This book lets the reader live out their own dreams through Nora and I love that about it. Nora is so real and just… well… human. She could be you or your friend or your neighbour. Haig has done a truly fantastic job at bringing his readers to life in the pages of these books, which makes this book read as something very special indeed.Aside from the leading concept of this book, it also looks at our relationships with others, how we treat those we love, how we treat ourselves, our planet. At one point Nora works in climate change and we get an insight into the failings we as humans are offering to our planet. Matt Haig honestly does try to put a lot of issues into this book of humanity and he succeeds. This book is almost an anthem of literature for change, regret and living our lives how we want to live them. I really liked that this book certainly leaves you wanting to live your life to the full, but also that doesn’t have to be scuba diving and cliff diving, it can be enjoying the things you love and finding joy in them.This book was such a simple concept that just dug so deep into its themes. I always think Matt Haig does a brilliant job of normalising talking about mental health and this book is no exception. He clearly writes from experience and with care. Reading this book may make you feel a little less alone, I would highly advise it."
1159,5.0,"“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?” Nora Seed is having a tough time. She has been fired from her job, her cat died and her relationships with other people are unstable. Nothing appears to be going well so Nora decides to end it. Except that she winds up in the Midnight Library instead. In it, there are thousands of books with the thousands of possible lives Nora could have lived if she had made different choices. Nora is told that she can choose one book at a time to live in. If she finds a life she likes better, she can stay there permanently. So as Nora starts exploring all the 'what-ifs', she begins to appreciate life anew.""The only way to learn is to live.""This is a book I had my eye for a while so when I saw it on the list for best fiction, I decided to not wait any longer to read it. For a relatively short book, it packs a punch. Nora Seed is not okay. She has been fired, her cat died and none of the relationships in her life are working out. She decides to stop trying. But then something unusual happens. She winds up in the Midnight Library. Suddenly, all the lives she could have had are laid before her. All she has to do is pick a book, enter a different life and see if its better than her current one. As she goes through her regrets and undoes some of her past decisions, it becomes clearer that maybe there is no such thing as a perfect life. The short chapters made this narrative flow quite nicely. The prose is simple but powerful. The concept is impactful. Who has not wished for a different outcome in life at some point? There is a mention of quantum physics in the story but it is not overwhelming and is simply explained. Above all, this book is thoughful and well rendered. The tone is solemn. Its not a book that can be called fun or entertaining but its certainly memorable. This is the first time I read a book by Matt Haig and I have just learned that he deals with mental health issues. His observations and thoughts do reflect that, they are honest and hopeful. I am glad to hae read this book and will look into more books by Haig in the future."
1160,5.0,"I'm not going to recap this book, it's been done enough in other reviews but it's a wonderful read. A book that made me sit back and think about all the regrets in my own life (and there have been a LOT) and how really life hasn't been that bad after all. A book that makes you think about your own life in this way definitely deserves five stars. It will stay with me a long time.I had only read one Matt Haig book before this How to Stop Time and loved it. I will be checking out his other ones ASAP. "
1161,4.0,"Is it sci-fi? Is it fantasy? Whatever it is, it was a magical read. Loved the way Matt Haig managed to put into words the question we all (especially us indecisive people) ask ourselves way too often: What if I had made different choices? Where would I be or could I be? Proving that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. There's physics, there's philosophy, depression, regret, travel.It's great. Go read it!"
1162,4.0,"Short and sweet, I finished this in a days' reading. I've read several stories that explore the ""what could have been"" scenario, and while this was among the more simple and straightforward, I enjoyed it very much. I think reading it on New Year's Day was perfect, especially after the dumpster fire that was 2020."
1163,5.0,What a magical story! I have never read anything like it!
1164,5.0,"Antidepressants? Therapists? Yoga? Nah. I'll have this book instead!🗣There are no spoilers in this review BUT I was just so fascinated by this book I had to put here at least a couple of quotes🗣 Who wouldn't love to live, just for a little while, each one of the infinite variations of the life he could have possibly had, if he had done something, even the most trivial thing, differently? ""Maybe there was no perfect life for her, but somewhere, surely, there was a life worth living.""Thank you for letting me into that magical place, between life and death, where nothing is impossible and everything is possible.As a person who has been struggling with depression ever since I can remember myself, this masterpiece allowed me a temporary refuge in the form of Nora. I felt understood. I felt like I was not alone. I felt like everything could and would be okay, because you are more than the sum of your depressive episodes. You are an amazing human being with an infinite number of possibilities.Like Nora, I felt underfulfilled most of my life and destined to live a bland, boring, and ordinary life. Why should I even aspire for more and to become more? That's life. Life sucks. What can you do about it? You can work hard and achieve a lot of things, but at the end of the day your life expectancy would still be around 70-80 years at best. I always felt like I could hope for more, and that is all that was. Hope. But then when my life was accidentally on the line, the most primitive instict kicked it. To live. So should one listen to the primitive part of the brain, telling him/her/them to stay alive? Or better listen to that more evolutionarily developed portion of his/her/their brain, the neocortex, forming the conscious mind and giving the possibility to form coherent train of thoughts, forcing you to analyze every tiny bit of your life and telling you there's basically nothing special about it after all? Because the greatest sin of humankind is mistakingly thinking we are somehow more important than we actually are, or just as we wrongly believe ourselves to be. We are maybe important to someone or several someones, but to the univerese we are no more significant than a grain of salt.""That was how she had felt most of her life.Caught in the middle. Struggling, flailing, just trying to survive while not knowing which way to go. Which path to commit to without regret.""I related so much to Nora (give and take a few things), and maybe that's what made this book such an ""enlightening"" experience for me? I'm certain all of us, even the most optimistic ones, found himself or herself or themselves in a depressive state at least once or twice in their life. This book does not perpetuate your depression, nor does it feed it. On the contrary, it gives you a pure glance as an outsider into the mind of a struggling depressed person trying to find the will to live. And I know there are literally thousands of books about depression (which I usually can't stand readimg), and idk why but this book in particular was and is very special to me. Maybe it's the extra touch of fantasy, which I can never, for the life of me, turn down? ""She didn't want to die. And she didn't want to live any other life than the one that was hers. The one that could be a messy struggle, but it was her messy struggle. A beautiful messy struggle.""“You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”It's just amazing how I constantly got the feeling this book is the best friend I should have always had and unfortunately never did.This book should be made into a movie!_______________________________________This book really manages to grasp the concept of severe depression and revive it in the form of Nora perfectly. I'm literally trying to read as much as I possibly can in between classes. I just can't get enough! I wish I had more time to read, otherwise I would have been done with it in a heartbeat 😢_______________________________________""Between life and death there is a library. And within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?""Okay I haven't even started reading the book yet and I'm already hooked 😭_______________________________________This book sounds a bit similar to The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern, and I'm just in love with the synopsis! ♥My uni website: you have 6+ topics to study by tomorrowMy brain: "
1165,3.0,"17/25 (68%) 3 stars. This is one of these weird reviews where I have to say that while I think this is 'objectively' a good book, it still wasn't the book for me. Yes, it was a page-turner once I had time to focus on it. But only then. If I compare it to The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue - and I have to compare it to Addie LaRue - yes, the basic concept, the idea behind this book totally worked for me. It hooked me. But while I was head over heels in love with The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, my feelings for this one are lukewarm at best. Why? Because I am in love with the concept, nothing more. That's it. It's like a relationship based only on physical attraction. Or, to say it with the book itself:
""We had great times. But there is more to life than fantastic sex.""
 Yes, the pitch is great: Nora, the protagonist, is in a really dark place emotionally, overwhelmed with regrets about the decisions she's made in her life. And she gets a chance to live a life where she hasn't made the wrong decisions, where she doesn't end up in that dark place - and who can't relate to that? Having regrets is a very human thing. Regrets are one thing that sets humanity apart, because nothing else on this planet has regrets. Well, I think my cat may regret that it wasn't born as a tiger, but I can't be sure of that, so it doesn't count.  So that's the pitch. The pitch works, because every single one of us can understand Nora. We all regret something, be it that we didn't ask a certain person on a date, that we didn't choose another job, that we didn't bet a lot of money on the Patriots when they were down 3-28 in the Super Bowl. Life is full of regrets, so we can relate to Nora, just like we can relate to Addie: we all regret things, and we all want to be remembered. Pitch: check. Everything else: sorry, didn't care. Yes, I didn't care. It's a cute book, I enjoyed it, but - cold-blooded, stone-hearted monster that I am: I didn't care. Because I knew where this was going to end, and because the road there wasn't intriguing enough to make me enjoy it. Yes, there were some heartbreaking moments had to face, but in a way I kept thinking: this isn't real. No matter how often Schrödinger's Cat was mentioned, I didn't feel this was real. This wasn't like Harry and Dumbledore at King's Cross, this couldn't make me feel for the characters. It does for a lot of people, but not for me.  The prose isn't my thing. It's too reduced to reach me, it's... bland? Not sure I can say that. But it never enchants me, and there are only two quotes I marked while reading this book:
""A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts let you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a dew dodgy side-streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.""""And the thing you need to realise is this: the game is never over until it is over. It isn't over if there is a single pawn still left on the board. If one side is down to a pawn and a king, and the other side has every player, there is still a game. And even if you were a pawn - maybe we all are - then you should remember that a pawn is the most magical piece of all. It might look small and ordinary, but it isn't. Because a pawn is never just a pawn. A pawn is a queen-in-waiting. All you need to do is find a way to keep moving forward. One square after another. And you can get to the other side and unlock all kinds of power.""
 The latter one sounds like a real good pep speech, I'll try to use it for my football team at some point. Anyway, the bottom line is: it obviously works for a lot of people but it didn't work for me. It failed to deliver the X-factor, it never managed to enchant me - three stars.----Dialogue 4Setting 4Characters 3Writing Style 3Plot 3"
1166,5.0,"Nora Seed hasn't had the best week, in fact let's just say that she hasn't had the best life. Her brother who is the only family she has doesn't want anything to do with her. But after she's let go from her job and her cat dying on the same day, she can't think of living anymore and decides to commit suicide. She wakes up in a library and finds her school librarian, Mrs Elm there and Mrs Elm informs Nora that she is in an in-between place and here she has an infinite number of lives that she could choose from. All she has to do is go through The book of regrets and choose a different life and she'll end up there. If she is disappointed there, she'll come back to the midnight library and she can choose another life. 
She stepped outside, wondering whether a life could really be judged from just a few minutes after midnight on a Tuesday. Or maybe that was all you needed.
Nora tries life after life but she always ends up not liking it or being a stranger in her own life no matter how popular or how successful or how rich she is and always ends up back at the library.
Mrs Elm smiled, wryly. 'It just shows you, doesn't it?''Shows me what?''Well, that you can choose choices but not outcomes. But I stand by what I said. It was a good choice. It just wasn't a desired outcome.'
Then Mrs Elm tells Nora that maybe she should try lives where the regrets weren't obvious. Even after trying those lives and even liking one where she thought that it could be her new life, she still ends up at the midnight library and at last she understands that she won't feel at home in any of her other lives because even though technically all of those are her lives, practically she didn't live them. 
Are there any other lives at all or is it just the furnishings that change?
She does get fresh perspective through her journey and she also realizes that she wants to live.
Never underestimate the big importance of small things.
She wakes up in her root life and decides to turn everything around as her perspective has changed. That the prison wasn't the place, but the perspective. She decides to teach piano lessons and also catch up with Mrs Elm even though she doesn't remember Nora and it is not the same Mrs Elm from the midnight library. She also makes up with her brother.
May be there was no perfect life for her, but somewhere, surely, there was a life worth living.
This was such a great read. I loved the writing and I was engrossed from the very beginning. I didn't like Nora in the beginning but she grew on me and I was rooting for her throughout. I felt her journey like it was my own journey. How many times have I thought of making different decisions but I also know that if I were given the chance all over again, I would still make those exact same decisions because they felt right in my heart at the time. (view spoiler)[I suspected how it would end but more that that I wanted Nora to choose her root life right after the sadness she felt in her first alternate life and I am so very happy to know that's exactly how it ends.

1167,4.0,"Nora Seed has decided to die. No spoiler here, the book opens the early chapters with an ominous countdown to her death. In the ensuing hours Nora is let go from her job, we are reminded of the fiancé she left at the altar, the record deal she wouldn't sign breaking up a her promising band and estranging her from her brother, the Olympic swim dreams sidestepped, the lone friend on the other side of the world and to top it all off the death of her beloved cat. In death though, she finds herself in a massive library filled with an infinite number of books tended by her grade school librarian Mrs Elm. Each book represents a life. A different one driven by different choices made where she becomes a wife, pursued her Olympic dreams, stayed on as the lead singer of her band and most importantly, saved the life of her cat. Spoiler! Fame and fortune isn't a guarantee of happiness. Olympic medals, sold out international concerts, influential TedTalks aren't fulfilling on their own. Those paths not taken are no less fraught, not necessarily better. Blah, blah, blah - we've heard it all before. It's a 300 page Live, Love, Laugh poster. It reads like a novelization of a self-help book, Lord knows Matt Haig has made a name for himself examining his anxieties and working through his depressive tendencies. My rational, judgy, cynical mind knows this and is ready to dismiss it out of hand - but I'm won over by the complete earnest, unironic commitment of it all. As Haig puts it - cynicism is a luxury for the non-suicidal. It's a self-help genre novel. You know how it's going to end, the conventions it's going to explore. It's a riff on It's a Wonderful Life set in the internet era. But the getting there is no less fun. It's a mystery to unravel each life Nora slips into. What were her expectations with this choice and how will it ultimately fail her? I blazed through this in a weekend. Reading it I was gently reminded that I am enough, that we all matter in the world and there's space ahead to make changes ...but I gotta be honest, that life on a winery sounded pretty damn good to me."

1170,4.0,"""She realised that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality. As Thoreau wrote, ‘It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.""Nora Seed is ready to give it all up - her life is in the pits and she feels like she has nothing to live for. What happens next is that she finds herself in a library and every book on the shelf is a variation of her life choices, an infinite number of turns and decisions that changed an outcome. She gets to try on different lives to determine who she is and who she wants to be. She is a musician, an Olympic swimmer, and an glaciologist (so interesting). She's happy in some, unhappy in others. Every time she comes back to Mrs Elm and decides to pick up a new book.This book really warmed my heart and soul. I loved Nora and I love the story of a person coming out of the darkest depths to discover something interesting. The premise of this was overly done or too cheesy. It worked perfectly as it should, and I appreciate the nod to the science aspect of the parallel lives concept. Any book lover would enjoy this novel and I think I'll find myself slowly thinking about Nora Seed over and over again."
1171,5.0,"It is easy to mourn the lives we aren’t living. Easy to wish we’d developed other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we’d worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely been more popular.In our lives we make thousands of choices that eventually determine how our lives are lived. What if we could see how each of those choice would impact our lives and be able to choose the outcome that made up the most happy? The protagonist Nora Seed is given just that opportunity. The result is a magical realism novel that is a joy to read. A fascinating concept handled beautifully by author Matt Haig. "
1172,5.0,"Such a delicious book. No boring moments, always something happening. We get to see sooo many different lifes of Nora, it was amazing. Loved the message of the book too. And although I guessed the ending from like page 20 or so, it was still beautifully written and almost made me tear up at certain parts.It's a beautiful story, full of beautiful and inspiring quotes and one of those that, surprisingly, I wouldn't mind reading again in the future :)Definitely made me feel joy and inspired for the future."
1173,2.0,"it was overall a very disappointing read. i expected so much more depth and a better portrayal of depression and what I got was a book that felt dreadfully long and that only got one message which was basically : ""don't regret anything in your life, it could have been so much worse""🤪 it felt so dragged and i pushed myself to finish this book only because I hate leaving things unfinished 🙂"
1174,3.0,"As much as I wanted to like this book, I found it depressing, lackluster and droll. While the concept of a mystical library that grants wishes of unfulfilled lives is unique, something about Nora left me cold and her fantasies as well. Regardless of the high ratings from others I can't say I'd recommend it unless you enjoy characters who want to die in order to escape life."

1178,2.0,"Un libro monótono y no apto para aquellas personas que no somos fans de leer autoayuda. Con tanta buena crítica, yo esperaba acabar encandilada con la historia, pero se ve que me toca ir a contracorriente y decir que la lectura me ha resultado un tostón en muchos instantes.La base es original y podría haber dado mucho de sí. Conocemos a Nora, la protagonista, decidiendo que su vida ya no tiene sentido y que estaría mejor muerta. Tras tomar una drástica decisión y ejecutarla, Nora se ve transportada a la Biblioteca de la Medianoche, un lugar que le ofrece la oportunidad de experimentar todas aquellas vidas que hubiera tenido si sus elecciones a lo largo de los años hubieran sido diferentes a las que escogió. La cosa pintaba bien, realmente bien, pero pronto me di cuenta de que no iba a tener ni de lejos la emoción que yo esperaba. La historia es un bucle sin fin en el que la emoción brilla por su ausencia y cuyo final es fácil de predecir.Lo de Nora es curioso, pero ella no se cuestiona en exceso la situación tan extraordinaria que está viviendo. Lo más importante parece ser ponernos a filosofar y tener que tragarnos una cantidad incontable de reflexiones dignas de un libro de autoayuda. Yo respeto totalmente a la gente que ama leer autoayuda, en serio, cada cual que lea lo que le haga feliz, pero a mí me aburre soberanamente que me estén incordiando con frasesitas que dan a entender que siempre le puedes ver el lado bueno a todo. Y no solo eso, sino que considero que son cosas que son fáciles de deducir, la cuestión es que en la práctica es complicado estar constantemente en modo happy y agradeciendo cada segundo hasta el aire que respiras. Desde mi punto de vista, la trama de esta novela queda diluida en medio de tanto ensalzamiento de ese tipo de pensamientos. Vale que a veces Nora sufre, pero es que parece una caprichosa queriendo eliminar cualquier tipo de dolor.Aunque parezca increíble, ni siquiera se dan demasiados sucesos. No importa que a lo largo de la lectura vayamos viendo a Nora experimentar múltiples vidas y, en teoría, ir madurando. Vista una vida, vistas todas. En mi caso, nunca tuve la menor duda de que Nora iba a encontrar en todas un “pero” para alegar que no la convencían y que esa tampoco hubiera sido la existencia que hubiera deseado tener. Y sí, ya me imagino que el propósito del autor era dar a entender que es que hay que aprender que no se puede tener una vida 100% perfecta, pero eso le resta emoción a lo que le ocurre a Nora. Además, si me pusiera tiquismiquis, ni siquiera estaría convencida de la gran variedad de cambios de una vida a otra, ya que los efectos colaterales en otras personas me parecían exagerados. Pero bueno, voy a obviar eso, ya que, en verdad, mi mayor problema fue leer y no sentir nada. Vi frialdad en la narración y poca implicación por parte de la protagonista. Me hubiera gustado que se cuestionara más cosas y que no viera tan normal ser capaz de meterse tan de lleno en algunos asuntos.No le doy un 1/5 porque en algunas partes notaba que la lectura se aligeraba y era fácil avanzar. A esto hay que sumarle que los capítulos eran muy breves, así que eso también era muy de agradecer. Y bueno, admito que en el tramo final sí que me dio la impresión de que Nora por fin se paraba a pensar de verdad en los pros y contras de lo que le estaba ocurriendo y eso le aportó un toque de realismo a la historia. Eso sí, para mí, el desenlace fue el esperado. Creo que si hubiera sido de otra manera, hubiera sido ilógico con todo lo visto anteriormente y encima hubiera echado por tierra el propósito que intuyo que tenía el autor.No os digo que no lo leáis, ya que puede que vosotros lo améis. Yo simplemente os diría que no vayáis con las expectativas a tope porque os puede decepcionar si pretendéis que se centre más en la trama que en las reflexiones. "
1179,5.0,"The Humans by Matt Haig was the first book I ever reviewed on my blog and is the reason I became a book blogger. I've made no secret of how much that book means to me - I read it a few months after my brother took his life and it became my beacon of light at a dark time. It's a bittersweet coincidence then that The Midnight Library was published on the eighth anniversary of my brother's suicide and that the lead character, Nora Seed should be suicidal herself.I can't pretend that the early chapters were easy to read - over the course of a few days Nora reaches the point where she decides that she wants to die - but I was reading it during what is always an emotional week for me. As the story progresses, Nora is given the opportunity to explore what her life could have been like had she made other choices or decisions as Matt Haig returns to the life-affirming themes I have come to associate with his books. Written with deep understanding and warm-hearted honesty; The Midnight Library is a thought-provoking, perceptive paean to hope and the power of books.Nora learns that she can undo her regrets and in her Midnight Library, guided by her old school librarian, Mrs Elms, the books on the shelves are filled with her alternative lives. As she hovers between life and death in her original or 'root' life, she is able to experience what it would have been like to have followed her dreams or even just agreed to a coffee. If she ever finds a life she likes, she'll be able to stay in it and will eventually forget the Midnight Library. She might run a country pub with her husband (the man she jilted just before her wedding in her root life), be a glaciologist working alongside other scientists in the Arctic or perform to packed out stadiums as a world-famous rock star. However, it turns out that no matter how exciting or interesting her life may be, she keeps returning to the library. Although there are an infinite number of lives contained in the books, if Nora dies the library and everything in it will be destroyed. My favourite film of all time is It's a Wonderful Life and there are elements of The Midnight Library that are reminiscent of that story. Just as George Bailey was forced to put his dreams on hold time and again, so Nora is filled with regrets for what she has lost or missed out on. Both George and Nora feel trapped and stifled in their home towns but George has Clarence to show him what he means to the people of Bedford Falls and it can't be a coincidence that Mrs Elms is there to guide Nora towards finding out that her actions affected more than just her own life in Bedford. This is an uplifting novel but like It's a Wonderful Life, it has a darker side and doesn't forget that life can be difficult and painful. There is no Mr Potter here but Nora's own personal villain is her depression and that she has allowed her regrets to define who she believes she is; as always Matt Haig writes about mental health issues with compassionate insight and sensitivity. The Midnight Library may be a fantastical premise but it is never false and through an accessible and engaging mix of quantum physics. philosophy and love, Matt Haig tells a beautiful, poignant and empathetic story of redemption and hope. The Midnight Library is the perfect reminder that even when times are tough, it can still be a wonderful life. "
1180,5.0,"Pure MAGIE! Pure Faszination ist was ich bei diesem Buch gespürt habe als ich die vielen Lebensvarianten von Nora Seed erleben durfte!Als super Schwimmerin, super Brain, mit erfolgreichem Studienabschluss in Philosophie stellt Nora Seed den typischen Charakter dar, der vollem Erfolgsdruck ausgesetzt ist. Was jedoch in der Regel eintritt ist das Leben und das ist nun mal kein Wunschkonzert!Nora Seed ist 35 Jahre alt und zieht eine Bilanz in ihrem Leben: sie hat einen Job ohne Perspektive, sie stieg aus der Musikbande aus und zog dadurch den Groll ihres Bruders auf sich, sie ist mega enttäuscht darüber, dass sie nie eine Familie gegründet hat, geschweige denn jemals die innige Liebe ihres Lebens gefunden hat. In Selbstmitleid suhlend, im freien Fall eines Abends um 23:22 Uhr, überwältigt von einem Schwarm von Reuegefühlen, voller Gram, erlegen ihrer Tabletten Abhängigkeit, entscheidet Nora, sich das Leben zu nehmen. Um 0:00 Uhr, mitternachts, begeht sie jedoch eine Bibliothek in Nebelschwaden und wird von Frau Elm, ihrer ehemalige Bibliothekarin, aufgeklärt, dass sie sich nicht im Jenseits befindet, sondern, dass sie auf dem Weg dorthin ist, sich also zwischen Leben und Tod bewegt. Umringt von Büchern, die von mannigfaltigen Versionen ihres Lebens handeln, wird Nora Seed diese am eigenen Leibe erfahren, wie das Leben jeweils wäre, wenn sie eine andere Entscheidung gefällt hätte. Man lernt eben nur, wenn man lebt, so Frau Elm. Empfindet Nora jedoch die Enttäuschung einer ihrer Lebensvarianten in vollen Zügen, kommt sie zurück in die Mitternachtsbibliothek und experimentiert eine andere Variante. So kann sie sich die Möglichkeiten zwar auswählen, aber nicht den Ausgang. Was sie auf alle Fälle braucht, ist der Wille weiter zu machen, nur dann wird das ausgesuchte Leben ein Geschenk 🎁.Ich habe es einfach geliebt, Nora auf ihren abenteuerlichen Lebensvarianten zu begleiten und mitzuerleben wie sie sich gemacht und gefühlt hat in ihrer Rolle als Karrierefrau, als Schwimmerin bei den Olympischen Spielen oder Ehefrau eines Mexikanisch-Amerikaners auf einem Weingut in Kalifornien oder als Beach-Girl in Australien oder als Gletscherforscherin oder als Mutter von Molly und Ehefrau von Ash, dem Chirurgen, dessen Einladung sie mal abgelehnt hatte, weil sie mit Dan zusammen war. Hätte sie das angebliche Bilderbuchleben, wofür sich die heutige Gesellschaft auf sozialen Medien rühmt? Wir werden sehen! Bis dahin jedoch, genieße ich das Aroma des Getränks, das vor mir steht 😋 und öffne die erste Seite meines neuen Buches, nämlich ein unbeschriebenes Blatt 😉. La vie est belle 💕 Carpe diem 🌾🍀🪴"
1181,3.0,"The Midnight Library is a charming and whimsical spin on life's many woulda, shoulda, coulda moments and the liminal spaces we inhabit as we make, and regret, choices large and small. It's a poignant interlude that lingers, if not in substance, at least in style. Nora Seed generally copes with a low-grade depression that has stalled her life's forward momentum. But after being fired from her job and losing her beloved cat, she attempts suicide by overdosing on pills. As she passes out, she passes into the Midnight Library, where Mrs. Elm, a librarian from her schoolgirl days, awaits to guide her through the endless shelves of books that tell the stories of the endless array of her life choices. Each volume in the Midnight Library is a life Nora has led in this choose-your-own-adventure universe. We already know that Nora had the potential to be a world-class swimmer, or a chart-topping rock star, or the wife of Dan, an affable guy who aspires to own a country pub, that her beloved mother has passed and she's estranged from her older brother, and so we enter into lives Nora has lived where these possibilities and avenues are explored and fully realized. Nora has the option of settling into the one life in which she is truly happy. You can imagine where we are headed (SPOILER ALERT): of course the life where we first meet Nora is the one she's meant to be in all along. I struggled with the facile approach to depression, which confounds chronic depression with temporary, situational sadness, sending a message that if you just ""Buck Up, Little Camper!"" it'll all be okay. It's not that using humor to approach a narrative about mental illness isn't effective, it's just that it's been done so much better (see: everything by Allie Brosh, Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman; much of Kate Atkinson's work, ditto Mark Haddon). The repetition of jumping into Nora's lives felt formulaic after the first two or so, until I found myself skimming through the filler bits. But Nora herself is irresistible; the charm of watching her humble self navigating the surprises as she enters into each life is worth the price of admission.This novel is like the elderly man in the coffee shop sitting at the table beside yours who wants to chat just as you are settling in to get some work done. But you hold off on opening your laptop and instead allow yourself to be present in another's open-hearted, uncomplicated company. Relieve yourself of expectations and just enjoy."

If you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail. Aim to be you. Aim to look and act and think like you. Aim to be the truest version of you. Embrace that you-ness. Endorse it. Love it. Work hard at it. And don’t give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it. Most gossip is envy in disguise. Keep your head down. Keep your stamina. Keep swimming.
Oh wow! I had no idea that I was going to love this as much as I did. I needed this book right now.Nora Seed struggles with depression and finding not only the will to live, but also the version of her life that makes her happy. It was interesting to see Nora explore different versions of her live and seeing how she reacted to them. I wish I could do that. I doubt I'd choose the version I'm in now. But who knows, maybe I still would. There were many relatable and quotable moments in this book and I loved the philosophy lessons. I needed to hear them right now. I was about 75% through the audiobook when I realized that I needed to own the book, so I ordered the hardback. I feel like Matt Haig understands my personal struggles. Even in all of Nora’s chaotic lives, I feel more hopeful about my own. The future is still a blank page that I can fill in any way I choose. I just have to live rather than merely to exist. The Midnight Library is a must-read for readers who love character-driven novels that dive deep into the meaning of life."

Depresyon, panik atak, kayıp ve yas psikolojisine dair bir şeyler okurken -akademik bir okuma değilse- yoğun ve yorucu bir dil en son isteyeceğiniz seçeneklerden birisi.

1185,5.0,"If parallel universes and alternate realities exist, which life would you choose? This terrific new fantasy novel explores what happens when one young woman is given the chance. Nora Seed, who has passed up many opportunities in her rather sad life, decides to end it all one rainy night, and wakes to find herself in....a library! 'Between life and death there is a library. And within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices...Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?'I thoroughly enjoyed this story which explores what is important and meaningful in life through Nora's experiences. What make a life worth living? I received an arc from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for my honest review. I am very grateful for the opportunity. "
1186,4.0,"3.5Nice. A bit preachy but that was the point. Perfect to send you into a life crisis. I get the hype and why so many people found it relatable. The ending was kinda predictable. Good read for everyone who feels stuck in life.Personally, I know exactly what kind of universe I want to live in and I'm sure it wouldn't take me long to stick with one. I know she was in a bad place and I get why she turned down so many offers, but sometimes I was like ""Really? Nothing is good enough for you? What do you really want?"". I know that wasn't the point, it was just the side of me that desperately wanted to manifest such a library. Of course you lose things along the way and you make choices at the cost of other choices, but it's only a matter of priorities and what you want more. And what makes you happy."

It sure makes one think about their options and potential."
1188,1.0,"honestly, I found it very repetitive, predictable and kind of cringey. full of naff ""inspirational"" quotes that are more like common sense (""the only way to learn is to live"" or ""never underestimate the big importance of small things"").

1191,3.0,Frustratingly predictable...
1192,3.0,"I know this is the type of book that would normally managed to keep me on my toes and properly invested but I do not know if it was the lack of attention today or reading this while I was completely feeling sleepy, I simply could not enjoy it as much as I wanted to. Also it could be the simple fact that I raced through three short books in one day mainly due to the fact that I was given a sudden announcement that I would be starting work tomorrow when the original date was supposed to be another week and half away and I had planned the books I’d be reading for those weeks and now everything is in shambles. I hate it when plans are ruined. For me this was the first Matt Haig book and I could see what captured the whole world in his writing. As I mentioned above, generally it would captivate me too but this time I was only left with the feeling that I should quickly take a paracetamol after this. It had nothing to do with the book, the paracetamol but rather with my nap exceeding it’s usual 20 minutes and I was left with a raging headache. The fact that I’m writing more about other things than the book itself shows I was not invested in it as I should had so let me stop wasting your time as much as mine. Also there are much better reviews in terms for this book. Maybe I will take a break next or maybe five straight into another. I am supposed to be getting three more books today (remember how I planned to read for the next week and a half?) but unfortunately it’s not here yet. If you’re anything like me and likes to read a book once in awhile that would leave you speechless I would recommend to read this. Despite none than stellar review, I still believe the book itself is worth reading. "
1193,4.0,"""It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see"".Regrets, Choices, Chances, Decisions, Closures, and Acceptances… Those are the 6 BIG words that came into mind after reading ""The Midnight Library."" Nora Seed, at 35, is hopeless, helpless, and lost. She is at the point of giving up life. Sad… but many could relate to her for this. Just at the brink of death, she found her way into a mystical library filled with many books detailing the possibilities and potentials where one's life could have a different version. Nora is faced with decisions to change her life for the better, followed another career, undoing a mess-up relationship, and perhaps go after her passion. At the heart of the book, the beautiful concept derived from philosophical multiple universe theory develops from every choice and decision, though it was not discussed in depth. The focus is mainly on Nora's disposition to go on living or to end it all. Nora's depressive and indecisive character may seem languid but good enough to be contemplative. An introspective book that ended on a crucial note leaving meditative thoughts about life in perspective. The narrative is pleasant, engaging, and comfortable, liken to a magical story where it can foster one's imagination for a good night's dream. Eventually, as I followed Nora's journey in her life, I realized no perfect life. Still, there's ONE life with lessons from mistakes, closure to regrets, acceptance of failures, and lastly, being patient with life as it unfolds in bad times and good times."

1195,4.0,"After seeing this one all over bookstagram I finally got to pick this one up. The concept is so unique and I loved seeing how a change in Nora’s decision led to a different life. It really gets you thinking of how true that is, where we are now is based on hundreds of decisions we have made in the past. I did find some parts repetitive and I wasn’t entirely sucked. I also felt like this book was trying to portray strong underlying messages about life and regrets but it was done in a way that felt fake and forced. Overall this was a good thriller break for me and I can see how it’s so loved and the Goodreads fiction winner for 2020. "
1196,3.0,"QUICK TAKE: I wanted to love it, but I had issues with THE MIDNIGHT LIBRARY...mainly, that I never connected to supporting characters in this story as they're not properly introduced in the beginning, so as our lead character lives out alternate versions of her life, you're never able to connect in an emotional way to the other people in her life or their interpersonal relationships.

And you will then hold on to Nora for dear life because you are about to go into nooks and crannies of your life that I could not possibly understand, as you could not possibly understand mine. That is the brilliance of this book.Matt Haig has found a pattern, a template, a way to make us think we are reading a book about a fictional troubled girl, but you will be slipped in, and handcuffed to her without even knowing it. When she lands in the library, all of a sudden you will be there, too, wondering if your books are on shelves somewhere. Then later, when a variation is provided on that theme there will be a little *POP* as you realize maybe yours isn't a library at all. . . .again!

1205,4.0,"In this book, protagonist Nora Seed is dissatisfied with life. She finds herself in the Midnight Library, staffed by a beloved librarian from Nora’s past. The librarian offers her the chance to select a book from the shelves, which, when opened, allows her to experience a different version of her life based on making different decisions in course of her life. If she finds an acceptable new path, she can remain. If not, she can return and select another book to sample another life based on different decisions. If she dies in her “root” life, the library will cease to exist.This book portrays the various ideas of happiness – where Nora’s life is “successful” based on money, fame, accomplishments, and relationships. She chooses different partners, specialties, and locations. These vignettes introduce humor into the narrative, as Nora finds herself talking to people who know her, but she does not know them, nor does she know the context up to the point where she joined this particular version of her life. For me, the only drawback is that it sometimes takes Nora almost no time to determine a particular version of her life is not to her liking (this happens, as you may expect, numerous times). I enjoy Matt Haig’s writing style and appreciate his desire to help those suffering from depression. It is a creative take on the concept of a multiverse. "

Cada um dos livros oferece-te a possibilidade de viveres outra vida que podias ter vivido. Permitem-te ver como as coisas podiam ter sido diferentes se tivesses feito outras escolhas…”Nora vive uma vida, no seu entender, sem sentido, aborrecida, onde tudo corre mal, sem amor, com medo de falhar e sem vontade de arriscar, tudo se resume ao que podia ter sido. Por vezes, o grande problema das nossas vidas é muito idêntico aos problemas da Nora. Por vezes, só precisamos de uma oportunidade para viver a vida de outra forma, ou até para aprender a viver a vida da melhor forma. Por vezes, vivemos também os sonhos das pessoas à nossa volta e não os nossos: o casamento, os filhos, a viagem de sonho, aquele emprego, aquele deporto. São mesmo coisas de que gostamos e nos fazem felizes ou são apenas coisas que fazem felizes os que estão à nossa volta?Eu confesso que apesar de toda a vibe à volta do livro, não ficou um favorito. Percebi a mensagem, acho relevante, mas aborreci-me com as vidas todas e achei até confusa a ideia ao início. No entanto, reforço que a mensagem do livro é muito importante, principalmente para os mais distraídos. Vivam, amem-se, não tenham medo. Apesar de tudo, só se vive uma vez. "
1207,4.0,"Haig sets the foundation for a life-after-life book very creatively here! I won't go into the plot since hundreds of others have done that. What was nerve-racking for me as I read it is that Nora didn't know anything about the new lives she jumped into. Sure, she could google herself at times, but not knowing the polar caps science or words of songs she wrote or even the names of a husband/child? While I enjoyed all the adventures she had, that part made me nervous each and every time. I wondered if Nora's name (Nora Seed) was a pun, such as Luna Seed. Another reviewer pointed out that the librarian's initials were L.I.E., and the idea that depression ""lies"" to you in painting a black outlook. Just enough philosophy and physics. I thought it was interesting that there was a book of ""regrets"", not ""mistakes"" and that her interests steered her as much as the people involved. Hey cats, don't feel so smug now with your nine lives, do ya? "

My two dogs are my whole life right now and I love them with all my heart.That being said, this drives into thinking of taking her own life. It just doesn't matter anymore. So she enters the midnight library and from there she gets endless opportunities to see what her life could be like. Honestly, this whole idea sounds so freaking cool. I've never had this moment in my life but if I did, and I went to the library, I'm sure my opinion on everything would've changed for the better. Mostly because life is worth living. Everyone goes through the good and bad times but the main thing is - we live. In the end, this book was definitely a favorite of mine. I loved everything about this and definitely recommend it."

And perhaps he has a point. In his view, regrets occur because of alternative histories we fabricate for ourselves in which disappointment with one’s lot is reduced or eliminated because life would be more fulfilling/successful/happy than the life one actually has. Depression, in other words, is a literary phenomenon. It’s a result of the what-if stories. Imaginative, articulate people, therefore, would be particularly susceptible to the condition. There is in fact substantial anecdotal evidence that this might be so (see, for example, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)""Based on this essentially linguistic theory of depression, Haig has a suggestion for therapy. At this point he crosses the line from playful fictional speculation to a less than savoury quackery… I think it clear that The Midnight Library is a grave insult to those suffering from depression. It is a facile, trivial, misdirected, and (did I mention?) cheesy book.” Laura Noggle points to some well-crafted paragraphs: “A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.” She notes: “Entertaining, but also felt like an adaptation of the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future.”Jonathan K concludes: “As much as I wanted to like this book, I found it depressing, lackluster and droll. While the concept of a mystical library that grants wishes of unfulfilled lives is unique, something about Nora left me cold and her fantasies as well.”""‘Want,’ she told her, in a measured tone, ‘is an interesting word. It means lack. Sometimes if we fill that lack with something else the original want disappears entirely.""There are some places where Haig isn’t content to let us follow Nora’s path of discovery and I could find little justification for this manipulation outside of his lack of confidence in his readers. There are other places where his narrative is just sloppy.I could not find anything to fill the lack with and, thus, my want persists."
1213,4.0,"*www.onewomansbbr.wordpress.com*www.facebook.com/onewomansbbrThe Midnight Library by Matt Haig. (2020). Between life and death there is a library. When Nora finds herself in the Midnight Library, she has a chance to make things right. Her life is full of misery and regret but the books in the Midnight Library enable Nora to live as if she had done things differently. She can undo her regrets as she tries to work out her perfect life. But things aren't always what she imagined they'd be, and soon her choices place the library and herself in extreme danger. Before time runs out, she must answer the ultimate question: what is the best way to live? I really enjoyed the concept of this novel. When Nora decides to end her life, she ends up in this limbo which is a library full of books of each life she could have had if she had made any decisions differently, big or small. She is given the opportunity to experience these lives, returning to the library as soon as she is disappointed in the life. I think most of us has moments where they ponder on what life would be like if you'd done something different so I believe a lot of readers would be intrigued by this novel. It is certainly depressing at times, but I think it's also realistic; the grass isn't always greener on the other side after all. At under 300 pages this isn't a long read and I found myself completely absorbed. I would very much recommend for anyone looking for something different to read, and of course anyone who finds the synopsis intriguing."
1214,4.0," ‘Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?’  This was one of my most anticipated reads of the year. It had me at ‘library that contains an infinite number of books’. Then there’s my mild obsession with all things multiverse and my knowing that there isn’t a version of me that doesn’t end up reading this book. I was so hyped up about this book that I preordered three different versions of it. (Sorry, bank account …)What I didn’t expect was to come to the realisation that I didn’t actually like Nora. It took almost no time at all for me to begin resenting her for squandering her potential. She was intelligent and gifted in various disciplines but she bailed on multiple opportunities that most people could only dream of having. Even though I also acknowledged and empathised with the pain she’d experienced, it still took a long time for me to stop being distracted by the privilege she took for granted.  ‘Never underestimate the big importance of small things.’  I loved the idea of being able to test drive different versions of the life that could have been, although it did raise some questions for me. Some were addressed in this book but others are still ticking over in my mind.Nora inhabits the bodies of a number of different versions of herself, all living lives that could potentially have been hers. When she returns to the library the other Noras resume their lives. Nora’s actions in a borrowed life could easily result in consequences that would derail an aspect of the life of the Nora that lives there, and I wondered if I would chance that if I was in her place. I’d hate to think that me acting in an unintentionally careless way could have real world consequences for another version of me.If someone who has their own version of the Midnight Library chooses to stay in one of the lives they visit, what happens to the version of themselves who lived there first? Do they die? Swap existences with the interloper? Or is their existence undone entirely? Also, if you remain in another version of your life, could you ever truly feel like you belong or would you constantly feel like you need to fake knowing people that weren’t a part of your original life?I did eventually get over my initial resentment/envy of Nora’s many opportunities and settled into exploring each new possible life with her. There were some lives I wanted to visit longer and others I wanted to escape from almost immediately. It seemed obvious from early on where Nora’s story was leading. One thing that I hadn’t given much thought to in the context of this story prior to reading it was the impact that Nora’s choices in life, big and small, would have on the other people in her life. In this respect it reminded me of The Butterfly Effect, although Nora’s story is nowhere near as dark as Evan’s. Paulo Coelho’s Veronika Decides to Die and Robert Frost’s The Road Not Taken also popped into my mind as I was reading.I wound up thinking a lot about who my Mrs Elm would be and the form that my Midnight Library would take. While my Library would have books (obviously!), I’m still not entirely sure who my Mrs Elm is. I don’t know if it’s possible to read this book without thinking about your own regrets. Equally, I don’t know if it’s possible to read this book without considering the changes you could make in your life to erase them.The story is told quite simply. It seemed to me to be part cautionary tale, part self help book and part Philosophy 101.  ‘Now go on, live, while you still have the chance.’  Content warnings include (view spoiler)[alcoholism, death by suicide, grief, mental health, self harm, suicidal ideation and attempt (hide spoiler)].Blog - https://schizanthusnerd.com"

1216,5.0,"The Midnight Library by Matt HaigTHE MIDNIGHT LIBRARY was a quick and engaging read. Nora Seed attempts to commit suicide and wakes up in a library run by an influential person from her past. The library has seemingly unlimited books and surprisingly they all relate to her life… thousands and thousands of possibilities and all of them based on her life. One book on her life as it was and thousands of others that indicated what it might have been having chosen a slightly different path. One large volume held all of her regrets…. I found this book's premise so intriguing, the idea of hidden multiple plains where one might see what their life would have been had a slightly different choice been made. Sort of a modern-day “It's a Wonderful Life” (1946)…. With differences. In fact, the library rather made me think of “The Starless Sea” with the…. I don’t know the dreamy atmosphere of hidden passages. At any rate, I really enjoyed the book and look forward to reading the future work of Matt Haig, whom I had not read before this. I appreciate the “quirky twist” his work offered so I recommend it highly. 5 starsHappy Reading!"
1217,5.0,"It's a Wonderful Life meets Groundhog Day. This is one of those books that does what books are supposed to do--pull you in again and again with the need to know ""what's gonna happen?"" I started this book after abruptly quitting on a previous one that triggered my anxiety out of the blue. I almost quit this one too after realizing it was about yet another depressed millennial. But it grabbed me, and even if it's a little on the nose here and there, it was a pitch perfect plot and character arc in others. It spoke encouraging truths to me, and I loved it."

1220,5.0,"Conocí este libro a través de los premios que otorga Goodreads anualmente y en cuanto leí el argumento me llamó muchísimo la atención y apunté la fecha en que salía la edición española. ¿Qué quiere decir esto? Pues que tenía grandes expectativas sobre su lectura. Cuando salió empecé a ver que a amigos de GR no les había gustado y me desinflé un poco, pero la historia seguía tirando de mí así que me decidí a hacerme con él.¿Ha cumplido mis expectativas? Pues la verdad es que sí. Me ha gustado mucho como está escrito y la originalidad de la biblioteca ¿A quién no le gustaría poder visitar un sitio así? Probar que hubiera pasado si…. vivir otras vidas generadas por pequeños cambios o grandes cambios, vidas muy diferentes o quizás no tanto. ¿Y si pudiéramos analizar nuestro libro de los arrepentimientos? ¿Cuántos creéis que tendríais?  “Entre la vida y la tierra, hay una biblioteca y dentro de esa biblioteca, los estantes son eternos. Cada libro te da la oportunidad de probar otra vida que podrías haber vivido. Para ver cómo serían las cosas si hubieras tomado otras decisiones... ¿Habrías hecho algo diferente, si tuvieras la oportunidad de deshacer tus arrepentimientos.”Este libro habla de desesperación, de no poder más, de como las cosas van sumando hasta crear un mejunje espeso de negrura que te envuelve como un traje de neopreno que se te pega al cuerpo y no te lo puedes quitar. Habla de soledad, de la importancia de estar conectada con otras personas y lo que su falta ocasiona. Habla de la importancia de las pequeñas cosas, de como hasta la más pequeña decisión puede modificar la trayectoria del devenir, al estilo del efecto mariposa.  ""Cada vida contiene muchos millones de decisiones. Algunas grandes, otras pequeñas, pero cada vez que se toma una decisión en lugar de otra, los resultados difieren. Se produce una variación irreversible.""Con Nora podemos sentir su frustración, sus necesidades no cubiertas, su necesidad de ser vista, de ser mirada desde el amor en todas sus vertientes.Puede parecer un libro triste y en algunos momentos lo es, no lo niego, este autor escribe desde el autoconocimiento que posee de lo que es que la vida te sobrepase. A pesar de que podemos sentir la desesperanza de Nora, a lo largo de la historia podemos ir con ella, arrancando trocitos de esa desesperanza para ir rellenando los agujeros que ésta deja con pequeñas cosas que merecen ser vivida. Es lo primero que leo de él pero por las reseñas que he leído de otros libros siempre rezuma algo de tristeza y a la vez de esperanza, él salió del hoyo, sus personajes imagino que reflejan esta lucha interna que debió vivir. De hecho tiene un ensayo autobiográfico “Razones para seguir viviendo” en el que cuenta como vivió su enfermedad mental.En definitiva que he disfrutado mucho de esta lectura, de la teoría de cuerdas, de las píldoras que da para superar esos momentos difíciles y por supuesto de la biblioteca.Me quedo con la frase:  “No tienes que entender la vida, tienes que vivirla""."

Forse capita così nella maggior parte delle vite.Sinceramente non mi sarei mai aspettata che questo libro mi prendesse così tanto. Mi ha sconvolto, in un certo senso mi ha aggrovigliato le budella e bucato l’anima. Ho pianto che neanche me ne capacito! La storia di Nora, potrebbe essere una storia come tante, una vita come tante. Ha perso entrambi i genitori, ha allentato i rapporti sia con suo fratello che con la sua migliore amica, che si è trasferita in Australia. Nora sente di aver deluso tutti, sente di non aver costruito nulla, di non contare più nulla. Perché vive? Perché continua a svegliarsi ogni mattina e ad alzarsi dal letto?Nora ha come unica amica la depressione, un’amica cupa, oscura, che le mostra solo il peggio. Il peggio per Nora arriva una sera e continua con il mattino seguente, in poche ore Nora perde il suo gatto (l’unico essere vivente che la faceva sentire ancora utile) e il suo lavoro. Nora quindi decide di morire, di farla finita per sempre. Si imbottisce di farmaci e chiude gli occhi, ma quando li riapre Nora non è morta, è nella Biblioteca di Mezzanotte, un luogo che si trova nel mezzo. In questo luogo magico, Nora avrà la possibilità di vivere tutte le vite che aveva sempre desiderato ed anche di più, vivrà vite vere, vite che se la soddisferanno le daranno la possibilità di aprire gli occhi ed avere, da quel momento, ogni cosa desiderata che spazierà dalla fama, al successo, al denaro, alla semplicità. Per Nora e per il lettore, sarà un’avventura in piena regola, un viaggio nello spirito, un percorso sul significato dei rimpianti e sull’importanza di essi. Personalmente questo libro mi ha colpito al cuore, mi ha sconvolto per la sua profondità, la delicatezza con qui tratta temi importanti e profondi.Haig però non fa sì che il lettore provi pena per Nora, perché Nora come ogni essere umano su questo pianeta, è frutto delle proprie scelte. La vita le ha messo di fronte delle dure prove, ma è sempre stata data a Nora la possibilità di cercare la soluzione migliore.Ho amato tutto. TUTTO. 💕🔝😻Matt Haig mi ha colpito per la sua scrittura delicata e realistica, per il modo in cui descrive senza abbellimenti l’aspetto più buio dell’animo umano, non ha paura di nominare le malattie dell’animo, i pensieri che sicuramente, durante un periodo della vita hanno riguardato ognuno di noi.Chi non si è mai sentito insoddisfatto, chi non hai mai pensato di aver commesso un errore, chi non ha mai creduto di aver sbagliato tutto?Grazie, Matt Haig, mi hai ricordato che le mie scelte, magari non sempre giuste, hanno però cambiato la mia vita, mi hanno aperto comunque a nuove possibilità. Grazie per avermi fatto piangere ogni lacrima possibile, grazie perché, una volta chiuso il libro mi sono sentita percorrere del sentimento più bello in assoluto: la speranza per il futuro!🌈CONSIGLIATISSIMO!🔝"

1225,4.0,"O que dizer do livro com mais ℎ𝑦𝑝𝑒 dos últimos tempos? Em poucas palavras:É perfeito para quem ainda acha que a sua vida não é suficientemente boa como gostaria.Quantas vezes damos por nós a pensar (e verbalizar), que não gostamos do rumo da nossa existência, que estamos fartos dos caminhos sinuosos das nossas decisões, que nada de bom nos acontece e o futuro parece uma nuvem negra a pairar sobre as nossas cabeças? Quem nunca! A Biblioteca da Meia-Noite é aquele lugar (metafórico), entre a vida e a morte, onde cada livro é uma vida que poderíamos ter ou não gostado viver. E acompanhar a Nora Seed nesta viagem, faz-nos refletir (e muito), sobre a saúde mental e o poder do livre arbítrio.A premissa deste livro de Matt Haig é fabulosa, e só não foi um 5 estrelas, porque na minha humilde opinião, merecia um epílogo. Tornaria a personagem principal, muito mais completa.No meio de tópicos tão pesados como o suicídio, a depressão, arrependimento e decisões difíceis, damos de caras com um livro carregado de esperança, compaixão e gratidão!Tentei encarar cada página desta história como uma sessão terapêutica, a interiorizar que quer queiramos quer não, os arrependimentos têm de ser carregados às “costas” até ao fim dos nossos dias. Faz parte do processo.“You don’t have to understand life, you just have to live it”. - Matt Haig"

Y, sí, este es un libro que te pega bastantes patadas emocionales, que te estruja el corazón y te duele, pero también te da esperanza, te muestra lo importante de la salud mental, de los pequeños detalles, y las segundas oportunidades, el empujón para seguir adelante cuando parece que todo está en nuestra contra.

I don't mind suspending belief most of the time, I was just expecting a realistic type of suspense story.Lot's of GR friends loved this one, so perhaps I was expecting something a little more fast paced/captivating with a better pay off.

“Don’t Ask a Question You Don’t Want the Answer To.”The Last Thing He Told Me 
 is a mystery/domestic suspense about a man living a lie and his wife and daughter who struggle to discover who he really is When Hannah Hall receives a note from her husband stating nothing more than “Protect her,” one random afternoon, her whole world shatters. Her husband Owen has disappeared without a trace, and she soon learns that he was not the man she thought he was. Charged with taking care of her contentious stepdaughter, Bailey, she and Bailey slowly begin to investigate Owen leading them to danger and a startling revelation.This was my first Laura Dave book, and she hooked me right from the start. Her writing style, the characters, the plot, and the pacing felt authentic.  Hannah narrates events in the present moment, but we also get flashbacks to her marriage to Owen. It helped that Hannah doesn’t feel sorry for herself. Her emotions are subtle, real, and honest. While the mystery of Owen’s past is intriguing, the strength of this book lies in the characters. This is not as much about Hannah's relationship with Owen, but more about her relationship with Bailey.  I didn’t love the epilogue, but it does offer some closure. Overall, I absolutely loved this book and can't wait to read more by Laura Dave!I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Simon & Schuster in exchange for an honest review."

Meet Hannah, in her early forties, earning her living by carving woods, a true artist raised by her grandpa, suffering from the absence of her mom in her entire life, finally settles in her suburban life in Sausalito, married with Owen who works in tech company, trying to be a mother to his 16 years old girl Bailey even though she makes everything in her power to make things harder for her!  Her husband teases her to be absentminded. She loses everything like cellphones, sunglasses, baseball hats, socks, lightbulbs, mittens, parking ticket etc. And one day she loses her husband! Wait! She doesn’t lose him! He just sends her a note via 12 years old girl who bumped into his daughter’s school. The note says: “Protect her!” Protect who? From whom? What’s going on? Why the hell her husband doesn’t open his phone? On the news she finds out FBI arrested Owen’s boss because of scandalous tech scheme! Is his husband involved with the scheme? He was stressed because of the work lately.  And why FBI is sniffing around their house and why U. S. Marshall from Texas insists to help her even though this case is out of his jurisdiction! And after calling his ex to defend her as their family lawyer, the investigator her ex hired finds out the ugly truth: her husband’s name is not Owen! He was not graduated from Princeton! He was not from Massachusetts!  Who was her husband? Who was after him? Was it about the company’s fall out or was it something shadier than that which would force them to run away throughout their entire lives? It was fast pacing, engaging reading I devoured in a few hours! The writing style was riveting! Bailey and Hannah is survival quest, chasing the truth, defining their own dysfunctional step mother-daughter relationship were most powerful elements of the book. And thankfully the story wrapped up satisfyingly.

1233,4.0,"The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura DaveHannah Hall has married Owen, a man that walked into her 'woodturning"" shop and swept her off her feet despite her resistance, due to having just broken up with her fiancée. Owen's sixteen year old daughter, Bailey, despises everything about Hannah but Hannah is determined to win her over someday. Life is good for Hannah, she loves her work, she loves both Owen and Bailey, she finally has a family after suffering for decades over feelings of abandonment because her parents left her when she was young. Then one morning, she kisses Owen as he heads to work and that's the last she sees of him. She gets a note, delivered by a little girl, that says ""protect her"". The FBI arrests his boss and shows up on her doorstep. Bailey's dad has left a HUGE puzzling gift for her in her locker at school. Things are falling apart and what Hannah knows about Owen is no longer adding up. Rather than waiting to see how things unfold, Hannah takes action. Based on a picture and very unreliable memories from when Bailey was less than 4 years old, they are off to a distant city to try to find out Owen's true identity. Is Owen who he says he is and if he's not, what does that mean for Hannah and even more so, for Bailey, his daughter? It's hard to imagine that I would make the choices that Hannah and Bailey make throughout the book but the good thing that comes out of all of this is that they both realize that they have each other through whatever is going on in their lives. What I was drawn to in this story is less the mystery and more the growing relationship between Hannah and Bailey. I think their reliance on each other and Bailey's change as she opens up to Hannah, while she convinces Hannah to be open with her, too, is what makes the story work for me. Their world has become a different, scary place and I enjoyed watching them work through the realization that their lives would never be the same again. Publication: May 4th 2021Thank you to Simon & Schuster and NetGalley for this ARC."

1235,3.0,"A drama/mystery that left me wondering : why all the hype? First of all, I'm really happy for all my GR friends who loved this book. I'm glad I gave it a try after reading your wonderful reviews. I liked the premise, but I thought the execution was a bit simplistic and the main character was bland.On the other hand, I had no problem with the writing and it was a fast read. I wasn't bored, but I wasn't enthralled nor touched either. I definitely felt there was something missing.Many thanks to Netgalley and Simon & Schuster Canada for the ARC!"
1236,2.0,"Less of a thriller and more of a mystery in my opinion. I thought this story started off pretty strong and interesting but I quickly lost interest and became bored with the story and didn't really care what happened to this man. It was quick enough read, but totally forgettable. I finished it a few days ago and I'm already starting to forget the details."
1237,1.0,"I honestly thought this was really bad. The writing was poor and inconsistent, there were tons of grammatical errors, and the story demanded a huge suspension of disbelief. Hannah’s husband Owen disappears amidst a scandal at his job, and he leaves behind a note that simply says “Protect her.” This note refers to his 16 year old daughter, Bailey. Hannah then spends the entire book on a fact finding mission to determine what happened, and uncovers secrets about his past. Secrets that, in my opinion, weren’t all that interesting. Along the way, she is rude and dismissive to multiple people that have the nerve to try and help her.I felt that Hannah shouldn’t have been the main character of the story. Nothing really happens TO her - actually, nothing much happens in the present day at all. The majority of the “action” is Hannah finding out about the past. It may have been more interesting to have some chapters from Owen’s perspective, or even to read the entire story from Bailey’s perspective, as she is more closely tied to the main events.Hannah as the narrator also tended to over explain everything that was going on. It was a lot of “tell, don’t show.” One random example: “His face softens. “No, it’s fine,” he says. “She’s my sister. And it’s just a little sensitive ’cause she’s not with us anymore…”His sister. He said she was his sister. And he said she isn’t with them anymore.” Umm yea... we know he said that, Hannah! We were all there. Hannah also had a tendency to say (as the narrator) “that stops me” after people say something important to her. That stops you from what? She is never actively doing anything when the phrase is used, other than listening to someone else talk. I could go on, but all in all, don’t understand the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this book. It was not for me at all."
1238,5.0,i like mysteries more than thrillers and i'm not afraid to say it
1239,4.0,"ive seen mixed reviews for this one, so i was a little nervous going into it. but i had literally zero expectations, which is probably why i enjoyed it so much.i was immediately hooked from the beginning. i think the pacing is spot on, the flashbacks are effective, the characters are relatable, and the plot is very straightforward. i really, really enjoyed how even though the mystery of the missing husband is at the forefront of the story, the growing bond between hannah and bailey is really worth reading. the only blip would be the general ending - i dont think its very strong and i can understand why many readers are let down by it. its not really a thrilling ending, but suitable, if that makes sense. it fits the overall vibe of the story, so i personally dont mind it. i also loved the epilogue, so that helped me overlook it, as well.overall, i enjoyed this much more than i thought i would and it definitely has me interested in picking up the authors other books!↠ 4 stars"
1240,5.0,"Published Today! (4th May 2021) A suspenseful, addictive and surprisingly emotional mystery about family and loveHannah Hall receives a note from her husband Owen, saying only 'protect her' before he disappears, leaving Hannah to take care of his 16 year old daughter Bailey. What is going on? Where is Owen? Who can Hannah trust? And does she really know her husband?I really enjoyed The Last Thing He Told Me, and flew through the pages, needing to know what would happen to Hannah, Bailey and Owen! I always know I'm enjoying a book when I tell my husband about it, and when I think about it when I'm not reading, which was definitely the case here!I hadn't heard of Laura Dave before I saw a glowing review by my friend Ceecee, but decided to request it, and now I want to read more of this author's work because this hooked me in from the start, and kept me entertained until the end! I loved the writing style, it was really engaging, pulling me in fast, and keeping me on my toes, as I discovered all was not what it seemed.The story was told from Hannah's first person POV in the present tense. Present tense doesn't always work for me, but this one did, perhaps because it also had flashbacks into Hannah's past. It was a character driven story, and really focussed on their relationships. I loved Hannah, she was strong, independent, resourceful and real. I felt for her as she tried to muddle through such a stressful and worrying time, whilst still trying to win over her stepdaughter. Bailey was very well written as a teenager! Their relationship was so well written, and I enjoyed seeing the bond between them blossom. Motherhood comes in many forms, and you could feel Hannah's love for Bailey throughout the story. Owen had disappeared right from the start of the book, but I still felt like I knew him, due to the flashbacks, and from Hannah and Bailey's love for him. I also liked hearing about Hannah's grandfather, and his effect on her life.I've seen that some reviewers didn't like the bittersweet ending, but I cannot see how it could've ended any other way. I was satisfied with it, even though I couldn't see the writing at points because my tears blurred the words! I saw earlier that this is being adapted, which I am pleased about because this would transfer so well to the screen I think!This would be a great book to read to get you out of a slump, or if you want a quick, gripping, character driven story!Many thanks to NetGalley and Serpent's tail/Viper/Profile Books for my ARC, in exchange for an honest review!"
1241,3.0,"Such decent writing. Such a dull, long winded plot.Such an unsatisfying ending for me. This one got me down.I'm rating it a 3.5 out of 5 and reducing it to a 3 because I had just read a hilarious comedy (The Car Share), and was feeling no pain, only to be brought down by this one.Emotional manipulation, a term I'm borrowing from another Goodreads' friend, is not my thing: people will flock to books that make you cry: I'll only read those if there is redemption and a hint of hope to be found. This one just put a big frown on my face, despite the often decent writing style, although the dialogue was sometimes off or just seemed like a time waster/filler.This was not my cup of tea and is the second book by this author that left me feeling emotionally unsatisfied. (A little more effort and a solution could have been found. I thought of a few myself: like cosmetic surgery, for one. You can even alter finger prints these days. Why not be inventive? These saviour complex heroines exhaust me sometimes. Halos are a dime a dozen.)Such a disappointing soap opera!"
1242,3.0," ***NOW AVAILABLE***My first thoughts on this book as I was finishing it were that this was a very slowly paced novel. This is definitely not a thriller as I would define it. I never had that taut, scary feeling that something was going to happen that was terrible, horrible, world changing. There was suspense but it was not that chilling feeling I was expecting. The author definitely has a knack for creating and filling out her characters. Hannah is a woman who loves her husband and can’t believe that he has left them. Bailey is at an age, 16, where she questions everything, except for one thing, HER FATHER LOVES HER!!Hannah is married to Owen, has been for a little over a year. Hannah is a skilled artisan, working with wood to turn out tables, etc. Owen, as far as she knew, was working for a software tech company. They live in a houseboat in the fairly quiet seaside town of Sausalito. (I happen to have visited that area and it is a beautiful place to live). Owen and Bailey had been living here for about a decade.One morning Owen disappears and before Hannah even has time to process what is happening, the TV news tells Hannah that “The Shop”, the name of the company Owen works for, is being investigated for fraud, etc. The head of the company, Avett, has already been arrested and is awaiting trial. The company basically has been selling stock in a company producing a software product that isn’t yet functional!!Things are happening so fast that Hannah is having a hard time deciding what to do. Owen’s daughter, Bailey, is just starting to warm up to the idea that Hannah is her step mother. She lost her mother at a very young age and really has no memory of her. Hannah is drawn to her because she also lost her mother and can understand the pain and confusion.Soon a US Marshall from Texas, Grady, appears at her door, offering to find a way to protect Hannah and Bailey, that is to put them in the Witness Protection Program. Hannah doesn’t think this is what she wants for herself or Bailey. They would have to completely change their lives, their interests, the people that they let into their lives. Hannah doesn’t want this for Bailey, she thinks she can find another way for them to live.Hannah is very resourceful and her friend Jules helps her to dive into the mystery that is Owen. They find out his past and what happened after his first wife died. There is a lot that Owen hasn’t told Hannah. He left her only one note that said “Protect Her” and Hanah knows who he means.The majority of the novel is Hannah looking for the truth, finding it, and making a deal that will affect the rest of her life. Grady, the US Marshall is completely against the idea. “You can’t trust him. It’s crazy for you to think you can. You can not make a deal with the devil and expert it to turn out okay.” I turn away from him, look out the window. “Except I just did”.This book is well written and I did think the characters were interesting and well described. The pace is just what put me off, it seemed to take forever to get to the “good part”. There are many 4 and 5 star reviews out there so my recommendation is to go in blind and see how you feel about it!!I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss.This novel is set to publish on May 4, 2021."
1243,4.0,"The thing is, I like mysteries that aren’t about someone being murdered or sexually assaulted once in awhile. Unraveling the “what happened” thread in a novel doesn’t always have to be tied to figuring out who did the stabbing or the grabbing. In The Last Thing He Told Me, Hannah’s new husband vanishes right after he has a note delivered to her asking that she protect his teenage daughter, Bailey. Here the “what happened” questions are: Where did he go? Protect her from what? Will he come back? Why has a US Marshal shown up on her doorstep if the FBI says that agency isn’t involved? Over the course of the next 300 pages, we follow Hanna as she and her semi-hostile stepdaughter band together to find the answers. I liked their relationship and thought it felt very authentic. I found Hannah’s choices to be fairly reasonable under the extreme circumstances she was facing. I enjoyed the Sausalito, CA and Austin, TX settings. I found the ending to be plausible if not 100% satisfying. Reese Witherspoon picked this as the May 2021 selection for her book club. You should pick it for yours. Ms. Witherspoon is already working on an limited series adaptation for Apple TV that will star Julia Roberts, and you know you want to read the book beforehand.

1244,5.0,"4.5 StarsI haven't been in a reviewing mood lately at ALL, but I wanted to get something down here before I completely forgot...I really enjoyed this one. I enjoyed Dave's writing and I liked how things were slowly revealed to us. I don't want to say too much as I obviously don't want to include spoilers, but I did enjoy how the relationship between Bailey and Hannah transformed over time, especially as revealed at the ending. Which brings me to just that: the ending...I didn't love it. At ALL. But I also wonder if I would have enjoyed the book as much without it. In fact, much of the book's power for me resided in the final ""epilogue"" scene, which wouldn't have been possible without the ending it had. So...definitely a conundrum. Very bittersweet, I guess. Anyway, I'll read more from this author."
1245,5.0,"Hannah is happily married to Owen, and struggling with her relationship with his daughter, Bailey, who is barely civil to her. Hannah’s husband disappears and she finds only a note with two words: “Protect her”. She knows the note refers to her stepdaughter Bailey. But why? And protect her from what? When Hannah receives visits from the FBI and a U.S Marshal, and does some digging herself, she begins to understand that her husband Owen was not who she thought he was. Told in two timelines – one with brief flashbacks to the past, which gives us context and a fuller picture of Hannah and Owen’s life together, and the second is in the present when Hannah and Bailey are forced to work together to find out the truth about Owen. Hannah is smart and intuitive in how she deals with Bailey and their relationship was one of my favorite things about the story. Set in Sausalito and Austin, Texas, Hannah navigates the twists and turns using her intelligence combined with good instincts. She has to reconcile the husband she knows and loves with the new information she receives about him. As the novel progresses, Hannah must figure out what she needs to do to protect Bailey, and make a difficult choice on how to move forward. How she does so was completely unpredictable, yet perfect, which elevated this from a typical mystery/thriller. Many books in this genre disappoint me with the ending, but in this case, I loved it.  So much to love about this one. I loved the relationship between Hannah and Bailey. I loved that the author didn't make Bailey precocious or annoying (as so many teens in fiction). I loved that the ending, the choice she made was completely unpredictable. I loved the epilogue, and I usually hate them. I loved that Hannah was smart and intelligent with good instincts not only in her search for Owen, and making her final decision, but in dealing with a difficult teenager and navigating the stepmother/stepdaughter relationship. My reading buddy, Marialyce, and I both chose this for our BOTM selection last month and we were not disappointed! I read and enjoyed a previous contemporary novel of the author’s but this is a new genre for the author. I hope there are more to come! Recommended for those who love character-driven domestic mysteries that are still strong on plot. If you enjoy smartly written, strong, intelligent women protagonists, you will love Hannah."
1246,4.0,"3.75 rounded up! “PROTECT HER” Owen disappears just as his boss is arrested by the FBI, but before leaving, he has a student deliver to his wife Hannah, a note, which says just those two words. Hannah knows that he is referring to his 16 year old daughter, Bailey, from a previous marriage,but from WHO or WHAT must she protect her from?She thought she knew her husband pretty well, but he was hiding more than a few secrets, and she will need her uncooperative step daughter to help her unravel the clues if she is going to figure out exactly what Owen would want her to do.Laura Dave writes well developed characters and she does real life, messy relationships well! I adored her 2015 novel “Eight Hundred Grapes” 🍇 🍷, which was a 5 ⭐️ love story based in California wine country, so I was eager to read this one, since it involved some suspense!But, this is definitely DOMESTIC SUSPENSE, not a thriller, so expect this to focus on the relationships between the characters as they reveal their true selves, as much as it does the mystery. Hannah is likable, Bailey is 16 through and through, and Owen? How can he leave his daughter when she already lost her mother when she was just a baby? I was fully engaged and interested in finding out, but wanted to feel more angst from Hannah and Bailey as they contemplated their possible future without Owen. Especially toward the end. An epilogue fills you in on what transpires, necessary or it would end without any resolution, and it was touching, but maybe just a little TOO easy? 🎁I would like to thank the Publisher for my gifted copy! It was my pleasure to provide a candid review! Available May 4, 2021"
1247,4.0,"Laura Dave writes a terrifically impressive and moreish suspense novel that shines in its depiction of a moving and growing relationship between Hannah and her 16 year old stepdaughter, Bailey, that develops from a problematic one to a more profound and trusting one. Its evolution begins with the disappearance of Owen Michaels, a man Hannah had been married to for just longer than a year, only for him to suddenly disappear, leaving behind a strange note saying 'protect her' with reference to Bailey. What could have happened to make Owen leave behind his daughter? Bailey, who had lost her mother in an accident when she was a young child, is left a mass of confusion and pain, feelings Hannah can understand and relate to. Matters become darker when the boss of the tech software company Owen worked for is arrested by the FBI for fraud, with the FBI and a US Air Marshall wanting to know more about Owen.Hannah, a skilled craftswoman working in wood, proves to be a resilient, compassionate, courageous, smart, and ferociously determined mother who makes the decision to look into the man she had married as she joins forces with a Bailey that comes to rely on her and begins to trust her. It does not take long before it starts to become apparent that Owen is far from what he appeared to be in this tense narrative that goes back and forth in time, with a focus on Hannah's marriage. There are numerous twists and turns, that involve going from Sausalito, their Californian home, to Austin, Texas, with the truth coming as a shockingly unexpected surprise. This is a riveting, thoughtful, engaging and entertaining read, succinct with short chapters, well plotted and with complex and realistic characters that feel all too authentic. It touches on the nature of family, secrets, deception, danger, and the ties that bind. I understand this is going to be turned into a TV series featuring Julia Roberts! Highly recommended. Many thanks to Serpent's Tail/Profile Books for an ARC."
1248,4.0,"This is a low-key (versus frantic) suspenseful story that kept me turning page after page. I enjoyed the characters and especially the relationship between Hannah and Bailey. Owen and Hannah were married only but a year when he doesn’t return home from work, instead she’s handed a note that says, “Protect her.”This kicks off the mystery about where Owen is, what he’s done and where that leaves Hannah and Bailey, who don’t get along, because Bailey hasn’t taken well to Hannah as a step-mom. Hannah takes us on an adventure, as she determined to find the truth about how both she and Hannah were dumped into this horrible mess. Who really is Owen? Did she really know him at all? Has their marriage been a sham from the beginning? I think you will enjoy finding answers to these questions just as Hannah and Bailey. I enjoyed the ride we get by Hanna’s detective skills, ferreting truth from fiction and how one innocent comment led to a clue and on to the next.I thoroughly enjoyed this read, it’s ups and downs and an ending in which the author didn’t rush or get sloppy with. I’ll definitely be looking at Laura Dave’s other books."
1249,5.0,"The last thing Owen Michaels told his wife Hannah Hall before disappearing is ‘Protect Her’. He must be referring to his sixteen year old daughter Bailey with whom step-mum Hannah has a tricky relationship. After receiving the note Hannah and Bailey’s lives change in ways they could never have foreseen. The story is told by Hannah in the present and with flashbacks from her first meeting Owen which works really well. I couldn’t put this down!! This is how you write a domestic thriller novel! There’s nothing unnecessary, it’s not overlong, the chapters are short, crisp and to the point but the author skilfully creates a real feeling of authenticity. The writing isn’t flashy or over the top, it’s just darned good storytelling I engage with immediately. I love the chapter headings which have a good dose of wit about them. The settings are really good as is the characterisation. Hannah is clever, resourceful, an independent thinker and brave as she’s prepared to do whatever it takes. The portrait of teenager Bailey is very strong, you feel her confused and torn emotions. I like how their relationship changes, develops and morphs as they unite in their attempts to seek out the truth. There are some really good twists and turns in the well paced plot as Hannah pieces together what small snippets of information she has and maximises them. Their anger, confusion and uncertainty of what to believe about Owen comes across well and you admire Hannah’s ingenuity in piecing it together. There’s nail biting suspense as the very unpretty tale emerges which keeps me gripped throughout. The ending is maybe a bit too neatly tied in a bow but that’s not to say I don’t like it - I do!! Overall, I love this book, finding it a well written and very entertaining, enjoyable thriller demonstrating just how far people will go for love. With thanks to NetGalley and Serpents Tail/Viper/Profile Books. I received a free review copy from the publisher in exchange for an honest unedited review."
1250,5.0,"As a stepmother whose husband had full custody of 4 teenage girls, this book immediately grabbed me. It’s been decades, but I still remember that feeling of walking on tenterhooks, trying to develop a relationship with each of them. In fact, at one point, Hannah thinks something I always used to tell myself - pick your battles. So, when her husband Owen goes missing, leaving her a note instructing her to protect her step daughter Bailey, I could totally picture myself in her shoes. I love how these two set out trying to discover exactly what Owen was trying to hide and realizing it goes beyond the financial fraud his company is accused of. It’s a fabulous story - taut, suspenseful. One of the few mysteries that combines in depth character development and a believable plot. (Well, except for one scene when Labrador retrievers are supposed to be guard dogs!). There is a great sense of tension throughout this book. They don’t know who to believe or who to trust. They’re forced to depend more and more on each other. And in the end, the story deals with what it means to be a mother. That it’s not just about blood. To make decisions for a child, not for yourself. This made a great audiobook. Rebecca Lowman did a wonderful job as a narrator. "
1251,4.0," 3.5 A terrible thing has happened to Hannah. Her husband of just over a year, Owen, has run away leaving behind a note that says ""Protect Her"". Owen's boss has been accused by the SEC of fraud and he has been taken by the police. Hannah has been left with her stepdaughter, Bailey, who has never warmed up to Hannah despite multiple attempts to engage her.Hannah can't relate to her new situation. The husband she knows would never leave her or his daughter behind. Something is terribly wrong. Hannah doesn't know much about his past but she knows Owen was married before. His first wife died in an accident and he became a widower with a small baby. Now, Bailey is sixteen and giving her a hard time.A day after his disappearance, a US Marshal stops by her home and tells her, Owen is not the man she thinks he is. Later on, the FBI comes knocking on her door wanting to know where Owen is and how much he knew about what his boss was doing. This pushes Hannah to begin her own investigation and embark on a journey to learn who her husband really is. What she discovers is a trail of lies and deceit.The Last Thing He Told Me was well-written and quite addicting. The pages flew by. I liked Hannah almost instantly. She was trying hard to help Bailey and was ready to do everything to protect her and find the answers they needed. I wasn't happy with the resolution but other than that, I thought the story was a good one.Cliffhanger: No3.5/5 FangsA complimentary copy was provided by Simon & Schuster via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.MrsLeif's Two Fangs About It | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram"

Hannah was an understanding stepmother to Owen’s daughter immediately upon meeting her.Bailey, on the other hand, understandably, was distant, and mis-trusting—not open to a cozy stepmother-stepdaughter connection. Their closeness didn’t come quick or easy, but slowly it developed authentically — with trust, and affinity. Hannah tells us what she knows about Owen:...Twenty-eight years ago, a man walked into her woodturner studio wearing a sports jacket and sneakers. He took her to dinner and the theater.

1253,3.0,"If you are looking for an edge of your seat thriller that gets that heart rate pumping, this might not be the book for you, IMO. That being said this was still a solid read for me. The main characters were realistic, fleshed out and incredibly likable. This was mostly a story about the relationship between a stepmother and stepdaughter, who at the beginning of this novel have a rocky relationship to say the least. The mystery element unfortunately didn't do a whole lot for me, but it was the exquisite writing that kept me reading. The words just seemed to flow so effortlessly that I soon found myself turning the pages rapidly. This is a sign of great writing to me as I've found that if I'm not completely engaged with the story sometimes it seems like a chore to continue reading, but not the case with this book! I did feel like the climax to the mystery was a tad bit disappointing, but the ending wrapped the characters story lines up nicely, and I appreciated the open-ended part (won't say anymore than that!). I would recommend this, however I would recategorize this as a family drama / mystery more so than a suspense / thriller, as to avoid disappointing some fellow thriller fanatics out there."
1254,4.0,"I genuinely enjoyed this book all the way up until the choice she makes at the very end. It's 100% a spoiler, so don't read further if you don't want the ending spoiled. (view spoiler)[So Hannah figures out who her husband really is and what he is running away from. She then decides that her stepdaughter would be safest from unknown criminals if they both no longer have any contact with her husband but they do have some kind of relationship with his previous wife's extended family. The other choice was they all go into witness protection where they all have to hide and uproot their lives, but they do get to stay together. She doesn't even consult the 16 year old daughter on which scenario she would prefer. I personally don't think I would have made that same choice. (hide spoiler)] Also, I will say this isn't a thriller by any means, it's more of a domestic drama/mystery."
1255,2.0,"2*whatever* stars! This is going to be one of those hyped books I found pretty average.It started off really well with a good enough mystery to keep my mind around, but then it slowly started getting downhill with its boring narrative and pretty average plotline and twists. The writing was pretty easy to read which I am most thankful about, otherwise I don't know how the hell I would have completed this in two sitting. And don't even get me started on that ridiculously filmy and cheesy ending. Hannah *my middle name is drama* *whatever is my surname* is one of the most bland character I have ever read about and reading the entire book from her POV, please save me.Bailey *I remember details at crucial times from way back when I was four* is the perfect partner for our narrator who is equally boring. Hannah being the main character wasn't that important all all because she actually isn't the part of the whole mystery. She is just here to ""PROTECT HER"".Overall, I just want it to get over and not think about it ever again."
1256,4.0,"I really connected with this book, I listened to the audiobook and devoured it in a couple of days. Overall, this is a simple tale, but full of meaning and nuance. The basic premise is that Hannah has been married to Owen for just under two years. He has a sixteen-year-old daughter Bailey, and she and Hannah don't really connect. One day out of the blue, a girl comes to the door with a note for Hannah from Owen that says ""protect her"" and Bailey finds a duffel bag filled with money in her locker with a note saying that he has to disappear. The company Owen works for has been raided people arrested. It appears that Owen has fled to avoid prosecution, but the more Hannah discovers, the more she feels that there is more to the story. Owen has been hiding a great deal from everyone.I liked the way this book told the story, both in the present day and giving glimpses into the past. Although Hannah and Bailey venture into armchair detective status, it never gets unrealistic or unbelievable, the things they do are straightforward and probably things that anyone would do in their situation, not knowing who they can trust. I liked the development of Hannah and Bailey's relationship, that too felt incredibly realistic. The ending put the perfect cap onto the story, this isn't a predictable tale, the conclusion is surprising and yet believable. Overall this is a wonderfully told story with just enough mystery to keep the reader invested, and also enough character and relationship development to provide drama and emotion. Highly recommended.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own. "
1257,4.0,"Mother and daughter relationships are often fraught with worry and agitation, but if you can pin another relationship that is assuredly filled with agitation, it might be a step mother to a teenage stepdaughter. And so, we have the story of Hannah, her husband, Owen, and Bailey, the daughter. It’s a shaky relationship, one that Hannah seems smart enough to distance herself from, but then circumstances force the two ladies to become intertwined with one another in ways they had never foreseen.For Owen has gotten in a jam, trouble with a capital T, and the only words he disappears with is “protect her.”As the two surmount obstacles to their being together their main focus is the why of Owen’s disappearance. Yes, the company he worked for is in deep trouble with more federal agencies breathing down their necks, but could Owen ever be the person he is presumed to be?There’s a plethora of things going on as the author weaves a tale of deception, hidden agendas, with the prevailing questions circling around. The importance of Owen’s words become clearer the closer Hannah and Bailey get to the truth.These ladies especially Hannah are smart and perceptive but also are in peril in all they uncover.Will Hannah be able to protect a daughter that is not hers? Will she find the man she loves or will life continue to be a downward spiral into a web of nightmares?Jan and I so enjoyed the time we spent with this story and loved that the author kept us befuddled and in the dark. Definitely recommend this one for its cleverness and plot that had one playing the “whatever happened?” roulette."
1258,4.0,"Nice read. The best part about this one is the authors great skill level, the voice, the characters.This is a Reese Whitherspoon book club choice. I have yet to have a bad read with her books. She always makes excellent choices. Some, of course are better than others. This one is a short read. The way the book is constructed with the extra pages at chapter breaks, the font, spacing, it makes it seem longer. This one is 3.5 stars, rounding up to 4. The story didn’t have enough depth of story and the meager info was meted out a little too slowly. When a well-used premise is utilized I prefer to have a lot more depth in the story design, details and twists coming fast and furious, but that’s just me. This is a great beach read, or an afternoon with a hot cup of tea sitting by the sliding glass door with a view of the world. I do recommend this book."

The Last Thing He Told Me
, asks the question, how well do we really know the people we love?Once again, the one book I didn’t pick as part of my Book of the Month box in May was the one giving me FOMO! I’m so glad I picked this up because it was so good.Hannah never thought she’d get married, and she was fine was that. But then she met Owen and she realized she’d found the man she wanted to spend her life with. And despite his teenage daughter, Bailey, resenting her, their first year of marriage has been a good one.One day she gets a message from Owen that says “Protect her.” Then he disappears, just as the software company he worked for is raided by the FBI. Was he complicit in the things they say his company did? Why did he run? And should she trust the U.S. marshal who seems to know more than he’s saying?As Hannah realizes that Owen isn’t whom he said he was, while there are implications for her and her marriage, there are even greater ones for Bailey. Has her whole life been a lie? Together they try to figure out the truth, unaware of just what that will mean for them.“That’s how you fill in the blanks—with stories and memories from the people who love you. If they lie to you, like he did, who are you then? Who is he?”
The Last Thing He Told Me
 is part-mystery, part-thriller, but it’s also an introspective story, a look at love and relationships and truth and doing everything for those you love. The pacing is slow at times and fast at others, but I was totally hooked on the story.I know it’s been optioned for a television movie and that totally makes sense.

1260,3.0,"I dunno......I'm going to be honest here as I stand in a lonely field by myself and hear the crickets chirping. This book has received some mighty high reviews and I honor that. But it didn't ring as many bells for me.The Last Thing He Told Me circles around Hannah Hall whose husband, Owen, is missing. Slam the door and gone. No warnings, no hints, no routine out of the usual. He just doesn't return home one day leaving his sixteen year old daughter, Bailey, in Hannah's care. There is a note later delivered by a young girl with only two words: Protect her. And most definitely Hannah will.I was taken with the beginnings of this book as the voice of Hannah describes her initial relationship with the missing Owen. It had substance and a believability factor going for it in the first half. As the weight of the impact hits Hannah, we feel her frustrations and fear. But what landed with a thud were the outrageous ""clues"" pieced together from nuggets forced out of nowhere and the sudden memories that Bailey had from her toddler years. I most certainly wanted to get onboard. The ""paydirt"" came so late and the unwinding took forever. That's just me. Take it out for a spin and see what you think. It's still an enjoyable read."
1261,3.0,"This was more a domestic mystery than suspense it was a very slow burn which I couldn’t get into , I found the characters flawed to the hilt & not much going on in the first half Owen leaves a note for Hannah PROTECT HER! Hannah knew what he meantBailey Owens daughter, who dislikes Hannah vehemently even though zHannah tries everything she can to win her over. Then Hannah finds a duffel bag in her locker at school left by Owen she shows Hannah when she is picked up at school they find millions of dollars wrapped up ,Hannah can’t believe what she is seeing.When Avery Johnson the CEO of The Stop an software company is arrested for fraud & embezzlement it becomes apparent that Owen was involved somehow .What is the reason Owen disappeared? Is he a victim or was he set up? This was a very slow burn it was good at the beginning but by the end I found some aspects of the prose implausible 3 ✨ "
1262,1.0,"1.5 starsOof. I haven't read one this bad in a while. Reese Witherspoon lost my trust a long time ago, but wowza she needs to fire whoever is on her pickin' committee. I'm truly baffled by the hype for this book. Hannah, a character with about as much zip as a saltine cracker, finds a note from her husband Owen that simply says, ""Protect her."" (Don't worry you don't have to remember that line because the author repeats it 304930 times.) Puzzled, our vanilla bean protagonist does not understand why her husband no longer answers her calls and seems to have abandoned her and his 16-year-old daughter Bailey (Hannah's stepdaughter). Soon, Bailey finds an obscene amount of money stuffed into her locker at school and the company Owen worked for is under FBI investigation. Hannah has no clue what's happening but decides to gallivant off to Austin (off a random hunch) with Bailey in search of clues. From there, the pair stumble along into who Owen used to be and why he chose to jump ship. The pacing of this story was bad enough--slower than a man taking a dump. But there was absolutely zero pizazz, no mystery, no intrigue. We're told Hannah and Bailey--the dullest duo in fiction--are in a lot of danger, but we never are truly shown. And after all the traipsing around Austin to get to know the ""real"" Owen... it still doesn't make sense to me why Owen he had to leave. Essentially, this could have been communicated with an email, and I don't see how Hannah handled this all so well... but again, no personality so how could she?Also, can we all agree that titled chapters (with the exception of dates/character names) are extremely juvenile? The Last Thing I'll Tell You, skip this one."
1263,4.0,"4.0 stars—“The Last Thing He Told Me” by Laura Dave is the first book I have ever read by Ms Dave— as I believe this is her first thriller. Ms. Dave is a very accomplished writer, and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. The book is written from the perspective of Hannah, who recently married Owen, and became a stepmother to his daughter, Bailey. The story begins with Hannah receiving a hand written note from Owen to “Protect her.” (obviously referring to his daughter Bailey). The book then begins unfolding the mystery of the disappearance of Owen and how Hannah proceeds to investigate the reason for his disappearance and whereabouts. The author does a good job at keeping the pace of the book moving, and the mystery of Owen’s disappearance ongoing throughout the book. It reminded me of a better novel by Harlan Coben for the majority of the book. Only the convoluted and predictable ending that has been done (better) numerous times before keeps this book from getting a higher rating. All in all a good book from an author I definitely want to read again."
1264,4.0,"This is a really well written, highly enjoyable, mystery book! It kept me up late at night turning pages. When I wasn’t reading it, I was wondering what the heck was going on with the man characters. I can see why this is a book club favorite!Hannah lives a normal life with her husband (Owen) and teenage stepdaughter (Bailey). Her normal life goes out the window when she receives a note that says “protect her”. The note is from her husband who is on the run because the company he works for is under investigation. Owen has left Hannah to care for Bailey. Will the pair be able to figure out where her father has gone and why?"

1267,4.0,"""Protect her"" were the last words Owen Michaels ever told his wife Hannah. Written on a scrap of paper delivered to her door by a young school girl on the day he disappeared. Hannah doesn't know why he's run away, but the boss of the software company he works at has just been arrested for fraud, so could Owen be mixed up in corporate crime as well?Married to Owen for only a year, Hannah knows exactly who Owen means in his note - his sixteen year old daughter Bailey, now Hannah's moody teenage step-daughter. Bailey's mother, Owen's first wife, died when she was young and he has always tried to put her first and be the best father he can. Hannah wants to find him desperately, as do the FBI and a US Marshal from Texas, which Hannah finds strange since they live in Sausilito. And then her lawyer calls to tell her that Owen might not be the man she thought he was. The mystery unravels gradually as Hannah and Bailey set out on a quest to discover who Owen really is and what he's been hiding from them, setting in motion revelations that will change all their lives. Hannah is a strong and resourceful character with a resilience that Bailey comes to admire, gradually drawing the two of them together into a closer family unit. The well written, interesting plot with a light touch of suspense keeps the reader guessing making for a fast, addictive read.With thanks to Serpent's Tail and Netgalley for a copy to read"
1268,3.0,"Having a “Bookstagram” account has been so much fun for me. All books, all the time and very little drama llama B.S. But then there’s the dark underbelly no one talks about . . . . 

Yes, my friends, the FOMO, she is real. And me????? Well . . . . . 

My debilitating condition is not helped by things like Reese’s Book Club or Read With Jenna or Book of the Month either. Much like Pokemon, I gotta catch read ‘em all! And sometimes they aren’t winners. Don’t get me wrong, the pages turned quickly enough on this one, but the premise (and I’m going to try my best to not present any spoilsies) that a husband leaves his life, his wife, his daughter and only a note to “Protect Her” was maybe just a weeeeeeee too Lifetime Television for Women for me. As the story developed, it became even more farfetched that this particular gentleman would have even put himself in such a potentially high-profile position he did to begin with and, well . . . . 

That cover tho . . . . I actually just got scolded (lightheartedly) by one of my real-life friends for being such an easy sell when it comes to house covers. My defense???? But this had a houseBOAT on the cover. And then I promptly read How Lucky which also had a house on the cover and requested The Perfect Family on NetGalley because it had a house on the cover. It’s a sickness.Everyone else seems to really love this one. I’ll gladly take the wrongreader title with my mediocre rating."
1269,3.0,"I was intrigued by the premise of the story and the hype for this book. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work for me 😏.Hannah and Bailey play detective as they go in search for answers. They need to find Owen, who suddenly disappeared and left them nothing but a note and money. It's a race to find answers before getting caught! All while having to figure out who they can and cannot trust. Seems interesting, right?Unfortunately, the delivery fell flat. This is pretty much a long-winded and somewhat unrealistic story. If not for the short chapters, I would've probably given up on this one. For me, this was the opposite of an unputdownable book; it took me twenty days to read this one 😬."
1270,3.0,"The Last Thing devoted husband and father, Owen said in a note before he disappeared to his wife, Hannah was Protect her. Does Hannah protect her? This is the most interesting part of the story. It’s a fresh take on that “stepmother” trope and the story centres around the relationship between Hannah and Bailey as they track down the truth as to why Owen disappeared. The Last Thing He Told Me is a solid, slow-building mystery that explores secrets, lies, love, trust, and faith in a marriage. It explores the dynamics between stepmother and child, and that is the driving force of the story. I loved the relationship between Hannah and Owen’s daughter Bailey and the bond they developed. The story exams the character’s motivations, and their development results from the bond that is developed. ALL the characters are likeable from start to finish.We learn the mystery of Owen’s disappearance through Hannah as she does. We see her past dynamics with Owen as her narrative alternates from past and present. We learn of her early days with Owen alongside with her current hunt for him. The pacing is slow and never really picked up for me, even with the twists and climax of the story. The suspense is light, and the danger is moderate. The stakes are not high until Hannah learns the truth, and even then, there was not enough tension to keep this dark and twisted reader on the edge of my chair, gripping my kindle. Even through this one was not the best for me, I do consider it one of the better reads and I recommend for reader who enjoy likeable characters and a good easy, entertaining solid lighter mystery that you go along for the ride rather than the thrill.I received a copy form the publisher through NetGalley."
1271,2.0,2.5 don’t understand the hype? Overall I found the story pretty dull
1272,5.0,"Check out my 1 minute spoiler free video review here: https://youtu.be/d9P7Ky3XDIEThe book features a newly married Hannah who discovers that her husband, Owen Michaels, has disappeared. He leaves her a note, “Protect her.” What could it mean? One thing. His daughter, Bailey. Bailey, the 16 year old, who is high on attitude and likes her stepmother as much as the typical 16 year old. What happened to Owen? How will things turn out for Bailey and Hannah? Clear your schedule because you will need to read this book non-stop! It wasn’t boring at all – this book was definitely thrilling! The book would focus on the present and then would cut to a flashback where Hannah is trying to comb through her memories looking for clues. This give the book such a realistic feel as when something goes wrong you try to think back on could you see this coming, what did you miss? The particular manner in which this book was written, it always felt as if you were going to make a big discovery eminently and would learn a little more, a little more along the way. The ending was also unexpected!It has been a long time since I read a thriller this good! Enjoy!*Thank you, NetGalley, for the free copy of this book in exchange for my fair and honest opinion!"
1273,4.0,"“The Last Thing He Told Me” by Laura Dave is a satisfying domestic thriller of a novel. It revolves around Hannah, a woman who married (a year ago) a widower with a teenage daughter. Hannah was raised by her grandfather after her own mother left her. Hannah is no stranger to the issues of an abandoned child. She marries Owen Michaels, a charming and incredibly intelligent coder for a tech firm in northern California. Owen has a daughter, Bailey, who isn’t pleased about her father’s marriage. Bailey lost her mother when she was four and has little memory of her mother. Bailey and Own have been on their own for a decade so teenage Bailey treats Hannah as an interloper.The story opens with an unknown twelve-year-old girl giving Hannah a message on a piece of yellow legal paper. The message is short and from Owen. “Protect Her” is all it says. Hannah is confused, and all her calls to Owen go unanswered. Life becomes stranger when Hannah retrieves Bailey from school, and Bailey has a duffle full of money that Owen left in her locker.Owen vanishes after the company he worked for becomes under SEC investigation for fraud. To add to Hannah’s stress, she gets visits from the Feds. Hannah soon realizes that Owen has some secrets; in fact, most of what he told her are lies. As Hannah and Bailey do their own sleuthing to figure out who and what Owen is hiding from, we get the back story of Hannah’s life before Owen and her romance with Owen. This is a perfectly paced thriller that keeps the reader involved. Beyond the thriller part, Dave works in Hannah’s observations of her life and her marriage with Owen. Dave writes Hannah as a strong woman, not just one who seemed to be duped. For example, once she comes to terms with the fact that Owen isn’t who she thought he was, her inner musing:“Owen isn’t who I thought he was, at least in the details. There are parts I wish didn’t exist, parts I can’t look away from now. In one way or another, this is the deal we all sign when we love someone….It’s the deal we all sign again and again to keep that love. We don’t turn away from the parts of someone we don’t want to see.”I found Hannah’s thoughts kept me involved. I’m not a fan of stupid female characters who are duped because they are desperate or needy. Hannah reflected much on her marriage with Owen and what she should have known. Dave knows teen girls, as Bailey is written perfectly with her snarky comments one minute and neediness the next.I enjoyed the story and the pacing. The flaw I found is the sleuthing that Hannah and Bailey did. Hannah negotiates their way out of suspicious situations which I found implausible. Thrillers generally need to have an unrealistic bent, so I forgive Dave. Julia Roberts and Reese Witherspoon intend to turn the story into a TV series. I always prefer to read the novel before I see the Hollywood rendition. "
1274,3.0,"3.5 StarsWhat I enjoyed:• I enjoyed part 1 as the book dived straight into it so I was hooked and interested from the get go. • The characters were likeable and realistic, especially Hannah. I enjoyed the story from her point of view because I was able to connect with her. She's a normal person in an unlikely situation and was so out of her depth. Her thoughts, reactions and actions felt realistic and she didn’t do anything that was so far-fetched or crazy. • The relationship development between Hannah and her step daughter Bailey was wholesome. At the start, Bailey was an annoying and bratty teenager, however I enjoyed how they began to lean on and support each other. And in the end Bailey called her mum. What I didn't enjoy:• After part 1 I felt pretty neutral for the rest of the book. The investigation was boring, it felt like they were trying to find a needle in a haystack. The discoveries felt so forced because they were so random, grasping at the distant past hoping to spark memories and recalling everyday conversations.• There was no real tension or urgency to find Owen. For example, there was no indication that anyone was in immediate trouble, the detectives made an appearance at the start only and were nonexistent for the rest so they didn’t add more pressure. Essentially nothing felt time critical.• The reveal about Owen’s true past was anticlimactic as there was no mystery built around it. There were little to no clues so it could have been anything and I would have felt the same - Neutral rather than surprised.Not what I expected:• The genre. This is not so much a thriller or suspense but more of a slow paced domestic mystery. I was never at the edge of my seat and after part 1 I wasn’t dying to know what happens next.The dual timeline focused more on the relationships and didn’t build up any mystery. I was expecting to see more bread crumbs and clues. Eyebrow raising moments:(view spoiler)[• Tobias Cookman talked about why Owen was the worst student he had ever had and I found it hilarious and ridiculous when he said that Owen had been failing because of a popular girl in class. I thought WHAT?! When I look back at my own university days, I would be surprised if professors could name all the students in their class, let alone know who was popular with the boys? Owen had also told/emailed him that he was failing because he was in love. I just thought...wow...there was a time in my life where I almost failed all 4 subjects (P’s get degrees haha), maybe I should’ve emailed my professors my life problems and seen if they’d have any sympathy for me. I can’t imagine any student doing that! I felt that they had a student - teacher relationship so I found this whole part really weird. • If Grady wanted to get Hannah and Bailey into witness protection why couldn't he have told Hannah the truth from the start? • The vague notes left behind. Surely he had an extra 1 minute to write a bit more. • When Hannah hung up on Evelyn. I found that extremely rude considering she had bent the rules to help them lol! Talk about being used and thrown away! (hide spoiler)]You will like this if: You love stories that are more focused on family drama and relationships rather than the thrills or mystery build up.Review Website | Bookstagram"

1276,5.0,"Hannah Hall gets the surprise of her life when her husband Owen, disappears and leaves a note saying “protect her”. Left with nothing but questions and the stepdaughter who still hasn’t warmed up to her, Hannah tries to figure out what happened to Owen and why. But the more she searches, the more she uncovers and Hannah may have just put her and her stepdaughter right in the path of danger.I did not expect to love this book so much when I picked it up. It’s been very popular at the library where I work and I had heard lots of buzz about it. Imagine my surprise when my audiobook hold came in and I just couldn’t stop listening. This book was so compelling!! First with where the husband went, then the whys, and then even more layers added to the situation. The thing that really got me about this book was the relationship between Hannah and Bailey. I don’t think people realize how special a person it takes to love and raise a child that isn’t biologically theirs, do do anything, be everything for that child. There’s lots of stories about evil stepparents, but I have had the privilege of a stepparent that raised me as their own and I know remarkable it is. So I really connected with this book on that particular level because I saw myself and my parents in this story. This book gets five stars because at the end of it I actually was tearing up while listening."
1277,5.0,"Protect herThat was the last communication Hannah received from her husband, Owen, before he disappeared. The note was delivered by a 12 year old stranger. Hannah knew that Bailey, Owen's 16 year old daughter, was the person she was supposed to protect. But how? From what? Told in present day, with periodic flashbacks, we follow Hannah and Bailey on their quest to find the truth. As secrets are uncovered, Hannah questions if she really knew Owen at all.This is a gripping story from the beginning and it never let's up. The pages fly by until the very end. I didn't want to put it down. I found this to be a thrilling mystery as well as an emotional story. I enjoyed the relationship between Hannah and her step daughter. I can't wait to read more by Laura Dave! Thank you Simon & Schuster and NetGalley for this ARC in exchange for an honest review."

1279,3.0,"This was such a fast read with a bittersweet ending that could’ve been a little bit strong? Idk I just didn’t like how the book ended. After all of that, I expected something stronger and more impactful? I also would’ve loved to see some character development.

1280,4.0,"Domestic suspense when done well makes for a page turning read while providing insights into the characters and their relationships. While the plot revolves around a missing husband, it is the women and their relationship that is portrayed in all of its frustrating and budding glory. Even when the mystery goes into familiar territory, Dave has a few new twists, some difficult choices and doesn’t shy away from an ending that is not storybook. The final word brought me to tears, how many novels of suspense can say that?Laura Dave excelled in this one and in a new genre at that. There are so many great reviews for this book, I can’t add more to the discussion. This was a gripping tale that left me with the ultimate question, what would I do?"

1282,2.0,"Rating: 2.whatever / 5Okay, so maybe this is my patience wearing extremely thin or maybe I'm just not into these novels anymore as much as I was last year and the year before that, but...if I don't effing care what happens to the protagonist of these mystery-thrillers, then I won't have enough motivation to continue reading.I hope it's as simple as that to understand, really.Hannah whatshername is about as bland as a piece of unsalted-buttered bread, and her motivation is...mixed up in a narrative of her poor ""won't let anyone get close to her, won't let anyone in because of a tragic backstory because these books can't have a normal person be the protagonist blah blah blah"" internal drama. It's just...something I've seen done before and something I've been done BETTER before, so why should I bother with this story?I was kind of interested in the whole defrauding company plotline with the husband, especially based on what's going on with the stock market now in 2021, but...yeah, having to follow it through Hannah's first person P.O.V. just made me roll my eyes and slog through each page slowly as heck. Like...snail speed and even then I still DNFed it and gave up, Netgalley freebie be darned!Maybe for someone who cares only about the plot and not about the protagonist, this is a recommended read. Maybe. Myself, I'm far too pick not to care about all of the above, therefore a DNF is well-deserved from my point of view if it's on my shelves.One word to end off on this review: N-E-X-T!"
1283,4.0,"⭐️4 Stars⭐️How popular is The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave right now! Loved the mystery/suspense components of this intriguing read, it was a page turner for me! Hannah, Owen and Bailey live happily on a houseboat in Sausalito, Northern California. Hannah is a successful woodturner and creates handcrafted furniture. She's been married to Owen for a little over a year. Owen works for a lucrative software technology firm called The Shop.Sixteen year old Bailey is not overly thrilled with her stepmother but Hannah is determined to win her over.Hannah is delivered a couriered note on the day her husband disappears that reads ‘protect her’ which can only mean one thing, to protect his daughter. The Shop has been raided by the FBI and the CEO of Owen’s company has been held in custody with expected charges of embezzlement and fraud. Hannah doesn’t believe Owen would be involved in fraud so together with Bailey they set out to discover the truth and search for 'missing' Owen. What they shockingly discover is that Owen is hiding who he really is.The relationship that evolves during this time between Hannah and her step-daughter Bailey is unexpected and forms an intricate part of the story. I really enjoyed the suspense, character development and stepmother/daughter relationship.Publication Date 4 May 2021"
1284,2.0,"2.5 starsDo you ever read a book that everyone and their mother seems to be raving about and you just think... did I read the same book?! Whelp, this was the case with The Last Thing He Told Me. I initially gave it 3 stars, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that this was worse that okay for me (3 stars is my standard rating for an ""okay"" read).So, why didn't I like it.... first, THIS IS NOT A THRILLER! This is a slow-burn domestic drama/ mystery. Which is okay, but I was definitely expecting a more pulse-pounding page turner. The book started out fine, but started going downhill once we find out the general reason for Owen being missing. Things became WAY to convoluted for me. A lot of the mystery unfolded based on Bailey remembering VERY specific things from when she was FOUR years old. I don't always mind super unbelievable plot points if the book is entertaining, but this was not the case here. I have seen a lot of reviews saying how much they loved Hannah's character - to me, she was a decent character, but very boring - I didn't get a lot of depth from her. I also hated the ending.I did really enjoy the settings of Sausalito, California (the house boats were cool!), and Austin, Texas. I also liked seeing Hannah and Bailey's relationship develop. Unfortunately, I think this author is just not for me. This was the fourth book of hers that I've read, and the only one I liked was Eight Hundred Grapes (I decided to give this one a chance because of rave reviews and the fact that it was labeled as a thriller). Please take my review with a grain of salt, as everyone else seems to be loving it!Thank you to Goodreads and Simon & Schuster for the ARC!"
1285,4.0,"4.5This was a surprise and a good one! I've been reading a string of mystery's on my iPad lately and it was nice to still be reading a mystery, but not have it be so dark. The pace was quick, but never flashy or gaudy and there were plenty of twists that were believeable and well executed. This was my first Laura Dave book and I will definitely look into her future work. I'm also excited to see how the Julia Roberts/Apple TV adaption turns out. I think this will translate to a limited series well.

1286,4.0,"This domestic suspense will have you on a mission to discover what the real story is behind Owen Michaels. When he disappears, leaving behind his 16 year old daughter, Bailey and his wife, Hannah, it is a race for time to find out what is going on. The only revelation he was alive when he dropped $60,000 off with his daughter and a note ""protect her"". Bailey lost her mother when she was a toddler, so this is too much to cope with losing her dad also. When the U.S. Marshall and FBI agents interrogate Hannah, she realizes her husband is in a conspiracy of fraud with his company. Hannah and Bailey set out to investigate who he really is when they realize he doesn't exist under that name.

I am excited to hear that Reese Witherspoon’s company Hello Sunshine is making a series out of it starring Julia Roberts. I for one will be tuning in.The Last Thing He Told Me is an intense page turner that you won’t want to stop reading. It is a wild ride following Hannah and her step daughter Bailey after Owen, the husband and father of these women, ups and disappears. The company that he has been working for is raided by the FBI and he is nowhere to be found. As they put the pieces of the puzzle together , Hannah and Bailey realise that they didn’t know Owen at all.Thanks to Serpents Tail, Viper Books and NetGalley for my advanced copy of this book to read.

1288,1.0,"Not a thriller but a slow-paced mystery with far too many words—very wordy. I found the characters bland and the plot dull. I kept reading, hoping for more to happen. Not the book for me.

1289,3.0,"3.5 stars.Alright... all that hype for something that is not that remarkable but good enough for a TV deal.But I have to confess that I did enjoy the writing and the structure.I was, in fact, very engaged and I felt entertained. If that was the author’s main intention then, in my opinion, I think that she did a good job.Regardless, the development is not very thrilling but it is at the same time, far from boring.Now, about the storyline, it’s been done before. There is nothing new or outstanding. And the ending was too abrupt and unsatisfying (to me).I heard that this work is going to be adapted for the TV, having Julia Roberts as the protagonist (Julia Roberts and Reese Whiterspoon are two of the producers).Some authors (Ruth Ware, as a quick example) are so lucky."
1290,4.0,"3.75 starsthis one was rather emotional for a thriller. the mystery was answered, but i dont think the case was exactly solved. the ending was cliffhanger-ish or loose/vague and bittersweet. i was hoping for more of a romantic one that was leaning toward a HEA for the family, but that would probably not fit the genre lol. the writing was engaging, and its been a while since i read domestic suspense that had me on the edge of my seat. would recommend this! also, i heard that its being adapted, so thats awesome. :D

❝Protect her.❞

The Last Thing He Told Me was a truly riveting read! I read it in only one day, and I very rarely read books that quickly these days. I just couldn’t stop reading it, I was absolutely hooked!!This book single-handendly got me out of my Crooked Kingdom book hangover, so for that alone it deserves four stars tbh :’)The Last Thing He Told Me is a testament to the power of family. The things we do for the ones we love — the lengths we go for their happiness and safety, and the things we must sacrifice along the way. Some people will do anything for love, or in the name of love.
❝It’s a terrible thing to know everything about someone long after you want to.❞
I really liked the book’s ending! It surprised me, and it wasn’t cliche at all. It was a quite a bittersweet ending… (view spoiler)[Like I’m happy for Hannah and Bailey, and their flourishing mother-daughter relationship. But I’m also sad for Hannah and Owen, and at the fact that they will never be able to be together again... (hide spoiler)]

This was a really good mystery novel. This is my first Laura Dave book, and it didn’t let me down so I might read more of her books in the future!____________________ARC provided by the publisher via NetGalley."
1292,1.0,"I enjoyed reading the 2 star and below reviews more than I enjoyed the actual book. At least I’m not alone in my reaction to this faulty plot. Hannah’s characterization made NO sense. She starts off as this flighty, artsy, successful wood maker who daintily loses her parking ticket on her first date with Owen. Then she (mind you with no progression), grows into super mom and detective of the year. She also seemed to drop her career along the way. Lots of random side plots and characters with unanswered questions. Don’t care to know the answers. Just a really bad read. "
1293,3.0,"I had been in a bit of a reading slump until suddenly I read one of Reese Witherspoon's book club picks. Then I wanted to read all the things. The thing is that one book was a hit and so far I've read two others that have been kinda misses.

Am I done with her? Nope I'm on a roll here and I'm sticking with it.Anyways this book. I'm going to try and not spoil anything because the book is extremely readable and most everyone is really loving it. Hannah gets a note from her husband Owen that just says ""protect her"" and automatically knows he is speaking of his daughter Bailey. Then Hannah finds out that Owen and even Bailey are not who she thought they were.They have the US Marshalls wanting to talk to them. The FBI. The people that her husband supposedly double crossed. It's a tad bit stressful.The whole time Hannah is trying to find her way with a sixteen year old stepdaughter.

Like I mentioned, the book is extremely readable but kinda blah when I finished it and thought about it. I'm sticking with the whole middle ground of three stars.Booksource: Library"
1294,4.0,"A riveting mystery about a missing manHannah and Owen have not been married very long before he disappears without a trace. He leaves behind a brief note stating, ""Protect her."" Hannah knows the note refers to Owen's sixteen-year-old daughter, Bailey. Bailey lost her mother as a child, and Owen is all she has. Meanwhile, the company Owen works for is caught up in a swirl of scandal, while the FBI and U.S. Marshals show up on Hannah's doorstep. The more Hannah investigates, the more she realizes that Owen must have been hiding secrets about his past. And those secrets may be putting her and Bailey in grave danger. 
""Owen's note is short. One line, its own puzzle. Protect her.""
This was an excellent page-turner: a wonderful character-driven mystery that sucked me in from the very beginning. It keeps you wondering and guessing from the start. Why did Owen disappear? Is he a good guy or a bad one? We discover things as Hannah does, and the book is so engrossing. She and Bailey unravel Owen's past, becoming detectives themselves, and we get snippets from the past they do.It's fascinating trying to piece everything together. I was frantically flipping the pages, and I read this one in only a couple of settings. The language is flowery but absorbing. In addition to the key disappearance, Dave reflects on Hannah's relationships with both Owen and Bailey. If you want to get lost in a good mystery for a couple of days (or hours), I highly recommend this one. Blog ~ Twitter ~ Facebook ~ Instagram ~  PaperBackSwap ~ Smashbomb "
1295,4.0,"3.5 stars rounded up! This was a good classic mystery novel. This was not a super suspenseful thriller, keep you on the edge of your seat book. The storyline unfolds more slowly taking some time to get to the plot. It has a lot of family drama added in. I enjoyed it with the exception of a couple parts that were too slow for me. The ending was very bittersweet and I found myself wishing for a different ending. It was an anti-climatic ending and I guess I was just hoping for a bit better of an ending. Overall, a good read and I would recommend. Thank you Simon & Schuster and Net Galley for the ARC in return for my honest review. "
1296,4.0,"3.75 ✭✭✭✭Reese Witherspoon has good taste when it comes to picking women's fiction for her book club, a genre that can leave me a bit unenthusiastic.This was an engaging suspense/mystery that I quite enjoyed about a smart wife and step-mom who has some challenging decisions to make and actions to take following the sudden disappearance of her husband.

I was 　 　 　scared that the wrong person would stay. ❞4.9/5 :)WOW… This book really stood out to me and made its way into my heart... Must I say more?It all started with a strong, solid and tempting prologue that invites you to keep reading. This was told in first person POV from Hannah's perspective. The story was split into three different parts and was easy to follow. It switched between the past and present as they piece together the truth about everything.The characters were likable and dynamic. Their flaws are what make them good and realistic characters. I especially loved seeing how Bailey slowly warms up to Hannah. The details and little gestures make me really happy (happy as a reader and happy for them.) Bailey's whole personality -including flaws because nobody is perfect- is wonderful. She developed so much by the end of the story, making me like her character even more.This book reminds me of how long it's been since I've read a book with actual chapter names. (Not that numbers are bad or anything.) Anyways, I love the chapter titles.There were some minor details that I was confused about, but that didn't affect the plot much. (view spoiler)[For example, what happened to the bag of money? What was in the piggy bank? Was that the end of The Shop? How are Carl and Patty? (hide spoiler)]The last chapter makes me mad that it ended like that, but I still love it. It's a happy ending, yet it isn't a happy ending… that makes sense, right? The ending keeps you wondering yet isn't too vague that it feels like no thought was put into it. This is the type of ending that I'd like to see in future books.I've got to say, this is my type of book, and it definitely cured my reading slump :)03/01/21*apparently, this is going to be adapted into a film?? 😯 i'm excited about it, yet i'm scared it'll ruin the story…━━━━━━━━━━━༻༻❁༺༺━━━━━━━━━━━ SAME NAME AUTHOR LET'S GOOOI GOT AN ARC! ºoºfinally wasn't rejected~"

1299,3.0,"3.5*Didn't love the ending, not because it was bittersweet - my 🖤 was completely fine with that 😅 I would just have liked one more chapter with some time jumps to see first encounters and/or relationships develop. Bailey was quite brat'ish for most of the read so would've liked to see her character development continue some bit...might make me greedy tho as not really the point of the story but just think it could've been a better more rounded ending as I lowkey wanted to see if she'd square up to N like she does Hannah 😈In saying that the epilogue was 💔 in the best way! But 🤐I liked the familial message tho especially the nuggets of info we get of Hannah + her grandads relationship 🤩 & I did enjoy seeing her relationship with Bailey change - but I deffo think we were only at the tip of the iceberg there. I would have loved to have seen more!I guessed part of the reason for Owen's disappearance but seeing the rest of the puzzle pieces fall into place was an interesting breadcrumb chase and the encounters along the way included some fun interactions - Jake's contributions made me laugh altho they prob weren't supposed to and of course I enjoyed everyone we met in Austen 😄Quick almost one day read, I only managed one chapter (I think) on Friday and devoured the rest yesterday. Perfect story for a rainy afternoon imagining their life on a houseboat in San Francisco...I honestly had no idea there could be an almost village type set up! How limited my imagination & life experiences have been 🤗Massive thanks as always to preoccupiedbybooks for her fab review putting this book on my radar. I might have to copy @Kim and make a variation of her ""Fran made me do it"" Shelf 🙃"
1300,1.0,"I'm really in the minority here and I don't quite get how this book is getting such good reviews. I have it at a 1 - maybe I could possibly go up to a 1.5. Now maybe, part of that rating is in part because the book I read prior was a book of literary fiction that I absolutely loved and found incredibly well written and well crafted and as such it made the inadequacies of The Last Thing He Told Me all the more glaring. Let's start with the characters - they weren't unlike-able, they weren't like-able, they were just bland and not quite fully formed. Then the plot - ugh. I get that in a book of this genre, you have to suspend disbelief, but the writing here was not interesting enough or clever enough to do so. Our main character Hannah, who is trying to track down her missing husband, sees a look come across his best friend's face when she mentions TX - a light bulb goes off and she travels there and in the course of a day and half of very lucky sleuthing she sweet talks several characters (including one with mob ties) into spilling the tea that can solve the mystery. All a bit too convenient, in part because it felt like I was reading the outline for the book instead of a real book. And how many times did someone say 'if you only knew what your husband did' - only to never to reveal what those things were. Was the husband a good guy?, a bad guy? somewhere in between? Who knows, because you never got to know him "
1301,5.0,"May BOTM selection ** 4.5 stars, rounding up.This will have polarizing results with some lauding this as gripping, fast-paced, a real page-turner, etc. While others will label it slow. In fairness, they're all accurate. If the domestic suspense piece of the story doesn't hook you, then all the relationship building will likely miss its mark. If you are a stepparent or have ever been in a serious relationship with someone who has children, you'll enjoy how the author nails the emotions.Laura Dave does an excellent job here balancing mystery and character development. The story centers around the relationship between a stepmom and a defiant 16-year-old as they struggle to piece together why the latter's father abruptly disappeared, leaving behind only a note that says PROTECT HER.By pure definition, this could fall under thriller or suspense. But I agree with other reviewers that it's more suspense than the advertised thriller. I work in the finance industry and love that this was inspired by the Enron scandal. I also read that this has already been optioned for a TV series for a deal in the 7 figure range and the lead will be played by none other than Julia Roberts. Big score for Laura Dave! Cheers!"
1302,4.0,"The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave was a fast paced, twisty and gripping mystery thriller. I listened to the audiobook that was masterfully narrated Rebecca Lowman. The plot was well paced and the characters were well developed, complex and quite believable. In addition, the female characters in this book were both strong and determined which are characteristics I admire. The Last Thing He Told Me explored and even questioned the concepts of family, trust, marriage, sacrifices, devotion, forgiveness, and the roles of stepmothers and second wives. Laura Dave wove a suspenseful mystery that grabbed me from the very beginning. It was difficult to stop listening to this audiobook.How well does anyone really know the person they are married to? After a year of marriage, Hannah Hall, was about to find out how well she really knew her husband, Owen Michaels, after he mysteriously disappeared. One night, Owen, just did not come home from work. Owen had worked as an engineer for a software startup when the company was charged with securities fraud. Trying not to panic or jump to conclusions, Hannah tried endlessly to reach Owen on his cell phone with no success. Hannah discovered a note that Owen had left. There were only two words on the note, “Protect Her”. Hannah knew that Owen was referring to his daughter, Bailey, her sixteen year old stepdaughter. Why would Bailey need protection? Then unexpectedly a US Marshall out of Austin, Texas arrived at the house. His interest in Owen and his disappearance raised many questions in Hannah’s mind. Why would a US Marshall from Austin be interested in her husband’s disappearance? Was there a connection between Owen and Austin? Would Bailey be able to put her dislike and distrust for Hannah aside to help her figure out who her father really was and why he disappeared from their lives? Both Hannah’s and Bailey’s relationship was about to be tested beyond any point they could have ever imagined. The Last Thing He Told Me was the first book that I read by Laura Dave. I would definitely look forward to reading other books by her in the future. This book, in my opinion, would make an excellent movie as well. I really enjoyed listening to this audiobook and recommend it very highly."
1303,2.0,"No. Edit: I guess I’m in the minority here but this book was all. over. the. place. And not in a good way. The author seemed to try really hard for it to be a thriller/suspense story but it just falls completely flat. For all the hype it got, I expected more. Skip!"
1304,3.0,"“There is nothing I wouldn’t do for my daughter.” The Last Thing He Told Me was a fast read that’s mostly a domestic drama focusing on the stepmother/stepdaughter relationship that evolved and strengthened as they tried to figure out what’s happened to Bailey’s father, Owen, who abruptly disappeared. Set in California and Texas and told in the present by Hannah, Owen’s wife, with an occasional chapter that flashed back to glimpse Owen, Hannah, and Bailey in successively older time periods. While the characters were likeable, I just didn’t connect with them or feel invested in their plight. So much was built up around Hannah’s life – her childhood with her grandfather, her friend Jules, her beginning relationship with Owen – but none of it helped me feel connected to her. Same goes for Owen. We find out about him through the flashbacks but that seemed bland. Bailey’s teenaged angsty act was the only character that seemed realistic, as did the transitioning points she experienced as she bonded with Hannah. After a sedate start, the mystery had me engaged and anxious to find out how the pieces all fit together. That momentum kept me turning the pages (when I should have been doing other things) until about 80ish% mark where, essentially the mystery had been solved. There was only to work out what life would look like going forward to reveal – and that part lost me. It veered from my expectations of where I thought the plot was going (or should have) and left me feeling dissatisfied. Readers who enjoy domestic fiction exploring themes like love and sacrifice, good and evil, faith, hope, inner strength may like this story. Hannah’s central concern was to protect Bailey. From what, was the question she had to figure out. Drawing on wisdom passed down from her grandfather, Hannah did her best to protect Bailey at all costs. Watching my grandfather work taught me that not everything was fluid. There were certain things that you hit from different angles, but you never gave up on. You did the work that was needed, wherever that work took you. "
1305,3.0,"A husband disappears immediately after his boss is arrested by the FBI; leaving his daughter and newlywed wife a cryptic ""Protect Her"" message. Also left was a large duffle bag filled with $600K. Although the husband's newlywed wife and daughter don't agree on many things, they agree that the husband's disappearance is out of character and form a reluctant alliance to discover the truth about his disappearance and whereabouts.This low-key domestic suspense drama was well-written, fast-paced, and boasted strong character development. Unfortunately, the book fell apart as soon as clues about the husband's past began to surface. The last portion of the book was contrived and implausible ---and, quite frankly, left me rolling my eyes and very disappointed.I listened to the audiobook and the narrator was good but not great. This was my second Laura Dave book and even though the ending of this book failed to resonate with me, I certainly will be looking forward to reading future titles by this author.3.5 stars."
1306,4.0,"In Laura Dave’s unputdownable new novel, Hannah is happily married to Owen, and trying her best to get Owen’s 16-year-old daughter to accept her, or at the very least, to not actively dislike her. Owen and Hannah met and married and moved in together in his Sausalito floating home, all within the space of two years. But suddenly, their life is irreparably disrupted.Owen’s tech company’s CEO is arrested for fraud and stock manipulation. It’s a huge scandal, but making matters worse for Hannah and Bailey is that Owen disappears as the news breaks. He hasn’t been arrested, and he hasn’t been directly implicated or accused of wrong-doing. Instead, he simply vanishes, leaving Hannah a scrawled note telling her to protect Bailey.Hannah can’t believe that Owen is anything but a victim of circumstance, but his cryptic note confuses her. She’s even more disturbed when a Federal Marshal and then the FBI come knocking on her door, all looking for information on Owen’s whereabouts. With no way to reach Owen and no idea what he could be hiding, Hannah suggests to Bailey that they take matters into their own hands and go look for him instead.Based on some loose memories of Bailey’s from her early childhood, as well as hints from some of Owen’s stories of his college days, they’re soon on his trail — but Hannah is horrified to discover that none of the history Owen shared with her seems to be true. Not his real name, not his family background, not his education… and if all of this is fabricated, then who really is this man she fell in love with and married?Despite her own fears, Hannah realizes that she needs to honor Owen’s request to keep Bailey safe, even if Bailey seem to detest her and even if she doesn’t actually know what she’s protecting her from. But as they travel together to a new town and track down seemingly random facts and vague clues, they come to realize that they only have one another to rely on… and as they start putting the puzzle pieces together, Hannah becomes more and more certain that she may not like the answers she finds.The Last Thing He Told Me is an intricately plotted web of misdirection and secrets. Through flashbacks, we see Hannah and Owen’s courtship and marriage, and learn the stories he shared with Hannah about his past. In the present, we see Hannah being truly there for Bailey, and Bailey’s grudging realization that Hannah might be the only person in the world she can fully count on.There are deep, dark, dangerous secrets to be uncovered, and harsh truths for both Hannah and Bailey to confront. Ultimately, Hannah faces a decision that affects all of their lives, and only she has the ability to make sure that she’s choosing a path that carries out Owen’s wishes for Bailey.I did not see where the story was going, and I was completely hooked on trying to figure out Owen’s secrets and why he behaved the way he did. Needless to say, the resolution was not what I expected! Kudos to the author for keeping me guessing all the way through!In addition to the puzzle of the events of the story and the truth behind Owen’s disappearance, I really liked the developing trust and connection between Hannah and Bailey. I came to respect and admire Hannah very much — she’s put in an impossible situation, with no good options, and finds a way to do the right thing even when it feels like the worst choice in the world.I picked up this book before it was announced that this would be the Hello, Sunshine choice for May. I’m delighted to see it getting so much attention! The Last Thing He Told Me is a gripping, fascinating read that practically demands to be discussed, and I think it would make a great book group selection.Highly recommended!"
1307,4.0,"Another book with a hubby seemingly going out one Morning and never returning, there is however a few different spins on this one, mainly the reason he has gone, which isen’t the one we are led to at first by the author and also the fact he leaves his new wife in charge of his daughter, these 2 then are thrust together and from a lets say difficult relationship have to learn to trust each other as they unravel the mystery, both play epic roles and their relationship is fascinating to watch evolveIt is a bit complicated when it gets to the bones of it but not so that it put me off and it’s a very very unexpected ending with a nice little added twist in the last few pagesGreat writing and characterisation and a different enough take on the missing spouse theme to make it stand out8/104 Stars"
1308,5.0,"I LOVED this book. I went into it blind and it was nothing at all what I expected. It was SO much more. I listened to it on Audible and the narration was wonderful. I loved how much the adults loved Bailey. How they accepted her exactly as she was.Owen's love was sacrificial and all-encompassing and heartbreaking and just beautiful. But I really loved Hannah's love for Bailey. A stepmother's love can be complicated but man...I love the way she loved Bailey without expectations or conditions. Without terms, ifs, ands, or buts. She loved her more than she loved herself. And that's rare. I don't want to say much because I want you all to experience it the way I did...so I'll just say this. Read it. It's the best book I've read recently.5 stars."
1309,1.0,"I received this book through Book of the Month. I poured myself a glass of wine, settled into my hammock chair on the back patio and relished the idea of a good read.As soon as I cracked open The Last Thing He Told Me, a bird pooped in it.Now, as far as I know, birds can't read, but I'm not Snow White. And so, rather than heed the obvious warning from my avian brethren, I snapped a picture for social media, wrote a quippy caption, and after making sure the bird didn't poop in my wine, I read it anyway.Turns out birds can read, and never again will I doubt their taste in literature.This book is boring.If I can skip five pages, skim the sixth, and still know what's going on, that's not good. Based on the writing, I am legitimately not certain this author has ever heard anyone have a conversation before. The dialogue is like listening to a drunk uncle tell you about that trip he took to Florida in '85 where nothing happened.The author wastes no time dumping you directly into the problem, and that is exciting for approximately ten pages before it jumps backward like that same drunk uncle going, ""But before I go into that, I should go back, and tell you how she met Owen."" We all just wish you'd started there and hope to God this story has a point.Because the audience is never introduced to Owen and Hannah's relationship through anything but tiny flashbacks, I had no skin in the game, and therefore, did not care at all about what happened to these characters. Yes, it would be jarring to have your husband disappear one day, but since I've never met your husband, I literally could not care less about his fate. I actually cared more about her ex-fiance than her current husband. He seemed nice, and I'm not sure why she hated him so much.That is Problem One.Problem Two is that the author goes to great pains to create a conflict out of a situation with a relatively simple solution. The real problem is that the main character refuses to accept this relatively simple solution through the whole book for no reason other than burning curiosity and idiocy, which makes it increasingly frustrating to follow her around.And that leads me to Problem Three.The entire relationship in this book leans on the tired trope of evil stepmother and bratty, entitled stepdaughter and their journey to closeness. I am so very tired of every step-relationship being built on this trope. I had to endure the attitude of a thoroughly unlikeable teen while she berates, ignores, and insults her eager to please stepmother who keeps her pain inside like a true winner. The problem is that we, the audience, are inside for every agonizing moment of Hannah's self doubt. The result is that I disliked both of them very much by the end.In closing, if a bird poops in a book you are about to read, take the warning."
1310,3.0,"I thought it sounded really interesting so I was happy to get to read it early. Hannah's husband Owen, whom she's been married to for a year, disappears. But before he does, he manages to smuggle her a note that simply says ""protect her"", and nothing more. She knows that the note means his 16 yr old daughter Bailey who's mother passed away when she was young, and she also wants nothing to do with Hannah. The FBI is interested in Owen! Hannah and Bailey set out to find out who owen truly is. This was not a thriller, but a domestic suspense. You see the relationship between Hannah and Bailey develop through the story, and how they become closer realizing that they may have to live a life without Owen. I feel this was more of a character driven story. It was a quick read, but it was just slow for me!Thank you to netgalley and the publisher for the gifted copy, all opinions are my own!"
1311,4.0,"Owen and Hannah have been married just a couple of years when a teen shows up at the door of their houseboat in Sausalito, CA, with a note from Owen. He's paid the girl $20 to deliver it--supposedly his phone is broken. The note reads ""Protect her."" Huh? Owen must mean his teenaged daughter Bailey but protect her from what? Why didn't he find a way to call? She tries calling him and leaves several increasingly-frustrated messages on his cell phone. Later that evening while picking her step-daughter up from school, she hears a news report on NPR that Owen's tech firm, The Shop, has been raided by the SEC and FBI and they've taken the CEO into custody. Has Owen gone into hiding to avoid arrest? When Bailey gets into the car, she's carrying a duffle bag that her dad apparently left in her locker that contains thousands of dollars. What in the world is going on?Hannah and Bailey have a difficult relationship at best but find it necessary now to team up to try to find Owen. Hannah soon learns from an investigator that Owen is NOT who he says he is. What would drive him to lie about his past? Hannah and Bailey begin following up on some clues that Owen let slip in unguarded moments but where will this lead and will it put them in danger too? Very intriguing! Laura Dave has a good, easy-reading style that keeps the reader turning pages till the end. What Hannah knows about Owen is revealed in flashbacks to the early days of their relationship. Can we ever really know another person? We tend to trust those we love, but that trust can be utterly destroyed when a devastating secret is revealed. I liked and cared about both Hannah and Bailey and cheered them on to the satisfying ending. I received an arc of this new suspense novel from the publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks for the opportunity. Laura Dave is quickly becoming a favorite suspense author of mine!"
1312,4.0,"The Last Thing He Told MeBy Laura DaveThis book had an interesting start. Hannah gets a visit from a young student with a note from her husband, Owen. All it says is “protect her.” Hannah assumes it means her difficult, sixteen-year-old stepdaughter, Bailey, but doesn’t understand why her beloved husband of two years would send her this note. She sits up most of the night waiting for him, but he doesn’t come home. The next thing she knows she and Bailey are thrown into the middle of a maelstrom concerning Owen, the company he works for and a major fraud investigation. Owen has disappeared leaving her in charge of his daughter who despises her.What follows is learning that the husband she loves is not the man she thought he was. Fed up with the FBI and the US Marshals, she and Bailey embark on their own investigation leading them into danger and discoveries maybe better left buried.This story is very character driven and I was hooked from almost the start. In fact, I read this book in one sitting. I would classify this as a mystery/ suspense and the ending left me with a tear in my eye. I gave it four stars and look forward to reading more by this author."
1313,5.0,"From beginning to end- this was the perfect mystery/thriller for me. Smart, quick paced, engaging and emotional. I couldn't read it fast enough. The writing was clever, the characters were authentic and the story felt fresh. In particular- I loved the dynamic between Hannah and Bailey. And I found the ending so satisfying."
1314,5.0,"I was lucky enough to be an early reader of this book. Get ready for a fabulous exploration of motherhood, loyalty and love, all packed in a tense thriller. Bravo!"
1315,5.0,"my wife and I agree ... a fantastic read ... an intricate blending of current and prior events, meticulously presented, exposing the plot one excruciating piece at a time ... forces the reader to face the most difficult choices, balancing suspense and emotion, never losing the edge"
1316,4.0,This book is not a fast-paced thriller. It is more of a slow burn.I was along for the ride with Hannah and Bailey trying to discover what happened to Owen. Was he in danger? Were they in danger? Was Owen who they thought he was?Bailey was very much every Stepmothers worst nightmare in the beginning. Hannah seemed a little too moon-eyed for someone who's Husband disappeared without a word. I was quickly invested in the mystery surrounding Owen's disappearance. The audiobook was a quick and easy listen.
1317,5.0,"*** Happy pub day ***The is a terrific suspense thriller. I was so involved with the characters and story that I finished the book in two sittings. It is a book that puts to the test just how far one is willing to go for those he/she loves. It tests the bonds between father and daughter and husband and wife. I couldn't believe the sacrifices made in the name of love. Hannah and Owen have only been married two years and things are tense as Hannah tries to squeeze into a family that, since the death of his first wife many years ago, has just been Owen and his now 16-year old daughter, Bailey. There's nothing like a broody 16-year old to make things difficult. Things go even more awry when Owen suddenly disappears leaving Hannah only a cryptic note to protect Bailey. Then news hits that Owen's boss has been arrested on fraud charges and further arrests of high ranking officers, possibly including Owen, are imminent. Is that why Owen left? So he wouldn't be arrested? Hannah thinks there's more to his disappearance than that and she and Bailey form an uneasy alliance to find out why Owen has vanished. With the FBI and US Marshall Service after Owen, Hannah and Bailey are racing to find him first. What they uncover is not at all what they expected. Owen has secrets far more threatening than anything related to his work. They find that they don't really know the Owen he professed to be.This is a powerful book about family dynamics and love that made me think in terms of my own family and what I would give up for them. I don't know if I could be as strong as Owen. True to its genre, the book has twists that while not totally unpredictable, are surprising. My only complaint was the sudden bonding between Bailey and Hannah. I just don't think it would happen that easily. This book is a solid 4.5 stars.Thank you NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for the opportunity to read this ARC in exchange for an honest review."
1318,5.0,"Wow, just wow. A story about love, loyalty, and sacrifice. This one will stick with me for awhile. Favorite 2021 read so far."
1319,4.0,"For some reason, this one didn't initially grab me - maybe it was the Ponzi scheme storyline or the somewhat slow start, but about the halfway mark, it really took off, and I ended up thoroughly enjoying it! The back cover blurb doesn't do the plot justice: Owen Michaels disappears, but before he does, he leaves a note to his new wife, Hannah, which says only, ""Protect her."" Despite her confusion, Hannah knows exactly to whom the note refers: Owen’s sixteen-year-old daughter, Bailey. Bailey, whose mother died as a child, and who wants absolutely nothing to do with her new stepmother, Hannah. Within hours of receiving the note, the FBI arrests Owen’s boss, and a US Marshal and FBI agents arrive at their home asking questions about Owen and what she knows. Hannah does not know who to trust or what is happening, but she quickly realizes her husband is not who he said he was, and that Bailey holds the key to figuring it all out. The two form a reluctant alliance and together set out to discover the truth. From that description, it sounds rather underwhelming, but as Hannah and Bailey start putting together the pieces of Owen’s past, nothing (and I mean nothing) is as it seems, and the truth is way more complicated than either of them could have imagined. The story begins in Sausalito, California and moves to Austin, Texas, and the chapters set in Austin kept me continually saying, ""wait, what?!"" I thought the execution was brilliant, and for most of the book, I had no clue how things would ultimately play out or who were the ""bad guys"" and who were the ""good guys."" I liked both Hannah and Bailey's characters (even if at times, I found four-year-old Bailey's stellar memory a bit implausible). The plot's strength is really their relationship and their growing bond, as Bailey slowly begins to understand and accept Hannah's desire to protect and love her as a daughter.The underwhelming start keeps this from being a 5-star read for me, but overall, I did find myself very invested in the story and the characters. Just be prepared that this is not a thriller, per se, but more of a domestic suspense. This was my first Laura Dave book, but I would definitely be open to reading more of her work. 4 stars."

1321,3.0,"This book is the latest buzz book, probably thanks to Reese Witherspoon highlighting it and making it one of her Hello Sunshine Book Club picks, with 5 star reviews galore. Perhaps, considering this, my expectations were just too high.Hannah is happily married to Owen when he suddenly disappears just as the software company he works for is exposed by the FBI for fraud. Owen’s only contact with Hannah before fleeing is a note simply saying, ‘protect her’. Hannah knows Owen is talking about his 16 year old daughter, Bailey, whose mother had been killed in a car crash when she was very young. Despite Bailey and Hannah’s relationship being rocky, they both agree that Owen would not be guilty of anything the FBI are implying so they team up to further investigate themselves.It all sounds better on paper. The revelations which Hannah and Bailey discover are not particularly original or unique. Their methods of investigating were nothing special either. In fact, a lot of it involved Hannah and/or Bailey conveniently remembering something from the past. Hannah is an okay character but I’m afraid Bailey just acted like a spoilt brat. I know how teenagers act, I have two spoilt ones of my own, but I’m afraid Hannah comes across as a saint for putting up with Bailey.One positive was that I did enjoy the place settings: Austin and its friendly university city vibes, and Sausalito and its cute floating homes. Overall the book is readable but it’s nothing special. Whilst reading I kept waiting for something (a twist?) that was going to elevate the book and help me understand its popularity. But it never came. 3 out of 5"
1322,3.0,"This is a very easy-reading suspense novel, and although I agree with other reviewers that this is not a fast-paced book, that never bothered me. I enjoyed the plot, as it's a bit different to other mysteries I've read this year. I though the structure of the book, with flashback chapters, worked well. The strongest element was Hannah and her relationship with Bailey.The Story: Before Owen Michaels disappears, he smuggles a note to his beloved wife of one year: Protect her, referring to his sixteen-year-old daughter, Bailey."
1323,5.0,"I received an ARC from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.WOW!!! I started reading this book this morning and just finished it. I could not put this down.Hannah's life is upended when she receives a note from her husband to ""protect her"". She knows immediately this means his daughter. Her husband is missing and she starts to piece together clues from her life with him and discovers he is not who she thought he was. But she loves Owen and she is determined to keep his daughter, Bailey safe. This story has many twists and turns that keep you hooked until the very end. "
1324,4.0,"QUICK TAKE: Found this to be a very solid, SOLID thriller. Nothing too outside-the-box or revolutionary, but it made for an enjoyable Saturday afternoon and I thought LD did a nice job building the relationship and character arcs of the MC and her step-daughter."
1325,4.0,"My favorite thing about this book was that it turned the wicked stepmother cliche on its head. Instead of a step monster, Laura Dave presents us with a loving and loyal woman who'd do anything for the child she didn't raise. I like that she's fallible too. Overall, a very good read. "
1326,2.0,"The first half is good, the second half is horrible. I hate books where people are savvier than they should be or more noble than they would be. I makes for great allegories but terrible novels. The build up is just simply not worth it. It's like the author did no research into how crime syndicates work. She pulled the most shallow material she could think of, likely based off something she watched on law & order, and then surrounded the story with flimsy innuendo so that she didn't actually have to get into depth about the characters, the crimes or the motives.Spoilers below  Hannah is a woodworker. She marries Owen who is a tech WonderWorker and he has a bitchy little teenage daughter Bailey. I don't feel at all bad about calling her that- because she is. That's the other thing: it is so apparent to me that this author has either no experience with teenagers or only bad experience. whenever a teenager is written as petulant and self-righteous and self-involved as an author can possibly make them, I know that they have no experience. Yes teenagers can be those things, but they can also be hilarious helpful and surprisingly delightful. It was just a huge huge annoyance of mine throughout the whole book. Owen goes missing. His business is in trouble for some type of genetic federal financing crime. That basically never comes back into it which is really really really really really really odd. It's sold that he is just this tech savant... And then that never ends up mattering whatsoever in the end.Long story short, Owen runs. On very flimsy information Hannah decides to try to track down information of him in Austin Texas with his daughter in tow. I'm still in it at this point.Then it rapidly loses me. They stumble upon information about him having sold out people in a crime syndicate but they absolutely point blank refused to tell us all the bad stuff that he did. Then she immediately, and with no character build-up, becomes super mom. She is literally willing to sacrifice her entire life's existence for her 2-year-old marriage and his 16-year-old brat. She's more benevolent of a mother than women who raise their own children would be. She's amazing. She's so loving. She's so brave.Also, there's this US Marshal guy who plays this really confusing role where he claims to have a ton of information about Owen but she doubts his information... And then they never explain what it is one way or the other and why this guy is so invested.Ugh if it's just... Just... Just no. "
1327,5.0,"The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave is definitely a page-turner!This is the story of a husband who disappears after leaving a cryptic note for his wife. Owen is missing, he has abandoned Hannah, his wife of just a year, and his beloved teenage daughter Bailey.Hannah and Bailey work together to unravel past secrets and discover that it's quite possible the man they both knew and loved isn't really who they thought.A captivating beginning, full of mystery and intense family drama, with a tear jerking ending.A praiseworthy read!Thank you to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster Canada for an arc of this novel in exchange for my honest review."
1328,4.0,"The Last Thing He Told Me was a compelling read. I found myself frequently wondering what I would do in the characters' shoes. Would I make the same choices? Just an all around good book and one that I'm still thinking about a week after I finished it. The less you know ahead of time, the better when it comes to this story. The bare minimum is husband and father Owen Michaels has gone missing. His wife and daughter are desperate for answers. Alright, that's enough! Enjoy the book!The story alternates between the present with everyone looking for Owen and key moments in the past that provide context to his disappearance. The mystery elements are strung along fairly well so you just have to sit back and watch everything unfold as it would be difficult to predict every single detail. The characters aren't people I particularly cared for but I still felt invested in their lives.Definitely recommend as there's a little something for every reader. You got some mystery, some thrilling elements, and plenty of stuff to analyze in regards to the plot and characters. "

1330,2.0,"I received a free copy from the publisher in exchange for my honest review. ’The Last Thing He Told Me’ is the story of Hannah; a woman who's husband suddenly disappears, leaving her with a step-daughter and lots of unanswered questions. The mystery of Owen’s disappearance was enough to keep me turning pages for a while... but the search for answers started to wear thin for me around the mid-point.My main problem with this book was I felt it was about the wrong person. The lead, Hannah, was bland and she seemed to stumble unwittingly upon someone else's far more dramatic story, which she herself had no part in. She just hears about it. So we, as the readers, have to hear about it too... rather than SEE IT for ourselves.The characters that were central to Owen's disappearance were only introduced about two thirds into the book... where all of a sudden we're learning the story of Hannah's missing-husband’s-ex-wife’s-brother’s-girlfriend's-cousin-twice-removed (I’ve exaggerated - but only very slightly!) The degrees of separation between Hannah and these important characters was confusing at first, and ultimately made Hannah feel like a redundant part of the story, despite her being the lead character. I also felt like I needed extensive knowledge of Owen’s family-tree to really follow... and since Owen himself hadn’t even appeared in the present-day timeline of the book, it was difficult to care about this extended family all that much.I also wonder if the basis of the story was fundamentally flawed; if Owen was the brilliant Dad he was painted to be, then he simply WOULDN’T have left his daughter with a woman who had no clue what danger his daughter was in. Not to mention a woman that his daughter didn’t even like. Leaving Bailey with Hannah didn't provide her any kind of protection at all. It just didn’t make sense. Unfortunately this all made it hard for me to really get behind the story and characters. But I did think it was an interesting concept that kept me intrigued at least for the first half."
1331,3.0,"""How do you explain it when you find in someone what you’ve been waiting for your whole life? Do you call it fate? It feels lazy to call it fate. It’s more like finding your way home—where home is a place you secretly hoped for, a place you imagined, but where you’d never before been. Home. When you weren’t sure you’d ever get to have one.""I did enjoy many aspects, but not sure how to rate this. "
1332,3.0,"Totally readable and mostly good. Easy writing style. Nothing special good or bad. Fine but not ínstense suspense for the first 3/4. It’s a little sincere for my taste. It’s also soooo incredibly white, which is fine, but also so shocking in this day and age. The lack of any social issues at all makes for an easy read."
1333,4.0,"The theme ""how well do you REALLY know your spouse"" never gets old for me in a mystery. There are so many endless possibilities: your partner is a serial killer, a spy, an undercover agent, an alien life form from another planet, a person in witness protection, an undercover agent, a robot, a polygamist who has another three wives in different states. The skill lies a) in hooking the reader and getting them emotionally invested; and b) in the gradual unveiling of the mystery, like the unwrapping of a pass-the-parcel where the final product is something the reader has coveted all along. It's been done so many times before that it's not easy to come up with a premise a diehard thriller fan won't work out in the first few chapters. And whilst THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME didn’t reinvent the wheel, the gradual offering up of clues was intriguing and kept me eagerly reading on!It's exactly in this very predicament Hannah finds herself in when her husband Owen fails to come home one night, leaving her only with a short cryptic note delivered to her door: “Protect her.” “Her” meaning his beloved teenage daughter Bailey. Hannah knows that he would never willingly leave Bailey unless something was terribly wrong. The more she looks into Owen's past in the hope of finding him, the more Hannah realises that she doesn't know her husband at all. Was everything he has told her about himself a lie?Laura Dave knows all the tricks of hooking her readers and taking them along for the ride. I loved the sense of danger and suspense as Hannah's life unravelled and the gradual unveiling of clues that had me questioning everything. As Hannah's search for the truth put her own life in danger, the atmosphere became more claustrophobic and I constantly questioned what I would do if I was in her situation, even if I thought that Hannah remained surprisingly calm considering the circumstances. Which was probably my only little quibble with the story and the one thing that stood in my way of bonding emotionally with Hannah - maybe I'm just more emotionally unstable? I think I would have believed her predicament a bit better if she'd shown more vulnerability in an impossibly difficult situation. I also wasn’t totally convinced with Owen’s motives and thinking processes, but without his POV of the mess he got himself in it was tough to judge!That said, THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME held plenty of surprises in store and entertained from beginning to end. It will appeal to readers who enjoy a slower, character driven mystery with a slow unravelling of clues rather than an action packed, suspenseful read. It relies on the unspoken secrets in a marriage that can turn our lives upside down in an instant, and the relationship dynamics in step families. I enjoyed it and look forward to reading more from this author in future.3.5 starsThank you to Netgalley and Serpent's Tail for the free electronic copy of this novel and for giving me the opportunity to provide an honest review. *blog*  *facebook*  *instagram* "

This was the first book I read by this author. I thought the writing was good and it kept me interested. I read this one pretty quickly and look forward to checking out more of Dave's work. "

1337,4.0,"This was a solid 3.5 stars for me. No more, no less. But I'm rounding up rather than down because it held my interest. It kept me reading right on through, so that I essentially finished it in one sitting, with a few little breaks. And what more can one ask of a book on a hot day when you just want to curl up in a cool room and enjoy the blessing of air conditioning? Hannah and her step-daughter Bailey have a bit of an adversarial relationship, because...teenage girl. But then they team up to do a little far-fetched super-sleuthing to figure out what happened to Bailey's father Owen, who has disappeared, leaving behind cryptic notes and wads of moolah. They get a little more than they bargained for, because Owen is not who they thought he was. Dun dun dun!It made me want to go to Sausalito, but not to Austin. "
1338,4.0,"Married for just over a year, Hannah Hall’s husband, Owen Michaels, disappears. The CEO of The Shop where Owen worked as a programmer has been taken into custody for fraud. Is Owen also guilty of wrongdoing? The only message Owen gets to Hannah is “Protect Her”—his beloved 16-year-old daughter Bailey. Bailey has been slow to accept her new stepmother so it is a bit awkward as the two of them seek answers as to where Owen could have gone. Their journey to trust each other is the main thrust of the story.While there is a suspenseful aspect to the plot, this is really a story about families and what they do to keep each other safe. Enjoy!"
1339,4.0,"Wow, that was fun! I don't know what I expected, but probably not exactly something like this. This story took a completely different direction.I really like the fast pace in my novels, and here I felt that every scene had a purpose. Every scene and every conversation was here for some reason. They brought us closer to discovering the mystery, they added another element to this puzzle. This is a well-edited book.I also liked the main character Hannah. Despite the very unusual situation she finds herself in, she does not lose her head and tries to do her best to deal with the situation and protect her stepdaughter, just as her husband Owen asked her to do. Hannah is quick to think and not afraid to act. She is a strong heroine who can think outside the box and act on the spot.The difficult relationship between Hannah and her stepdaughter Bailey added extra drama and another interesting dimension to the story. We not only wonder what is going on with Owen, but also whether the relationship between Hannah and Bailey would eventually improve. And whether it will happen fast enough that none of them will get hurt.The ending surprised me. I didn't think this story would end like this. I even wonder if I'm a bit disappointed, but that's because I just like happy endings, and this one doesn't quite feel like one to me. Either way, the ending is interesting.I really enjoyed discovering Owen's secrets gradually. And while I think some of Hannah's actions weren't entirely rational (like going to Austin, for example) and there are some holes in the story, I had no problem overlooking them and enjoying the story."
1340,4.0,"Well this one was a nice surprise. Hugely enjoyable quick read. When newly married Hannah receives a note from her husband of one year Owen, with just the words “protect her” before he disappears, she knows he is talking about his 16 year old daughter Bailey. Bailey who lost her mother when she was young and has not taken to Hannah at all. When Owens boss is arrested for fraud and first a US Marshall and then the FBI turn up on Hannah’s doorstep asking about Owen, she soon realises that Owen isn’t the man he said he was. The question is, who exactly is he and what secrets does he hold that have made him disappear off the face of the Earth?Hannah and Bailey reluctantly set out together to try and find out about Owens past, when Bailey was a little girl, too young to remember hers and Owens past life. This one was great fun. Light enough and doesn’t overstay it’s welcome. Fast paced, tight editing and story telling, it tells its story without over complicating the story(which could have easily happened given the story arc). The characters are well written and our central character Hannah is extremely likeable. A kind but strong and practical woman who will do whatever it takes to protect Bailey. A kind of thriller, a kind of buddy road book, this one zips along as I said and is an excellent read. Loved the ending too, which may not be everyone’s cup of tea. An author that wasn’t on my radar before but certainly is now. Many thanks to Netgalley and Serpents Tail/Viper/Profile Books for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. "
1341,5.0,"Wow! This book absolutely blew me away. It will be one of my favorite reads this year and next year since it doesn't even come out until 2021. Laura Dave has written her best book yet. I am still reeling from this book and an ending I never saw coming!Owen disappears but leaves his wife, Hannah a note saying Protect Her. Bailey, Owen's daughter comes home with cash. Neither of them know where Owen could have gone. Soon the FBI arrests Owen's boss and they are knocking on Hannah's door. This is when Hannah realizes Owen isn't who he says he is. Hannah and Bailey set out to discover just who Owen really is. What they discover neither of them could imagine. I loved how this book was told in the present and in flashbacks. The relationship Hannah had with her grandfather left a lasting impression on me as someone whose grandfather raised her too. Laura Dave did an incredible job building this relationship and weaving it throughout the book. This book was definitely suspenseful throughout and kept me guessing the entire time. I will be putting this book in everyone's hands next year!Add this to your TBR for May 2021.Thanks to the publisher Simon & Schuster and Netgalley for my advanced ebook copy. "
1342,2.0,"I am so perplexed by the extremely high number of 5-star reviews for this book from other readers. First, this is not a thriller. It would be better described as a family drama. Second, it's very hard to like a book when I don't care about the protagonist. I thought she was so terribly bland and boring."
1343,2.0,I was realy into this book it was interesting not fast paced but not slow either it was a good story till the end l mean wtf what sort of ending was that no wasn't happy with that ending at all :(
1344,5.0,"📚 Hello Book Friends! THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME by Laura Dave is a jaw-dropping read. The plot is intelligent, the characters well defined, and the ending perfect. I love how the author weaves the story and offers the reader many clues that make sense. I have read many books about angered teenagers lately and it was refreshing that the relationship between Hannah and her stepdaughter, Bailey, did not turn into a tragic family drama. The author kept is real. I loved this book. It is such a great read; perfect to bring with you to the beach or the cottage.#bookstadog #poodles #poodlestagram #poodlesofinstagram #furbabies #dogsofinstagram #bookstagram #dogsandbooks #bookishlife #bookishlove #bookstagrammer #books #booklover #bookish #bookaholic #reading #readersofinstagram #instaread #ilovebooks #bookishcanadians #canadianbookstagram #bookreviewer #bookcommunity #bibliophile #thelastthinghetoldme #lauradave #simonschuster #bookreview"
1345,3.0,"An easy and light summer read. With low-key suspense and mystery.I enjoyed it well enough. I'm very surprised by all the high praises though, as everything in this book is just average. By no means a bad book, but the thing I liked best about it was the step-mother - step-daughter relationship, which is actually a big plus, since we don't see this kind of relationship often. I'd mostly recommend it for the portrayal of this relationship. I'd say this book is about family, lack of communication and choices and their consequences, rather than a thriller."
1346,4.0,"“Protect Her”That’s all the note says. The last thing your husband tells you after he disappears without a trace, in a handwritten two word note delivered by a random girl from the elementary school. And then Hannah’s life is turned upside down trying to discover what has happened and why she needs to protect her stepdaughter. I liked this book; it was definitely my kind of read, it had a strong hook and was for the most part, a page turner, albeit a slow burn mystery. It’s not a thriller. I was curious and wanted to know what happened. I think it fell a little flat at parts in the middle, but, I didn’t guess the ending so that’s always a positive!3.75 ⭐️ "
1347,3.0,"This was an interesting trip for sure. I was so engrossed for the first two thirds and could hardly put it down. One of the reasons I rarely read thrillers like this is that they so rarely can finish well. This one did not, went from a five star read to a three by the end. So disappointing as it had so much going for it, too bad it could not sustain or finish it."
1348,1.0,"I like reading popular books. Contemporary fiction and thrillers usually have interesting sounding plots, and are quick and easy books to read somewhat mindlessly, which I need while trying to work through fantasy series or other long, more brain intensive reads. But honestly I don’t often find them living up to the hype. And that means I’m going to be full of unpopular opinions. 😂🤷🏻‍♀️This book was just not good. Right away the writing drove me nuts. Lots of clunky descriptions that made no sense, and back to back sentences that said literally the same thing. I was finding these problems every couple of pages throughout the book. I can see how it could possibly be the dialect of the narrator, as it’s written in first person, but it was very poorly done if that was the intent.The plot was alright at first. It was interesting enough that I kept reading. But halfway through I was getting bored. Also, there were many instances where the decisions made seemed irrational, and everything was rather far-fetched, and the ending had no real impact on me. The only reason I kept reading after the halfway point was that the book wasn’t too long and it read really quickly.The one star rating feels kind of harsh, as I didn’t hate the book. But the poor writing, mediocre plot, and total forgetability means I can’t rate it any higher. "
1349,4.0,"probably close to 4.5 You’ve probably seen this one around since it was a @reesesbookclub pick this month & maybe you’ve wondered if it’s worth the hype….in my opinion - YES it’s totally worth the hype🙌. ✅ I LOVE when someone disappears- in this case it was the husband & I needed to know what happened, if he was alive & how Or if Hannah can figure it out✅ the narrator Rebecca Lowman was fantastic ✅ the pace, short chapters, and characters to root for were so well developed ✅this was a SMART, subtle psych thriller that kept me listening late into the night!✅I love a good epilogue & this one was excellent Thanks to @simonandschuster for the #freebook #partner "

1351,1.0,"There was sooooooo much hype for this book that I assumed it had to be somewhat good. No, it really isn’t. Boring, depressing, blah. Just stop following the hype already. "

1353,4.0,"Hannah makes handmade wood furniture. Owen is a coder for a tech firm named The Shop. The recently wed couple live on a floating home in Sausalito. After a tough childhood, Hannah is deeply in love. Her only big challenge is developing a close relationship with Owen’s teenage daughter Bailey, who has yet to warm up to her new stepmother. Their lives turn upside down when a note from Owen is delivered to her door. “Protect her” is all it says. Owen is gone. His company is under investigation for fraud. The CEO of his company has been arrested. When both a U.S. Marshall and then the FBI show up at her home, Hannah shockingly learns that Owen is not who he says he is. She decides that to truly protect Bailey, she needs to uncover the secrets that have been kept from her.The Last Thing He Told Me is an intriguing story told in the past and present. While this is a mystery and has some suspense, the core of the story is the bond that starts to form between Hannah and Bailey. The premise is very strong and the book was heading towards a 5-star rating before the mystery started to be solved. I enjoyed the book but it ended up falling just a little short. I will certainly watch the Apple TV+ adaptation which is in the works, to star Julia Roberts as Hannah."
1354,4.0,"I loved this story. Usually suspenseful stories like this are a fun read for me but I don’t get much emotional depth out of them, but this one was so different. A rich family story coupled with the tension of the “where is he?” storyline. I loved Hannah and Bailey, love the not-quite-mother-daughter dynamic. Read it in two days. Highly recommend."
1355,3.0,"3* I liked this book, but I loved her book, Eight Hundred Grapes. I think the girls in my book club are going to love this one though. I highly recommend Eight Hundred Grapes by this writer."
1356,4.0,"Very good book, really flowed well."
1357,1.0,"For about 70 percent of this book, I more or less enjoyed it. I was intrigued about what Owen was hiding and I enjoyed Hannah’s relationship with Bailey.First there were little things that bothered me (Hannah being stumped by what college football team plays in Texas and wears orange.. so she decides to call her ex fiancé at midnight and ask rather than google... also I have nothing more than a cursory knowledge of college football and even I know the answer to that). Then Hannah started to become an extremely unreliable narrator, introduced to us as totally in the dark... but then they’d flash back and give REALLY suspicious hints about Owen that she knew the whole time.But the real nail in the coffin for me was making Nicholas out to be some Thanos style villain legitimately saying things like Hannah was making a “deal with the devil” painting him out to be some horrible monster for the cardinal sin of... being a defense attorney? Taking cheap shots at Public defenders for representing people accused of crimes is lazy, dated writing that shows a complete lack of understanding of the criminal justice system. And the author didn’t even try to cover it up with any real explanation of illegal behavior by Nicholas. (She never even really explains what he went to prison for? Vaguely indicating it was somehow connected to being a defense attorney). Instead she said things like “the prosecutor was lazy, and I got him off.” And then having Hannah snark at that with comments about how her morals wouldn’t allow her to defend people. Well guess what? The right to a defense is quite literally in the constitution. I don’t know what prosecutor/law enforcement were feeding the author information, but she got it grossly wrong. "

I raced through this book. I was immediately drawn to all of the characters, and loved reading the before chapters to see Owen through a new lens and each chapter was a fantastic way to get to know the relationship between Hannah and Owen better. And then we learn the after and Hannah and the read are privy not just to new facts, but to the thoughts, deepest fears, and secret motivations that Owen has for what he did. The Last Thing He Told Me unwinds in such unbelievable, unbearable suspense, and I could not put it down until the last page. This is a story that rewards the reader, it's as if Laura Dave sensed my weariness of all the formulaic, predictable thrillers, and wrote this book as a tribute to what crime fiction can be when it's done really well. Now while I agree not everything is exactly plausible in this story, the fact that I couldn't stop turning the pages and I felt the suspense right along with the characters makes me feel it is deserving of four stars.Disclosure:Thank you NetGalley, Simon & Schuster and Laura Dave for the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an impartial review; all opinions are my own.#TheLastThingHeToldMe #NetGalley"
1359,4.0,"Genre: Suspense & ThrillerPublisher: Simon & SchusterPub. Date: May 4, 2021Martie's Rating 3 1/2 StarsMini-ReviewThe premise of the story is about a loving husband and father who goes missing. His wife and daughter set out to track him down. The story jumps back and forth in time, chronicling the wife's early days with her spouse as well as her current search for him. Her life now revolves around the FBI, US Marshalls, and her husband’s dangerous family that she never knew he had. The tale is rather farfetched. But, the changing nature of the relationship between the both stunned wife and stepdaughter is what drives the story. At least, that is what caught this reviewer’s interest.

1360,2.0,"This book wasn't very thrilling for a thriller or even a slow burn mystery, just fairly dull and boring, completely lacking any originality, great characters, a plot that was halfway believable or really any necessary component of a decent book. The writing....oh boy. She does go off on a lot of tangents and she does provide a lot of detail when detail is not needed and when detail is needed she keeps it from us. I didn't relate to any of the characters I couldn't find any of the characters interesting in any way and didn't care about any of them. I kept hoping for more but more never showed up. Meh 😕 too bad"
1361,5.0,"0_0 Wow! Do I ever consider myself lucky to have found this book (a Lucky Day find) on the shelf at my library. This is the first time I've read Ms. Dave and I'm now keen to see what else my library has of hers. 
The Last Thing He Told Me
 was riveting from page 1. If I could function at work without sleep, I would have read straight through the night to finish this in one day. No matter. I was able to savor it more by taking a few days with it. And I loved every minute.Full review to come..."
1362,3.0,Fun but somewhat predictable. The book did not stay with me like some of my favorite mysteries. Part of the problem for me was the characters were not that interesting or original. I enjoyed the first part of the book more than the end which felt cliched. Three stars.
1363,2.0,There’s the suspension of disbelief then there’s this book.
1364,2.0,Unfortunately this was a big miss for me. I found myself not caring about the story or the characters. It dragged most of the way although the first half was more enticing.
1365,4.0,"3.5⭐ Last thing Owen Michael tell her wife Hannah is ""Protect her"" And so a mysterious ride begins with Hannah who is only a year and half married to Owen, finds a note Owen leaves on regular day and ghost her, no way to reach owen, hannah is frantic and need some explanation on Owens disappearance.Owne leave behind Bailey his daughter who lost her mother when she was four years old and have no memories of her existence. With owen gone hannah and bailey go down the past to get some answers.The story is gripping from the start it kept getting better until the end which I felt was very farfetched.I loved the chemistry and understanding between owne and hannah. It is different from other domestic thriller where husband goes missing and turns out to be a jerk. Characters are well built The ending dint do so much for me, but I enjoyed the book.🙂"
1366,1.0,"1.5/5I am genuinely so confused by these reviews. This is a contender for the worst book I've read in a long time. Or should I say: I am confused. I am so confused. I am so confused by these reviews. The book was bad. The book was so bad it stopped me in my tracks. I thought, how could a book be that bad? Which is essentially how the entire book was written. My boyfriend and I listened to this together as an audiobook and by the end we actually couldn't keep it together because of how bad it was. In addition to the writing, there are so many blaring problems with this book its hard to name them all. The entire ""The Shop"" plotpoint just...goes away? There are a bunch of things that happen in the beginning that have actually no bearing on anything at all and are never mentioned again. Smack in the middle of the book everything is explained, straight up. She just discovers what happened immediately and that's the entire book. Blah blah blah mafia. She just explains the entire thing? And thats it? And the only reason she and Bailey don't go into the witness protection program is so that Bailey can keep her name and be in the school play? It's a nightmare from start to finish. And the main character, who has about as much personality as a wet paper towel, feels inclined to explain every thought that goes through her head every waking moment of the day, in multiple different sentences (see above), mostly about how Bailey is an eye-rolling miserable irritated 16 year old but she just loves her so much and she must PROTECT HER (you will hear this no less than 234897 times throughout the book). The only reason I didn't give this a 1 is because I reserve that for books I didn't finish. If only."
1367,4.0,"Hannah receives a knock at her front door and there stands an unknown girl with a letter in her hands. This letter is from her husband and contains just two words: protect her. The 'her' in question must refer to her husband's teenage daughter, Bailey. But what does she need to protect her from? And why isn't her father going to be there to do so?This was such a twisted read. Concerns over the missing husband and father, Owen, made up much of the first portion of the novel but as the two women he left behind begin their own search discrepancies in his past began to be uncovered.As each chapter passed by I had about ten more questions forming. I had no idea in which direction this novel was heading and this remained so until the very end. Thrills and twists dominated, which is exactly what I desired from this read, and ensured that Laura Dave is an author I will look forward to reading from again.I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Thank you to the author, Laura Dave, and the publisher, Viper, for this opportunity."
1368,4.0,"Sinister, sharp, and engrossing!The Last Thing He Told Me transports you into the life of Hannah Hall, whose world gets turned upside down when her husband suddenly disappears one day, and she reluctantly must delve into his past that seems to be a lot more complex and contain more long-buried secrets than she ever could have imagined.The writing is tight and intense. The characters are mysterious, troubled, and multilayered. And the plot intertwines and unravels quickly into a suspenseful, intricate tale of lies, secrets, manipulation, parenthood, familial drama, unexpected twists, heart-wrenching motivations, violence, and deception.Overall, The Last Thing He Told Me is a tortuous, clever, heartbreaking page-turner by Dave that keeps you guessing from the very first page and, ultimately, leaves you shocked, surprised, and thoroughly entertained.Thank you to Simon & Schuster Canada for providing me with a copy in exchange for an honest review."
1369,4.0,"The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave is a great read! I had absolutely no clue what I was starting when I picked this one up and I had never read this author before, either. This story will grip you with the prologue! Then it goes on to establish a solid character background with part one and completely captivates the reader for parts two and three. I was drawn into this story and couldn't put it down until I knew the answer to the mystery. This is a compelling mystery with a very touching and sincere subplot exploring the relationship between a step mother and daughter. The tension is realistic and palatable. There were parts I had ""figured out"" or ""predicted"" but that did not take away from my enjoyment of the story at all. I thoroughly enjoyed this read and would recommend it to anyone looking for a mild thriller with a great mystery. Thank you Netgalley, Simon & Schuster, and Laura Dave for a #gifted copy of this book. "
1370,5.0,"Terrific book. A real page Turner. I actually feel like I know Owen, Bailey and Hannah particularly well. The author did an excellent job with character development of everyone in this book. Highly recommended. I look forward to the movie. "
1371,3.0,"I loved the first 80 percent of this book and couldn’t put it down—Hannah, Owen and Bailey were characters I felt invested in and and the plot was fast-paced and engrossing—but the ending ruined the book for me. I HATED it.Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the ARC I received."
1372,5.0,Absolutely loved it. Full review soon!
1373,3.0,This was a fun one!
1374,5.0,I did not expect this book to be this good. I read it in one sitting was done with it before I know it. The mystery was a good one it was a fast paced read and one that you will be happy you read.
1375,5.0,"The Last Thing He Told Me by Larua DaveRATING: 4.5/5 STARS A compelling mystery novel that pivots around the disappearance of a husband/father. The story starts right away with the disappearance of Hannah's husband. All he leaves behind is a note that says ""protect her"" (his daughter). As a result, Hannah finds herself in a predicament where she is left to take care of her moody stepdaughter alone while simultaneously piecing together how and why her husband disappeared. What follows after a whirlwind of shocking revelations that will lead her to believe her husband is not who he says he is.Moving forward, I found this story to be quite addicting! I couldn't stop because it was written fluidly, had the right amount of clues per chapter, and the trail from one clue to the next felt natural. The big reveal and explanation at the end were also very satisfactory. I also loved the character developments and world-building, it was all mesmerizing. My favorite thing about this novel would be the relationship dynamics, it was subtle but had a great impact. There were some flashback chapters that I appreciated because they gave a 360 look into the role of Hannah's husband in the overall story. "
1376,2.0,وقتی فرد غائب آنقدر کاریزما ندارد تا خواننده به سرگذشتش علاقه مند شود،هیاهوی شخصیت‌ها تنها باعث آزار میشوند.کارتهای کتاب به شدت رو هستن و هیچ هیجانی بر نمی انگیزند.می ماند مسیر رسیدن به جواب که آن هم متاسفانه چنگی به دل نمی‌زند.
1377,2.0,"I had really high hopes for this book, mainly because of all the great reviews and the cute little “Reese’s Book Club” sticker on the front. I mean, the first review on the back of the book calls it “A thrilling roller coaster of a novel.” So...you know, I was hyped. Now, the set up and first act of the book I really liked! Husband goes missing, 2 clue notes and a bag of money left behind. A race to figure out what happened before the authorities, aka 2 FBI agents, 1 mysterious US Marshal and the news headlines at every Google news click nipping at their heels. Here’s my problem with this book: it fell so flat in the second half. I wouldn’t call this a roller coaster, I would call this a lucky stroll around Austin Texas finding out very convenient answers to ultimately boring questions. This book had a huge need for pacing, some kind of ticking time bomb to go up against and a formidable antagonist. Instead the FBI agents disappeared, the US Marshal turned out to be holding the answers of the past close to his vest for no reason at all. I mean, what was the point in pretending with Hannah? Just tell her Owen’s past and catch everyone up to speed! I thought for so long that Grady would be the leak at WITSEC. He was so angry at Hannah that they couldn’t find Owen that I was sure he wanted revenge or something interesting. But no. He was just annoying and fairly inconsequential to the plot. There was just no outside threat to our central characters that moved the story along in an urgent way. Why not have them on the run to Austin, dodging authorities and scrambling to figure these clues out? This was the number one news article in the country and they were allowed to just joyride around Texas for a bit? I really loved the church database hunting, and tracking the old professor down at college, all of that felt really juicy! But then came the answers, and I had to reread them several times because they were so...lack luster! I thought the whole time Owen had kidnapped Bailey as a little girl to protect her from bad guys or something. But it was just a straight witness protection story?? And Owen’s master plan was to just disappear forever once his very high profile job blew up in his face? If his daughter was everything to him, why not try a nice little quiet life job and keep a low profile? And why tell Hannah 2 words of an explanation?! “Protect her.” Thanks Owen. Clear as mud. Sigh. So many plot holes and I haven’t even gotten to the baddie grandpa who somehow ends up with his granddaughter in the end but not Owen?! On what planet would Bailey be okay with weekend visits to iHop with the man who was the catalyst for never seeing her father ever again? 😳Overall this was a huge disappointment to me. I think the “twist” everyone was raving about was the fact that nothing actually happened, surprise! Side note: The most unbelievable part of this story? That a professor who has a framed exam on his office wall for years can’t remember the name of that student. 🎤"
1378,4.0,"Entertainment: 5/5Believability: 1/5If you're a person who needs your suspense novels to be totally realistic, I don't think this will be one for you. However, if you just want a novel that you can't put down and will keep you glued to the page NEEDING to know what comes next, I highly recommend!When Owen's company is taken down during a raid and it comes to light that the business has been lying to the public and engaging in massive fraud, it doesn't look good that Owen up and disappears to avoid arrest or implication at the same time. Worse, he leaves his new wife, Hannah, and his daughter, Bailey, a bag full of cash and a note to Hannah simply saying ""Protect her"". Hannah, convinced of Owen's innocence despite how everything may look, decides to set off on an expedition with Bailey to uncover the truth. What she finds along the way will not only shock her and reveal that everything she knows about her husband may not be the truth, but also put her and Bailey in harm's way.This was a really fun read full of mystery and suspense. I wouldn't classify it as a thriller but it did keep me at the edge of my seat and it was fun trying to figure out just what the heck was going on! Regarding the believability, the storyline was admittedly pretty far fetched. Much of Hannah and Bailey solving the mystery relied on fragmented conversations and gut feelings Hannah remembered about Owen from years prior, and even more out there, memories Bailey pulled out of thin air from when she was four years old. While some of these leaps made me roll my eyes or have to backtrack to figure out 'wait, how did they put that together?!', they didn't ultimately take away from the story for me. Definitely a unique and fast read, one I would highly recommend!"
1379,4.0,"I love it when the type of book you feel like reading is the book you're actually reading! The Last Thing He Told me is an easy to read, fast-paced thriller. One day out of the blue, after her husband fails to come, Hannah receives a note from a little girl at her doorstep. It says, ""Protect Her"". Hannah pretty quickly realises that the note is about her step-daughter Bailey, and that she is the key to solving her husband's whereabouts. Hannah turns her hand to sleuthing, and we follow the twists and turns as she uncovers the secrets in her husband's past. Is this entirely believable? No. Is it fun to read? Yes. Did I expect it to be a little more gripping? Yes ... especially since there's a pretty big 'reveal' towards the end of the book that just wallops you with information and answers after teasing you for so long. All that said, I'm looking forward to seeing the movie from Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine company!"
1380,5.0,"I loved Hannah, the narrator of this domestic suspense. She's a strong independent woman who works as a wood turner, making highly sought after individual pieces of furniture for well-to-do people who are willing to pay for one-of-a-kind pieces that are actually works of art. Hannah loves her work and doesn't meet a man she wants to marry until, when she's thirty eight, Owen walks into her life. Hannah falls in love, leaves her East Coast life behind and starts a new life in Sausalito, California, as Owen's wife and stepmother to his teenage daughter. The news that changes everything comes when a 12 year old in a soccer uniform appears at her front door with a note scribbled in her husband's hand writing. Two words: Protect her. So begins Hannah's struggle to understand and to do what Owen has asked her to do. He's disappeared under questionable circumstances. His boss has been arrested and FBI agents are looking for Owen."
1381,5.0,I really enjoyed this one!! It was a fast read with a slow building mystery. The writing style was great and really drew me in. I also liked the style of bouncing between the present and various parts of the past. Hannah is a recently married woman with a teenage stepdaughter and a husband she loves. One day her husband doesn’t come home and she discovers that the company where his husband works is having legal issues and she can’t reach him. His last words to her guide the direction she goes as she tries to figure out what her husband really had been up to and what secrets he had been hiding from her. 
1382,4.0,"Having been a long time fan of Laura Dave's (Hello Sunshine, 800 Grapes anyone?!), I was definitely curious about her foray into more of a suspenseful novel and I was not disappointed. When Hannah's husband leaves a cryptic note and abandons her and her stepdaughter, the questions begin, and is Owen the man she thought she knew? Told in alternating timelines, we get glimpses of the early courtship between Hannah and Owen as well as the search for Owen. I heard this one is already being adapted for TV and I can't wait to see it come to life."
1383,3.0,Umm. This is a good book just not my kind of book. I guess the stakes just weren’t high enough IMO. 
1384,1.0,Real rating? 0 stars. I was so disappointed by this book.
1385,4.0,"Sometimes I find Reese’s picks to be rather..meh… But, not this one! This was a pleasant surprise! Laura Dave wrote an intriguing story told in both the past and present.  Hannah is married to Owen. They are madly in love and all Hannah wants is to be accepted by Owen’s teenage daughter….(easier said than done- amiright?!) Then the unimaginable happens. Owen disappears. The only thing Hannah and Bailey have left of him is a note delivered to their door saying “protect her.” Without a moments hesitation, Hannah and Bailey begin digging into Owen’s past to try and understand why he would leave such a note. What they uncover is nothing they could’ve ever imagined… and I could not put it down until it all came together!!  This little gem was a mystery and suspense tied together in one nice little package! A quick juicy read I definitely recommend!4-stars!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
1386,5.0,A well done good read.
1387,5.0,"Wow. This book. This BOOK. I did not expect to love this so much. In fact, I almost expected that I wouldn't like it. But I'm so glad I read it. Because everything I expected? Wrong. All of it. This book is absolutely amazing, and I absolutely loved it. I love books that make me cry, because that's how you know you're invested in the story, that you've truly connected to the people in the pages. And this book made me sob. I cried myself to sleep, and still that's not enough tears, because the ending was so much worse than a death. It was a living death. It honestly was. (view spoiler)[The pain they must have felt is incomprehensible. He can never love them again. He's right there, he's alive, they're alive, but they can never be together. And when Hannah said that she hopes he didn't see his daughter. Oh. I'm crying again. Because it's so painful. It hurts because everything he did, he did for his daughter. Because he loves her. Even leaving, he does for her. It's all for her, and yet it hurts him so much. But he does it willingly because of that love. The thing is, he and Nicholas aren't all that different. They both made tough choices, possible bad decisions for their family. For those they love. ""Protect her"". That's all he cares about. (hide spoiler)]All I can say is, read this book. It is incredibly touching, and real, and raw, and painful, but despite that there's a beauty in there that comes from the deep love that connects this beautiful family. I've never read anything quite like this book. In one way or another, this is the deal we all sign when we love someone. For better or worse. It's the deal we have to sign again and again to keep that love. We don't turn away from the parts of someone we don't want to see. However quickly or long it takes to see them. We accept them if we are strong enough. Or we accept them enough not to let the bad parts become the entire story. Because there is this too. The details are not the whole story. The whole story includes this: I love Owen.__________Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. I can't stop crying. Why. Oh my goodness. She called her mom. She called her mom at the end. How can you move on from that. Oh. My. I just. I can't. Without him. That's the greatest sacrifice all of them could possibly make. And then he shows up. And then he leaves. But he still loves her. And I can't stop crying. It wasn't his fault. They're all flawed. No one is perfect. He was just doing the best he could. The best he could for his daughter. Because there's nothing he wouldn't do for her. And he proved it. I can't. I can't stop crying. He loved her so much. So much. How could you make that choice. No one deserves this. I can't. I love this book. But I hate it. It's so good. But so horrible. Ohhh. No. Why. They had so much love. And they still do. Love is what helped him decide to make that sacrifice. And he did it. Without question. Willingly."
1388,5.0,"ok i love thrillers so much, and this is definitely one of my favorite reads of 2021 so far!! i loved this domestic thriller, and i really wasn’t sure the direction it would take. once i started the book, i binged huge sections at a time and stayed up until 3 am one night to finish it. i loved the characters, the plot, and the intensity of what was going on—there were definitely some characters i didn’t trust and for good reasons, which i personally love in thrillers. this was a FANTASTIC book!!"
1389,5.0,"I loved this book so much and raced through it in two days. THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME follows Hannah, whose husband, Owen, disappears, leaving only a note—“Protect her”—and his daughter behind. Now, Hannah must work with her teenage stepdaughter, who has never really warmed to her, to try to discover why Owen has split—and who he really is. This book was so easy to devour, with its quick pace, short chapters, and elegant prose. The mystery is compelling, with a lot of surprising turns and a series of intriguing clues, but the real star of this book is the relationship between Hannah and her stepdaughter Bailey as they’re forced into a situation neither of them could have imagined. I loved watching them grow closer to each other as the story progressed, and I love even more that it never felt forced. The timing of each emotion was spot-on, and you can’t help but root for them along the way. The novel ended in a way I didn’t expect, but it’s so perfect and achingly beautiful that it made me tear up. If you’re looking for a domestic suspense novel with a lot of heart, you can’t do better than this one."
1390,4.0,"I have seen mixed reviews on this one but I really liked it. It is certainly not a happy go lucky story and it doesn’t end the way you hope it will but it kept me engaged, I couldn’t put it down."
1391,5.0,"“How do you explain it when you find in someone what you’ve been waiting for your whole life? Do you call it fate? It feels more like finding your way home - where home is a place you secretly wished for, a place you imagined, but where you’d never been before.”BOOM. Friends I ate this book full up in one sitting!!! The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave is billed as a thriller, and yes it is action packed and keeps you guessing like all good thrillers do. But the depth of this one was special. It felt so much more like women’s fiction with the strong character building, connection, and story. The book follows a woman named Hannah Hall who is coming to grips with the disappearance of her husband in the midst of a stock fraud scandal. He left her an ominous note about keeping his daughter safe and leaves the daughter a duffle bag full of money. Beyond that, radio silence. As Hanna wrestles with the loss of her husband, she searches for answers. The more she digs, the more confused she gets and the more questions she has about who her husband really is. “This is the thing about good and evil. They aren’t so far apart. They often start from the same valiant place of wanting something to be different.”That’s all I can say about the plot without giving things away. But this book is so much more than your average thriller!!! Hannah has to figure out her role as stepmom to a young girl she barely knows. She has to wrestle with what was real in her marriage if everything else about her husband was fake. She has to decide what life she wants to live going forward and what she’s willing to give up to do it. The Last Thing He Told Me is really a story about love, loss and what it means to be a family. So well done!!To read more reviews, head over TO MY BLOG.Or see what I'm currently reading over on my INSTAGRAM PAGE. And now you can even follow my book chats on my BOOKTUBE CHANNEL! "
1392,5.0,"After Hannah’s husband disappears, leaving her with his 16 year old daughter, Bailey, she starts to hear terrible things about him being involved in a scandal at work. But she knows her husband and knows that he would not only never do that, but also never willingly leave his daughter. In order to prove that everything she knows about her life is not a lie, she sets out with Bailey to investigate and find the truth. This thriller is so good and has its own unique twists. Hannah is a strong, determined and loving woman, with a massive amount of conviction. She’s a woman who steps up to the plate to support, love, and help the step-daughter who has never liked her. The brevity and simplicity of the writing is what makes so much of the story so beautiful. Highly recommended for fellow lovers of thrillers, family dramas, and for those of us who are looking for a unique and refreshing story. "
1393,3.0,"It's so hard to write a review for a book that had me tearing through the pages but also kind of ended up being just ""meh"". While I would have never guessed the reason Owen left a bag of cash, his daughter, and wife behind it still wasn't this huge OMG-worthy moment to me. Plus, the way it was revealed to readers as Hannah was still trying to piece everything together was a little bit of let down since I thought the author was doing a fantastic job of building up Owen's past. It just felt very anticlimactic to reveal it so quickly.With that being said though I still did absolutely fly through this and when I wasn't reading it I was trying to think up scenarios of why Owen would do what he did. I also really enjoyed the relationship between Hannah and Bailey and how much we see it grow over the span of such a short book. Hands down that was definitely my favorite part of this story."
1394,4.0,"Officially landing on four stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟The Last Thing He Told Me was the June selection for our little book club. For me, it was an overall good read that moved at a quick pace.Hannah is left in total shock and confusion when her husband, Owen, suddenly disappears without warning. Suddenly Hannah and Bailey (Hannah’s stepdaughter/Owen’s daughter) are thrown into a situation where they must solve this mystery of a puzzle with only a couple of pieces. The pressure is intensified by the tense relationship between Hannah and Bailey… sixteen-year-old Bailey wasn’t exactly thrilled to begin with at having Hannah as her stepmother. Now with Owen missing, the stress takes on a new level. I enjoyed the plot of this book and how quickly it moved. There were pieces of the story that felt open-ended and parts that made me go 🤔 but, as a whole, it was a fun summer read!"
1395,4.0,"I devoured this beautifully written and HUGELY addictive novel in one sitting- it is absolutely one of those books that pringles like, once you pop, you can’t stop.Hannah is happily married to Owen, the only slight hiccup being her seeming inability to connect with her stepdaughter. But then Owen goes missing…leaving behind only the words “Protect Her”…After that you are hook line and sinkered as the author takes you on a twisty path towards the truth. Perfectly set and cleverly layered this is one of those unpredictable stories that doesnt disappoint with its final denouement.I loved it. Definitely one of the best psychological drama’s you’ll read this year.Highly recommended."
1396,5.0,"The Last Thing He Told Me was a great read, and congrats to @lauradaveauthor for being chosen as the @reesesbookclub May pick in 2021!I loved the short, page-turning chapters, and the dual timeline leading up to the mystery behind Owen’s strange disappearance. I also really connected to Hannah as she tries to sort everything out while also trying to bind with her teenage step-daughter.*many thanks to the publisher for the gifted copy for review. All opinions are my own"
1397,1.0,"Slow, repetitive, and ridiculously unrealistic, I know I am in the minority but I don't get why this book is so popular."
1398,5.0,The story is so well crafted. Bonus if you're a step- parent. You'll appreciate the characters. I couldn't put it down.
1399,1.0,I gave up because I was bored.
1400,1.0,"High key annoyed. This book made no sense and it was repetitive as anything. The plot made me lose several dozen brain cells. I can't even call this a thriller since as many pointed out this was more of a domestic drama. I could see this book getting some play via Lifetime or Netflix and we all would be screaming at the character of Hannah for not making any sense. ""The Last Thing He Told Me"" follows 40 year old Hannah Hall. Hannah we find is married to Owen. Owen has a daughter named Bailey from his first marriage. Hannah gets a note from her husband saying ""Protect her."" and Hannah realizes that she needs to protect Bailey. From there the book follows the mysteries of Owen and what exactly Hannah needs to protect Bailey from. Hannah drove me up the wall. She keeps doing really dumb things and keeps excusing every thing that Owen does and nope, just nope. I also never got a sense of them as a couple. Dave decides to showcase Hannah and Owen's relationship in little vignettes that don't help anything. It doesn't help that we keep hearing how Hannah's mother abandoned her (it's weird the father was just excused) so that means she has to stick with Bailey. Lord. I was tired of it. Hannah needed therapy. The secondary characters except for Bailey don't really work IMHO. Bailey felt real and her reactions were realistic. Maybe if the story had been told from her point of view the book would have worked better. The writing was not great in a lot of places. Others mentioned grammatical mistakes that I found too. Also the book see-saws between the present and whatever past thing/action she had with her and Owen. So you would get a chapter in present day with Hannah ""investigating"" and then it would jump back and have her remembering her and Owen drinking on their little porch or whatever. Those chapters did not help anything. I think what gets me is how terrible the plot got. We start off with a missing father and it looks like it's tied to a financial scandal and then Dave throws something else out and it didn't need it. As some readers said, the first part of the book was interesting with Owen missing. But once we had Hannah turn into super detective the whole book got old quick. The flow was awful. I think everything happened in like a week time period. The setting of California and Texas didn't feel real to me at all. I think Dave was too focused on what people looked like and didn't really think of how both states/cities sounded and felt the same. At least they did to me while reading. The epilogue made me shake my head. I called BS on that whole ending since it didn't even sound realistic even a little bit. "
1401,4.0,"The Last Thing He Told Me is a riveting and enthralling mystery thriller about the disappearance of a devoted husband and father inspired by the Enron scandal. Hannah Hall believes she has finally found her soulmate in husband of one year Owen Michaels and they live a seemingly happy life. Hannah is a craftswoman who makes handmade furniture for elite clientele. Together they live on a beautiful houseboat in Sausalito in Marin County, California alongside Owen's 16-year-old daughter Bailey, who is far from overjoyed with her father's new wife/ her stepmother. A computer coder for a prominent and successful technology start-up known as The Shop, Owen vanishes just before the company's CEO is arrested and taken into custody by the FBI after a year-long investigation into suspected fraud and corruption. They had apparently put some new software on the market way before it was fully functional and then cooked the books when it came to their finances. Both Hannah and Bailey are in total shock but before he skedaddled he left a note written to his wife with the words ""protect her"", delivered to them by a neighbourhood teen. She knows it refers to Bailey as she lost her mother tragically when she was young. The message is a simple one but Hannah knows she must find out what Bailey needs protection from and her motherly instincts kick into high gear. So amidst the fear, confusion and worry they know they must stick together. Bailey soon discovers that her father has left her over half a million dollars in cash bundled into a bag and placed into her locker at school.She tries everything to contact him but to no avail and refuses to believe her husband, the man she thought she knew inside and out, was involved in serious criminal activity so when a US marshal and federal agents arrive at her Sausalito home unannounced Hannah realises what she believes about Owen is in direct opposition to what the world is trying to tell her. Convinced of his innocence Hannah and Bailey work tirelessly to uncover what it was that made Owen run, where he is and if he's ever coming back. Their search leads them to Texas even though Owen had claimed when they had first met he was from the East Coast. As they decipher the clues and go deeper down the rabbit hole, they both realise that there is no Owen Michaels, he was merely a character played by a man with another name. Devastated Hannah and Bailey discover that the one good thing to come from this hideous betrayal is the close bond they now have with one another. This is a compulsive and enthralling thriller with a real mystery at its centre and not only does the author place many blindsiding plot twists and dizzying red herrings within the pages but her characters, namely Hannah and Bailey, are emotional and compelling too. It's a blisteringly paced, evocative domestic drama and you can't help but feel heartbroken for those left behind. Alternating between past and present, with suspense and tension in abundance and a poignancy about it, The Last Thing He Told Me asks the question: What happens when we trust the people in our lives despite all evidence to the contrary?"
1402,4.0,"I have been seeing a lot of love for The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave and now I can see why! This is a slow-burn mystery of where Hannah's husband has disappeared to, and I love that it sent her on a sleuthing expedition to Austin, Texas with her stepdaughter Bailey. Even though I consider it a slow burn, it is still quite pacy and didn't feel slow when I was reading it. I was fully invested in finding out what happened to Owen, and what she finds completely surprised me. Hannah was a bit of a badass, and I really loved her as a character and that the whole book is told from her perspective. Dave really brought the setting to life through her writing, and I could picture Austin as clear as day while Hannah and Bailey are there poking around trying to figure Owen out. I also thought it was great that there are two different timelines in the novel - one is in the past and talks about Owen and Hannah's relationship, and then of course present time after he disappears. Through the past timeline, we also get to see how Bailey and Hannah interacted, and it was nice to see how their relationship evolved throughout the novel.The audiobook for The Last Thing He Told Me was also fantastic and narrated by Rebecca Lowman. I have actually listened to this narrator before and think she is really great at what she does. She was the perfect person to voice this book, and she really brought the characters and story to life for me in the way that only a very talented narrator can when mixed with a great writer. I think she also kept me even more interested in the story, and I would definitely listen to the audiobook if you like reading books with your ears. I was pretty shocked at how the novel ended which was great, and I especially loved all the different title chapters that Dave came up with. This was my first time experiencing her writing but will definitely not be my last as I loved it. It flowed so well and was perfectly descriptive without being overly descriptive to the point that I couldn't get into it. The very end made my heart squeeze a little, and some readers will definitely consider it to be a tearjerker. This was such an enjoyable and engaging read and I can't wait to read more from Dave!I received an advanced listening copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
1403,4.0,"Straight up -- I didn't agree with the pre-publishing hype that promoted this book as a “thriller.” In my opinion, it falls more into the category of a domestic mystery/suspense. It was less thrilling than I anticipated with a slow-moving pace, but still an entertaining afternoon of reading from a new-to-me-author. I’m hearing bits and pieces of hoopla about an AppleTV series based upon Dave’s book and starring Julia Roberts as Hannah.
PROTECT HER.
A husband suddenly vanishes – leaving behind a note asking his wife of only one year to take care of his sixteen-year-old daughter. The police, FBI and a “friendly” US Marshal are all involved. Hannah just wants to find her husband and get some answers. Along with Bailey, her step-daughter, with whom she shares a strained relationship, the two begin a cross-country journey on their own to find the truth and hopefully the missing person. Their search is suspenseful and a bit calamitous while exploring the growing bond between this unlikely pair. I’m hesitant to say more – I don’t want to give anything away. For me, the ending was the major disappointment with too many remaining questions running wildly through my thoughts (a one-star reduction). I detest these types of endings – but a worthwhile read if you can deal with the lackluster ending!I certainly don’t want to give the impression that this was a bad read for me because it wasn’t. I just think it had much more potential than was tapped. What I did find very appealing was the author’s writing that flowed effortlessly and was easy to read and absorb, the build-up moving the story forward was exciting and overall, the plot kept me involved. In a strongly character-driven storyline, these characters were remarkably intriguing and solidly developed. No grouchy remarks in this regard.And it appears that hope might spring eternal with an added bit of info from the author, who told Popsugar, ""As for the future of the book? I know exactly where I would pick up with Hannah, Owen, and Bailey—and I love the idea of imagining their next chapter."" I certainly could get onboard with that thought. I would love to see a follow-up continuing this story to a complete resolution. "

1405,2.0,"This book just fell flat for me. Of course, the premise was intriguing - a woman’s husband disappears one day, leaving behind some puzzling last words and she has to piece together the truth of the man she married but doesn’t really know. I just wasn’t convinced of the relationship between Hannah and Owen, or Hannah and Bailey. I actually thought that Hannah came off as arrogant and a bit pompous and it’s hard to get into a book if you dislike the main character. Spoilers below:Throughout the book there just wasn’t enough of Hannah herself as a person to get a clear look into her character. So for her to take the huge step of agreeing to cut Owen out of her life just for Bailey’s sake, essentially becoming Bailey’s “mom,” seemed unbelievable to me. The reveal of Owen’s true backstory and the reason he left Texas felt just thrown in there and killed the momentum of the book. It seemed ridiculous to me that if you were trying to stay in hiding from dangerous people, you would take such a prominent job and take part in something illegal and shady — WHICH IS WHY YOU HAD TO RUN AWAY IN THE FIRST PLACE. Did Owen not learn anything??? That was so frustrating. The story kept alluding to his father-in-law’s “people he works for” - why not just come out with more detail? Hannah‘s entire time at his estate and conversation with him in his office didn’t build up any feeling of dread or anxiety for me at all. After that, everything felt predictable. Of course Bailey was going to accept her as her mother. Of course Owen would try to get in touch discreetly. Once I saw the title for the last chapter, I thought, that’s it? A disappointing read."
1406,3.0,"Meh. This book fell flat & I’ll probably forget about it, which isn’t to say others won’t enjoy it. The writing was a quick read, but overall it just felt blah.I will briefly state right from the get-go that I thought Hannah was about as exciting as a plain rice cake. With a few exceptions (I did enjoy learning about her wood-making talent), nothing about her character was interesting. She gave off a very holier-than-thou attitude with regards to her being a great stepmom who will never make Bailey do anything she doesn’t want to do. She gives her space, let’s her say nasty things to her, let’s her do whatever she wants, etc and we hear about it c o n s t a n t l y. I appreciated how their relationship grew (& the last line of the book was truly great), but I really would have enjoyed something from Baileys point of view. Or Owens. Or Nicks. Literally any other character. The events that led them to Texas had so much potential yet when all of the secrets were revealed it was such a letdown because again... not all that interesting. I don’t even know how else to describe it other than I said “Really? That’s it?” when it all came together. I think approximately one million characters throughout the course of the book told Hannah “If you only knew what your husband did/is like” AND THEN NEVER FOLLOWS UP ON IT. Was he a good guy? A bad guy? Who the hell knows? Not me, that’s who. So much hype and not enough payoff."
1407,5.0,"Thank you Booksparks for gifting me a copy of The Last Thing He Told Me!Genre: MysteryPub Date: 5.4.21Star Rating: ☆☆☆☆☆ “That’s how you fill in the blanks — with stories and memories of the people who love you. If they lie to you, who are you then?.. The person you thought you knew, your favorite person starts to disappear, a mirage, unless you convince yourself the parts that matter are still true.” I finished this book in less than 12 hours. I started reading it before dinner last night and had to force myself to put it down. I couldn’t wait to get back to reading it this morning because it was just addicting. I don’t know if it’s the author’s writing style, the story, or the characters but I was hooked by it all. I wanted to know the whole story and loved the way the author pieced together information from Hannah’s flashbacks with Owen.📖 Short chapters⏪ Flashbacks🕵🏽‍♀️ Independent detective work🧩 Felt like I was assembling the pieces of a puzzle🤯 That ending.I see why Reeses Book Club and Book of the Month picked this novel for their May pick. You have to add this to your summer reading list. It’s addicting, mysterious, and overall a wild ride of emotions. It will keep you reading until you’ve read the very last page and, if you’re like me, you’re going to still want more."
1408,5.0,"I absolutely loved The Last Thing He Told Me by Laura Dave. I was utterly entranced with the story, and enchanted by the writing and thought-provoking narrative. This story gripped my attention from the first page to the last, made me think, moved me to tears, and left me with that satisfied feeling of having been gifted with a genuinely great story, crafted by a true storyteller. The plot begins with the soon-to-be scandal and disappearance of Owen Michael. And on the day he vanishes, he leaves Hannah, his wife of a year, a note imploring her to “Protect Her”. Hannah, presumes this means Owen’s recalcitrant 16-year old daughter, Bailey. As the scandal unleashes, the mystery increases, and Hannah realizes that Owen has a secret past that is vastly different from what she’d been told. With a federal marshal trying to convince them of one story and plan, Hannah and Bailey team up and insist on finding answers for themselves, because they no longer know who to believe. What they find is far more shocking than what they bargained for.This story is intelligent, clever and clearly expressed. It’s got a depth to it that is surprising in a mystery/thriller, particularly a fast-paced one. It’s insightful, thoughtful and impactful and will long stay with me."
1409,5.0,"❤️❤️ Love love love ❤️ ❤️From the very beginning, I was totally engrossed and absorbed in this thriller. The setting is Sausalito, a beautiful, small and artsy village just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, that I’ve personally been to and loved, and where WHO wouldn’t want to live! They of course live right on the water. It’s about a newly married couple, Hannah and Owen, which results in a small, family as Hannah becomes stepmom to the brooding teenage daughter of Owen. (I know how hard it is being the stepmom and can’t imagine starting off with an older teen.) Here comes the suspense and thrills….husband Owen disappears and leaves a note saying “Protect Her”. So well written as it develops the characters and their relationships, along with the mystery about Owen. It is about adjustments, relationships, untruths, uncovering, lies and deceit, changes and brightness. Depends on your outlook. Loved it. For so many reasons. Mostly for the strong women who wouldn’t back down. For the honest people who supported them. Amen"
1410,4.0,This newest book by Laura Dave was pretty good and had me guessing all the way until the end how it was going to end. I wasn’t thrilled with the ending but I did enjoy the characters in the story. Thanks to NetGalley and the Publisher for this early release in exchange for my honest review. To be published May 2021.
1411,1.0,"What is happening. I am thinking someone must have bound the cover to the book everyone is loving to whatever nuisancework I found inside. I hate to do this, knowing the love and time that goes into a book, but this is hands down one of the worst books I've read in a long time, worsened only by the fact that there seems to be a glitch in my simulation of reality so that others are raving about it.I can't even trouble myself to delve as deeply as I'd have to to highlight all of the ways that this novel went wrong, but suffice it to say that there is absolutely zero character development or character consistency, enough repetition to be used as a kind of government torture, no writer-reader trust whatsoever, absurd levels of implausibility, and descriptions that are, for at least some entertainment value, ridiculous and farcical.Nope."
1412,1.0,"Sigh.Why is it then I keep getting hooked on samples that seems so promising, at least “four-star review” promising, and finding I’m stuck with a “one to two-star” book, time and time again?The protagonist isn’t very likable. The romance wasn’t very believable. The relationship forged with the stepdaughter didn’t seem authentic and the resolution seemed ridiculous at best. Not to mention the plot, itself. A million dollars left and given back then no more mention of it? The husband’s dead first wife and manner of her death? You’re trying to tell me that the husband had no idea it could’ve resulted from something else she was involved in?I’ve wasted too much time on this as it is. Don’t fall for it. This book isn’t worth the buzz. "
1413,5.0,"The ride that this story takes you on is AMAZING! I couldn't put it down. Laura Dave did a fantastic job of world and character building in a way that let me see this play out as a movie as I read it. Watching these characters make the choices they did as they saw how far they would go for those they love, and themselves.The twists and mystery behind why Owen ran leaving you not only guessing but as truths come to light show how you really never know why a person makes the choices they make. I also really enjoyed seeing Hannah and Bailey's relationship evolve as they truly had to count on each other. If you love a good mystery that moves at the perfect pace then this is for you!*Arc generously provided for honest review"
1414,2.0,"When I first read the description of this book, I was really excited. I LOVE mystery/suspense books and thought this one was right up my alley. Unfortunately I was dissapointed in the writing. This is my first Laura Dave book, and while I thought the premise was intriguing, and the cover caught my eye, it lacked the suspense and twists that I look for in my reads. The dissapearance of Hannah's husband, and the growing relationship between Hannah and her step-daughter Bailey all seemed too predictable, and failed to surprise or intrigue me while I read.Thanks to NetGalley and Simon Schuster for my ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review."
1415,5.0,"The Last Thing He Told Me is a slow burning mystery held together by great character development. I was fully invested in Hannah and Bailey's lives, and eager to find out what would happen to them after the sudden disappearance of Owen (Hannah's husband and Bailey's father). Believe me, it's not what you think. I love a domestic suspense that can pull off a great surprise and Laura Dave did just that. I have mixed feeling about the end, but I love a book that keeps me thinking long after the last page is turned."
1416,3.0,When Hannah receives a note from her husband Owen saying take care of her... her whole world turns upside down. As Hannah and her step daughter try to figure out what happened to Owen and why he has gone missing. Things in their life start to resurface and things that Hannah thought made sense start to make her question if she ever really knew her husband. I found most of the book interesting but kind of lost interest towards the end. I wanted more of an exciting ending then what it was so I give this a C+
1417,5.0,AMAZING book! Teared up a tad at the end. It couldn’t have ended any other way tho. I literally just could not stop reading this book! After a few books back to back taking a month to read this one was just that good it took me two days👌 SO GOOD! READ IT!!
1418,2.0,You know you're not enjoying a book when you just want it to be over already and don't care anymore. That was this one for me.
1419,1.0,I’m not really sure why this is considered a thriller? Nothing thrilling about it. This book was disappointing and anticlimactic… 
1420,3.0,"I'd give credit for the awesome characterization and emotional growth shown throughout the book. That was Neat. Plot though on contrary seemed like could have been done better. At times It's boring and predictable and yawn inducing. I almost decided to dnf it, ykw when You've a lot in your physical tbr and in form of ebook & audiobook to choose from, wasting precious time over a book like this most likely is an act of unwise. But again I'm a certified fool, so i decided to read till the end! Was it okay? Well to be fair the ending did compensate a bit for the boring mid part . So I'm not complaining too much. But Here's the deal breaker for me! Writing style. The consequences weren’t too far fetched but it wasn’t executed properly. I Won't say It's surreal and author faked the fact. But with such little information and little Detective skill and effort, how they reached to the conclusion did not feel believable either. All in all everything remained like some plot devices rather than the organic development foreshadowing the ending a bit forced. A rating of 3 stars rounded up! Anyway Preferences are subjective. So it did not worked for me that Doesn't mean it Won't for you too. Go give it a try if You're looking for a light thriller packed with familial bondings.

Well, you try to find the truth about you're husband in a mysterious adventure that will leave the reader rooting for you and your family. This story was intriguing and very family orientated, it demonstrates the importance of family but most importantly the growing love between a step-mother and her newly acquired daughter. I had a wonderful time reading this story and I will be looking out for more of Laura Dave's works in the future.Thank you NetGalley and Laura Dave for the arc"
1422,5.0,"How well do you know the man you married? This book starts with a woman who's husband didn't come home from work one day. All she get's is a hand written note saying Protect her. She knows who he's talking about, his daughter from his first marriage, a sullen teenager who's good at being her age. Twists, turns, and a discussion of what it means to be a family. To be a mother. I loved it. "
1423,2.0,It’s a whirlwind mystery with a touch of tension. It’s addictive in the beginning and then just becomes so far fetched it’s ridiculous. Which is fine if the characters are developed enough to hold it. Maybe my hopes for this story were too strong it’s a 2 star for me. 
1424,4.0,"A solid four stars. This book was hard to put down and a quick read. I took one star away because there were some questions I never got answers to. Overall a great mystery, though!"
1426,4.0,If your looking for a fun fast read this is for you.
1427,4.0,"I loved this book so much. it was incredibly exciting, touching and beautifully written! I could not put it down. I had to know what happened next. I did not like the ending tho, but then I actually liked it a little, then I hated it, then it was all right – then I started crying from the last word that was said. a beautiful book with other words."
1428,4.0,"3.8 ⭐Stvarno je dobro napisana knjiga. Spororazvijajuća priča koja u fokusu ima likove, ne sam zločin. Strahovito mi se dopala Hana i stvarno je morala da napravi mnogo teške izbore. Ali kraj mi je nekako nezadovoljavajuć (za moj ukus)."
1429,5.0,I couldn't put this down. Such a good story. I was intrigued from the beginning. It played out in a way that I didn't guess. I loved it! Read in less than 24 hours
1430,5.0,"Super fast read, unputdownable. I flew through it in the best way. The reviews seem mixed but I loved this one. I loved the characters. The story was intriguing. Really loved this one and recommend it!"
1431,2.0,The protagonist in this drama (not thriller) was not well developed by the author…she was extremely one dimensional. The author began with a good concept but midway the book lost it’s thrust and the second half was choppy. It was an easy read but I am baffled by the mass popularity this title is experiencing.

1433,3.0,"While it didn’t add anything new to the thriller genre, it was incredibly enjoyable and very easy to read. I like Laura Dave’s writing style and would definitely pick up other thrillers she writes."
1434,5.0,"This one was a 4.5 for me. It had me hooked from beginning to end and I didn’t want to put it down. The chapter names were a little creative bonus too! I was a bit over Reese’s bookclub picks but I’m so thankful I gave this one a read, she may be redeeming herself with this pick! "
1435,5.0,Loved this book. A nice blend of women's fiction and page-turning suspense. What sets this apart is the realistic relationship between a new mother and her teenage step-daughter. They grow closer as they try to unravel the mystery behind why her husband chose to disappear. Has one of the best last sentences of a book ever. Highly recommend if you like a character driven story with lots of twists.
1437,3.0,"Hannah Hall's husband of just over one year has disappeared leaving behind a plea for her to protect his teenage daughter with whom Hannah has had trouble establishing a relationship. So begins a quest to find him and try to determine why he has left them. Along the way Hannah and her step-daughter uncover many things about the man they both love, things that shatter their notions of who he is. Although this is a very well-written and interesting story, I found the pace to be bit on the slow side. I was invested in the story though and wanted to learn the answers to all the questions raised in the first third of the book. Hannah was a resourceful and determined character and I was quite fascinated by her occupation as a woodturner. As always, I'm very impressed when an author titles each chapter. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to a friend and look forward to reading another book by Laura Dave in the future.Many thanks to Netgalley and Simon & Schuster Canada for the opportunity to read The Last Thing He Told Me prior to publication."
1438,2.0,"A mediocre thriller that showed initial signs of great promise but then quickly crumbled. Hannah is yet another misguided female heroine who is empowered to act on her instinct but never in her own story. This story is about “the last thing” HE told her. This is unfortunate because Hannah really grows into her own over the course of the novel, but is still saddled to the misgivings of a man she never really knew. Dave’s weaving of Hannah’s past life living without a mother and under the tutelage of her grandfather reads like it was added into a later stage draft of the book. Choppy and under-developed. "
1439,2.0,"Loved the characterization and family drama. Could have been a well done mystery but what I can’t get over is if he really loved his daughter so much and wanted to protect her, why would he just take off without her? If his photos would have ended up in the media, the gangster people could have still tracked his daughter/wife down and killed them to hurt him. Leaving Bailey back to protect her makes no sense. If anything, he abandoned her. Is it just me or that’s too big of a loophole? "
1440,5.0,"Even though this is not my typical genre, I loved this book from the first page, till its very last sentence. I may be biased here though, as being raised by a single parent made it pretty easy for me to relate to the storyline. However, even without that personal imprint, I believe that the story is pretty universal, told in a smart way, and, what I found particularly important, feels real (especially the ending. I know I am in the minority here though). I strongly recommend it!"
1441,5.0,"Great book. Will leave you wondering what YOU would do, and the sacrifices you'd make for those you love. The last line says it all. Brava to the author for capturing family and suspense in one awesome read."

They aren't so far apart -- and they often start from the same valiant place of wanting something to be different...at the end of the day, one thing defines them.""Hannah Hall has been married to Owen Michaels for little over a year when he suddenly disappears leaving Hannah with his 16-year-old daughter, Bailey. There are rumors of malfeasance at Owen's place of work and his boss has been arrested by the FBI.

When Bailey finds a duffel bag stuffed with cash in her school locker, they understand that something terrible has happened. It seems that both of them know very little about Owen and soon realize that they need to solve the puzzle so they can rebuild their lives. NO SPOILERS.This was fast and fun and I read it over a couple of hours. The narrative pulls the reader in and it was hard to put it down. The mystery and drama were compelling and I did a lot of guessing while flipping the pages! I can't say that I would have reacted as Hannah did, but I did like her as a character. The relationship between Hannah and Bailey was an integral part of the story and their desire to get at the truth bonded them together. The pair is resourceful and determined and soon discovers what it means to be involved in a life that is one huge lie.Thank you to NetGalley and Simon & Schuster for this e-book ARC to read, review, and recommend. It screams out for movie adaptation so don't be surprised when it's optioned since some famous names have been touting it."
1446,4.0,"A quick page-turner, The Last Thing He Told Me is an excellent way to spend an afternoon. It reminded me of John Grisham’s The Fugitive or Scott Turow’s Presumed Innocent, but without the murder-mystery part, and, like the aforementioned, would make a great movie.Hannah, an artist living on a beautiful houseboat in the San Francisco area, opens the door one day to a young woman with a note in her husband Owen’s handwriting that reads simply, “Protect her”. Hannah instinctively knows that the only “her” being referred to is her stepdaughter Bailey, Owen’s teenager daughter who is not exactly Hannah’s biggest fan. But that is all Hannah knows. She begins to question who Owen really is and if she really knows him at all. And Hannah and Bailey embark on dangerous quest to dig into Owen’s past to find the answers they seek, as well as the man they both love.A recommended read, The Last Thing He Told Me was also big hit with the book club circuit, being selected by such heavy-hitters as Book of the Month Club and Reese’s Book Club.A big thank you to Laura Dave, Simon & Schuster, and NetGalley for providing an Advanced Reader Copy in exchange for this review.Want to give The Last Thing He Told Me a read?

1448,3.0,"Such a mediocre novel :| despite all the noise and talikng about how wonderful this book is, I found its story so simple and just a muxture of some of the novels I already read through the years."
1449,4.0,Good not great. Interesting and enjoyable but probably won’t be too memorable.
1450,3.0,It’s a good domestic thriller. A little slow though. Well-written.
1451,4.0,4 Stars- I liked the writing and the character development. Some parts were pretty slow and some went way too fast. Overall I enjoyed it. 
1452,4.0,"Enjoyable and Easy to Read Domestic DramaSUMMARYOwen Michael’s has disappeared. Before he left, he managed to smuggle a single note with two words to his wife, Hannah. The note reads ‘protect her.’ Despite Hannah’s confusion about his disappearance, she knows exactly who Owen was referring to in the note. It’s His sixteen-year-old daughter, Bailey, who had tragically lost her mother as a child. On the day of Owen's disappearance, Bailey finds a large duffel bag full of money in her school locker. As the reality that Owen has left them sets in, Hannah doesn’t know exactly what that note means. Protect Bailey from whom and why does she even need protection. Where did that money come from, and where is Owen? When Owen’s boss is arrested for securities fraud and the FBI and US Marshalls show up on Hannah’s doorstep in Sausalito, she realizes that Owen isn’t who he says he was. Hannah and Bailey set out to discover the truth about Owen’s past. REVIEWTHE LAST THING HE TOLD HER is an enjoyable and easy-to-read domestic drama. The writing by Author Laura Dave is nicely plotted and full of shifts back and forth in time. Hannah narrates the story, much of which is derived either from her thought process or her strained relationship with her snarky stepdaughter. I’m sure we all remember when we were sixteen and we thought our parents were total losers. Dave nailed Hannah’s frustrating relationship with Bailey to the wall. Hannah, the ‘evil’ stepmom cannot do anything right. You may initially want to reach through the pages and give Bailey a good shake for her endless litany of snarky comments. Hannah’s character is strong, intelligent, and brave. When the worst thing in her life happens, she doesn’t sit still and worry; she does something. She goes in search of the truth. I listened to the audiobook for THE LAST THING HE TOLD HER narrated by Rebecca Lowman. Her voice fits the book perfectly and easily transports us into the story from the houseboat in Sausalito to Hannah and Bailey’s travel to Austin, Texas.Publisher Simon Schuster Audio Published May 4, 2021Narrated Rebecca LowmanReview www.bluestockingreviews.com"
1453,5.0,"Just wow! Couldn’t put it down. Loved all the characters and especially Hannah who’s a smart, independent, worthy character. Quite a change from the way women are portrayed in many other books. Cried several times throughout but especially at the end. No spoilers. Just felt moved and it’s been awhile since a book has made me feel that way. Can’t wait for the movie or miniseries. Thanks, Reese!"
1454,4.0,listened to this one.
1455,4.0,"So overall I give this a 4. My main problem was the daughter,maybe since i have 2 teenagers i didn't really read about a moody disrespectful teenager? It was an easy read but also easy for me to put down."
1456,2.0,"Thank you to NetGalley for an ARC of 
The Last Thing He told Me.
 ** Minor spoilers ahead ** When Hannah's husband, Owen, flees from the authorities when his company is charged with fraud, leaving his daughter behind, Hannah knows it is for a good reason. Owen adored Bailey and would do anything for her. Anything.But, when she discover her husband is not who he is, reflecting back on the past when he misspoke or misstated something about his life, Hannah, with Bailey reluctantly in tow, decide to do a little investigating of their own.Is Hannah ready to face the truth behind her husband and what this may mean for her flailing relationship with a stepdaughter who refuses to accept her?The premise is not new; a woman marries a man after a short courtship but later finds out he is not who he is supposed to be.The narrative starts dramatically, suspenseful, as Hannah discovers Owen's lies and begins to piece his past together with the little she knows about him.I enjoyed following Hannah and Bailey's journey in Texas, digging for clues, interviewing people who may or may not be able to help them.Personally, the narrative turned a bit soapy for me; it was so soapy I could have bathed twice over, after discovering who Owen really is, why he did what he did to protect Bailey, and how Hannah bargained for the life of her stepdaughter.The selling point of the story is Hannah and Bailey's relationship; their growing bond as stepdaughter and stepmom, Bailey slowly beginning to understand and accept Hannah's help and her desire to protect and love her as a daughter.The writing was good, and I liked Hannah and Bailey; they were sympathetic and likable characters.The story was just okay for me, but some readers will really love this."
1457,2.0,"Oh the irony. Where should we start.... Let's start by the writing. Which was the main problem of this book. Bad, simplistic.It reminded me of those villains in soap operas when they start to repeat and use some words so they can seem more dangerous and creepy than they actual are. But you know that they're actually just rich people with rich people's problems. And that's what this whole book tries to do with you: it tries to create this whole atmosphere and situation where the author wants you to feel like you're being chased and there's this whole big creepy mystery going on behind the curtains, but it's just a kinda underwhelming situation thrown at your face. To be quite honest I quite enjoyed the beginning and the whole Clue spiel of you trying to figure out tiny pieces of the puzzle to achieve the whole picture. But by the 78% mark everything is revealed out of nowhere. Like truly thrown at your face with HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. THIS IS THIS AND THAT IS THAT. And the whole book could've have ended there. Because after that, the book really transformed into a soap opera.A bad Mexican soap opera to be quite specific. Overall this was a fast and entertaining read that should have been edited way more so I wouldnt feel this bitter taste in my mouth that I'm feeling right now."
1458,4.0,"An interesting story that explores how well we know someone, even someone we’re married to, someone we love. Here, two professional people meet, fall in love and end up happily married. He’s been married before, but his wife died in an accident, and he’s been living a happy life with his daughter, someone who’s none too happy to have to deal with a new Mom. The husband works for a company that’s developed cutting age security technology, and on the day the CEO is arrested for artificially inflating the stock price, the husband disappears, sending a note to his wife to protect his daughter. Surely this is just a big mistake, some misunderstanding. She believes he’s going to walk through the door any minute to tell her he’s innocent of any wrong doing and explain what’s really going on. But as time goes by, with no word, she decides to take matters into her own hands and solve the mystery of her missing husband. And what an unexpected rabbit hole it turns out to be! A quick and engaging page turner!"
1459,4.0,"I approached “The Last Thing He Told Me”, by Laura Dave, cautiously, because I did not like Reese’s pick “Where the Crawdad’s Sing” (I thought it was utterly preposterous from beginning to end.) But I received a copy of Laura Dave’s domestic mystery from a friend, and fellow University of Texas alumna, who thought I’d enjoy the Austin setting. She was right!The plot is simple: Hannah’s husband Owen has disappeared leaving her and her snotty/surly sixteen year old step-daughter, Bailey, to find answers on their own.I found the novel extremely compelling, finishing it in one day. I can see why the film/series rights have been snapped up as it is exactly the kind of thriller that translates easily to a screenplay. So I’ll be more open-minded to Reese’s picks in the future."
1460,4.0,"This was a very quick read.The beginning drew me in instantly and I was immediately intrigued. The plot goes heavy straight away, and we find out Owen is somehow involved in fraud/embezzlement at his company.Add to the drama a moody teenager in Bailey and I was in! This reminded me a little of my relationship with my stepmum too and definitely gave me an affinity with her!The plot concerning the embezzlement was a little complicated at times, and felt a little like Dave had thrown a lot of the excitement of the book in the first few chapters, but then it went up a gear again!An enjoyable thriller."
1461,4.0,"Any book that I read cover to cover in one afternoon is a winner to me!The Last Thing He Told Me is the perfect suspenseful novel. Full of family drama, mystery and written with perfect pacing, this is just the adventure to sit with for a few hours.Owen has disappeared with no notice sending his wife Hannah a note saying “protect her” and leaving a bag with money in his daughter’s locker. What ensues is Hannah’s journey to find out what exactly happened to Owen and why he is hiding, while also taking care of her stepdaughter Bailey.4.5 stars"
1462,2.0,"Reese Witherspoon seems to select books that can be turned into movies in which she can star. Unfortunately, she likes domestic drama more than I do. This wasn’t for me. I received a free copy of this book from the publisher. "
1463,3.0,"A good, breezy sorbet that was easily read in a few hours. "
1464,1.0,Far fetched and over rated. “Protect her”… protect my friends from reading this stupid book!!!
1465,3.0,"A lying father, a wimpy step-mother and a horrendously obnoxious 16 year old daughter - what more could you ask for in a plot? A lot. Every page was an “Aw, c’mon” moment! Just one too many coincidences - none of the happenings were even feasible!Were Bailey and Professor Cookman elephants? They had astounding memories! I like a story to be vaguely possible, this one was not, but I gobbled it up regardless. Bailey was such a hateful character that I can’t imagine why anyone would have wanted her. Both Owen and Hannah let her get away with murder - I would have grounded her until she was 21. Smart mouthed spoiled brat👎The ending was rather anticlimactic. I’ll read more by this author, it was quick and easy."
1466,4.0,"Thank you to the publisher for a free digital copy.-To be honest, I almost gave up on this one. It started really slow, in my opinion. However, once we got to Austin, I felt like the plot and pace picked up much more. I really enjoyed the ending too. I enjoyed how everything was not too clean. The flashbacks used tied into the next chapter-- present timeline-- smoothly. So they did not feel like a pause in our plot. By reading the flashbacks carefully you could see where Owen's life was not what Hannah thought.This is obviously much different than Dave's previous works and I am not upset about it. Her writing is fantastic and I highly enjoyed this one. "
1467,3.0,"I know I have to clarify that giving this book 3 stars doesn't mean it was bad or I had a negative experience reading it.It's just that I was misled about the nature of the story but either way I'm not angry I read it.I think you should know this is mostly a domestic drama than suspenseful story that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Despite the opening, this book is actually very tamed. It's not the explosive story that some reviews and synopsis make it to be. And it's definitely character driven and focused on characters relationships which author did an amazing job on that.And the last page, oh boy it made me tear up!I think my complain is that the story should've been more fast passed and I would've loved to feel the danger rather than being told about it. Like I know the plot twist was a big deal, but I never felt danger for anyone and conflict didn't go under my skin."
1468,3.0,"I’m a glutton for punishment because suspense is NOT my favorite genre but I often want to know what the hype is all about, so I subject myself to it. This one was on the Top 10 Audiobooks of the Year list from Libro.fm and was one of the only books I hadn’t read on the list ~ so I did it. And the first 80% was entertaining and interesting. But then things fell apart for me and just kept simultaneously not making sense and being so damn obvious. And I hated the ending. Narration ~ 4.5 Story ~ 3"
1469,5.0,"This will be one of my favourite novels this year. Big 5 stars. Before Owen Michaels disappears, he finds a way to get a note to his wife Hannah, that says 'protect her.' Hannah knows who Owen is referring to, his 16 year old daughter, and her stepdaughter, Bailey, but why? And where has Owen gone? As she continues to try and phone Owen to see why he's not returned home, Hannah is surprised by a visit from a US Marshal and FBI agents and she realises that her husband isn't who he said he was. Owen's boss is arrested by FBI and the story becomes unputdownable quite quickly. Oh my goodness, what an adventure!! I loved the characters, the broody 16 year old stepdaughter and the relationship with Hannah and the mystery surrounding Owen's identity and his past. The supporting characters and wondering how they all fit into the puzzle was so intriguing. As the story went along it turned up so many surprises and it was just sensational. Not only did I love this but my husband who read it right after me thought it was brilliant. Thanks so much to Allen & Unwin for my gifted advance review copy. As always, opinions are my own."

1471,5.0,"Fantastic storyFast-paced, compelling, and heart wrenching, The Last Thing He Told me is the kind of thriller that I can lose myself in. I barely moved a muscle, save for the catch in my breath with each shocking and intricate revelation. "
1472,4.0,I loved it!!
1473,4.0,"✨ ""What good is love, if this is where it leads you?""I finished this in one sitting because it was such an enjoyable, breezy and fast-paced thriller. The short chapters made this an easy read and the author did a good job in weaving a suspenseful tale that kept me turning the pages. This book felt like a breath of fresh air after the hundreds of thrillers I've read. Not only was the story refreshing and original, the characters were also very well-written and realistic. They weren't perfect people but yet I liked them and rooted for them.A binge-worthy thriller aside, this is also an emotional story about the things we are willing to do and how far we will go for the ones we love."
1474,4.0,"The review I wanted to leave here:“A good book with a stupid ending.”Would have easily been a five star read for me if not for the ending I want to say that I hated but upon reflection I think hate is too strong a word. It’s not that I hated it, it’s that I just wasn’t sure I believed it. Ultimately, I’m not entirely sure any ending would have satisfied me. It’s just one of those kind of books (and I am really particular about endings, so it isn’t really the book’s fault.) I can’t really say a whole lot without spoilers so you’ll just have to read it yourself if you want to know what I’m talking about.Anyway, the writing is good, and the story hooked me in from the jump. The chapters are short and punchy, just the way I like them. The parts I enjoyed most were some of the early detective work that was happening, Hannah trying to uncover the secrets in her husband’s past. The author paints a vivid setting also, which I appreciated, especially since she managed to do it without being overly flowery or descriptive in her writing.As I’m writing this review, which I realize is a raging dumpster fire (I’d tell you I’ll clean it up later, but we all know I won’t), I think the ending the author went with would have been better served if more had been focused on building up the relationship between Hannah and Bailey. Bailey’s character just isn’t given enough attention. She barely says more than two words at any given time and while I think most readers will feel sympathy for her the ending lacks the impact it could have had given the general lack of relationship between the two main characters. So it isn’t really the characters I take issue with, which do an excellent job of feeling like they could be real people walking down the street, it’s the lack of focus on the relationships between them.Not your typical mystery/thriller fare for sure, the genre is misleading. I think there is actually a good deal to unpack here. "
1475,3.0,"3.5 starsThis is a quick read for me—in page length (under 300 pages) and the fast pace of the story.Hannah has been married to Owen for one year. They live with his sixteen year old daughter, Bailey. One day, a young girl comes to their door and hands Hannah a note that she says Owen gave to her to give to Hannah. All it says is, “Protect her.”Hannah quickly figures out that it is Bailey the note is referring to. But why? Protect her from what? When Owen doesn’t return home, Hannah and Bailey set out to find where Owen is and what happened.I loved the bonding between Hannah and Bailey. I get the teenage drama. It was nice to see Bailey learn to trust Hannah throughout the story. I did feel like some of the conclusions that they came up with were kind of far fetched. It didn’t seem believable.This should not be classified as a thriller. It didn’t feel suspenseful at all. I liked the short chapters and even the chapters thrown in there from the past with Owen were enjoyable. Overall, I liked the story and the two main characters. I just was wanting more suspense."
1476,1.0,"Why...why...why is this book rates so high? The plot is inconsistent and “miraculous” not in the good sense of this word. So many plot details are just unrealistic. If a tech start-up goes busted for fraud, the authorities will not just arrest the CEO and then take time to investigate who else is involved, giving enough time (days!) for potential suspects to escape in the process. Cases like this are prepared for months if not years making sure to arrest everybody involved at the same time so that the suspects do not have any chance to escape justice or prepare for the arrest.If a CEO is involved in a fraud, then the CTO is 99,9% in the know! This is just impossible that the main coder of the software is possibly innocent under these circumstances (by the way, we never find out if Avett knew about Owen’s background and blackmailed him). If my step-daughter suddenly remembers a stadium in Texas and some orange colors connected to the team, I don’t need to call a football fan in the middle of the night to ask him which team he thinks those colors belong to - I would just google it. If my husband is responsible for exposing a OxyContin distribution ring, I would not go negotiating to one of their former members and then trust his word that all will be well no matter what family connections are involved. Because I am such a good psychologist and a judge of character?!? Please! You married a fraud and never suspected a thing. If my husband puts me through any FBI-related mess, involves me in a highly life-endangering mafia experience, leaves me to be responsible for his teenage daughter (no matter how much I love her), I would most definitely freak out and be FURIOUS (and not composed and understanding) - he never cared enough to think how his decisions affect his spouse and family (that he supposedly loves so much). Even if I don’t know what to feel, I definitely would not stay in love with a person who betrayed my trust in such a profound way. All in all, I kept wrinkling my forehead with skepticism while reading this book. As Stanislavski said: “I don’t believe it!”. Not a single word of it."
1477,5.0,I really didn’t expect to like this one as much as I did! It had me guessing until the very end. 
1478,4.0,"Lets just go ahead and say it...this is not your typical ""thriller"". It's definitely more of a mystery with a dash of family drama and a bit of a thriller-like edge. And if you go in with that expectation I think you're going to like it. I listened to the audiobook and I must say that I was hooked from start to finish. It has just enough action to keep me entertained.Hannah's husband has disappeared...the only thing he's left is a note to his new wife saying ""protect her"" -- Owen's 16 year old daughter. There's a scandal going on involving Owens company leaving a total mess in its wake...and Hannah has to figure out what was real about her relationship with the man she just married and what could possibly be total fraud. Hannah then goes on a journey alongside Owens daughter to figure out why Owen has left and where he could be now. I love the dynamic between Hannah and Owens daughter, there is so much growth in this aspect and its one of the more endearing things about this book. I loved the flash backs with Hannah and Owen as they navigate being newly married. The relationships are what drive this book so if you're looking for non stop action...this might not be the book for you. If you're looking for fantastic character development, a thriller with not a million triggers, and slow and steady action then this might be one of the best thrillers you'll read this summer.I marked down in stars only slightly because I was a bit disappointed with the ending. I have so many mixed feelings about it -- but then again a sign of a good book IMO makes you think about it long after the last page has ended."
1479,5.0,"Thank you to Netgalley and Simon & Schuster for the ARC. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 5/5 stars This book definitely exceeded my expectations. I was not expecting to get so invested in the characters and their relationships with one another. The Last Thing He Told Me is about Hannah Hall, who is married to Owen and is the stepmother to his daughter, Bailey. When Owen disappears one day, he leaves behind a duffel bag full of cash for his daughter and a note saying “Protect her.” for Hannah. Hannah and Bailey put aside their differences and set out to find the truth about Owen, hoping it will lead them to wherever he is. The heart of this book is the relationship between Hannah and Bailey. Laura Dave did an excellent job of developing each character and making the reader care about this relationship. She also makes Owen a very complex character and, using differing timelines, allows you to get to know and understand a character that’s disappearance occurs on page one. With short chapters and multiple timelines, this is a very fast-paced read. It starts quickly and never slows down. The characters are what makes the novel as good as it is, but I really enjoyed the mystery and all of the twists and turns. Julia Roberts and Reese Witherspoon are developing this book into a miniseries and I could not be more excited. This should definitely be at the top of everyone’s 2021 TBR. I can’t wait to discuss it with others when it releases on 5/4/21. ARC was provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Full review to be posted closer to release date."
1480,5.0,"One of my favorite reads of the year. Highly, highly recommended (and I have) to all."
1481,5.0,Ooh this was intriguing and full of mystery. How well do you really know your husband? Thrilling stuff. 
1482,2.0,"2 stars for getting me through the yard work. I’ve rarely loved any of Reece’s Bookclub books and this one didn’t disappoint in that department. While somewhat of a good premise for a book, The Last Thing He Said To Me was so STUPID that I just kept rolling my eyes. I’m honestly surprised at all the awesome ratings on this one. This book lost me when Hannah calls a football fan friend in the middle of the night to ask a question that she could have googled in two seconds. Somehow, she also figures out, in mere hours, to head to Austin, TX and then solves the mystery of her husband, the true identity of her obnoxious step daughter, gets a sitting with a mob boss, etc, etc, all because of her thoughts and feelings. I did not like the writing style at all and just thought this book was meh. PS. Who stashes 400k under the sink, leaves it there while you fly out of town all while the FBI (who btw, don’t hold a candle to woodcarving, detective Hannah) are after your husband and could get a search warrant and then after that stupidity, discloses it? No one. And then, who knows if Hannah and Bailey actually ever kept that money? 🤷🏼‍♀️"
1483,4.0,"I really loved this book, I loved the style in which it was written, I loved the characters and how their relationships evolves. It's an intelligent, thought provoking book that doesn't revolve only around the mistery of the husband disappearance, but also dwells on themes like love, loss, parenting and the distance one would go to protect their own child. Hannah is a strong, willfull, authentic character and I found myself rooting for her all the way to the end, I particularly liked her love for her husband's daughter and how she respects and nurse their relationship. I know someone hasn't liked the end, but I was on the verge of tears reading it, so it's a big yes for me! Thank you to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with an ARC in exchange for an honest review.#thelastthinghetoldme #NetGalley"
1484,2.0,"I enjoyed reading the part when they tried to find why Owen disappeared but when the mystery was almost solved, the grip was lost on me and I rushed to finish reading the book. (Anyway I already passed 2/3 of the book by then)Stylistic and character building is a bit bland for me - this book somehow reminds me of reading a fanfiction story.But overall, easy to read and entertaining enough without abondonging it."
1485,2.0,"Wth did I just read?! 🤦🏻‍♀️I was expecting an edge of your seat thriller and what I got was an odd, winey dialogue book about a mom and step daughter searching for Owen who has just disappeared. Ugh... I don’t even know where to start with what I didn’t like. Why is the four year olds memory that good? Why was Owen so vague with his goodbye message but so set up to disappear? And why does a mom lay it on the line for someone she’s only been married to for such a short time?! My sisters a step mom with a great heart and she wouldn’t work that hard 😆 overall, I guess I didn’t read the same book everyone else did because this just fell flat for me. "
1486,2.0,Seemed really promising and then just landed flat. Hannah (had to try to remember her name really hard) is a stepmom of a recalcitrant teen (Bailey) after a short marriage to Owen. One day her husband disappears and leaves a note saying “protect her”. She somehow immediately knows who it means and what to do. Even though she does everything wrong she ends up solving the mystery of her husband’s disappearance and somehow becomes the selfless hero of the story. I found it all trite. I read this fast so that’s a plus but I actually did not care about any of the characters and found the ending very unsatisfying. 
1487,4.0,This was a captivating domestic suspense and mystery read! I was drawn into the story immediately and I found it to be so compulsive as it felt incredibly realistic. I enjoyed the alternating timelines and found it to be well paced and really well written. It had a lot of good and fun twists along the way and i throughly enjoyed how everything played out. I’m also super excited to see the TV adaption that will be starring Julia Robert’s!
1488,3.0,"really not sure what all the hype is surrounding this book. it was fine. the beginning started off good then for me it dragged out and the ending was kind of like oh. okay. but I think I also was expecting more of a twist or something which there was not. don't go into this thinking it's going to be a real page-turner or wild ride, because that it is not. "
1489,5.0,Very fast paced book. Flips between timelines but is easy to follow. Each past timeline reveals a bit more to the story in present time. Well written and very catchy from the start! A definite recommend for thriller lovers! 
1490,1.0,"Boring story, unlikable characters and terrible writing."
1491,3.0,Just so-so-. An improbable novel about an improbable plot. Never did care for any of the characters as the author did not give you any qualities to like or dislike.
1492,2.0,they really decided to write a book about a woman’s drama with her stepdaughter and call it a mystery.rtc
1493,5.0,"So good!!!I could not put down this book!Can’t wait to watch the series!I will definitely read previous books by Laura Dave, I really liked her writing!"
1494,4.0,"3.5 (even if 2.75 for believability) I was looking for a sorbet book for the in-between, was hoping for a high-end but low-pressure novel. When I read that much of this story takes place in Austin, I sprung for it. After the first ten pages, I thought I made a mistake, but I continued, anyway. Glad I did, and allowed the story to build. I was delighted that the plot wasn’t trite or simplistic beyond the bare surface. This is largely a thematic story of love and trust. Hannah, a thirty-eight-year-old stepmother of a sixteen-year-old girl, Bailey, is forced to bond with her in ways that she desired, yet never achieved; Hannah was repeatedly rejected by the girl. Owen, Hanna’s husband of one year, always had faith that Bailey and Hannah would eventually connect. Hanna and Bailey remain the core relationship in the book.In the opening chapter, a middle-school messenger comes to the door with a note from Owen to Hannah. There are only two words written: “Protect her.” Owen, however, is gone, fled, run off, and Hannah has no clue to the whereabouts of her missing husband, or why he left. This forces the issue of Bailey and Hannah’s relationship to define and refine itself. Can they be a source of support to each other? Can they find Owen? Owen’s departure initially drives a further wedge between Hannah and Bailey. However, survival and the search for Owen depend on the two working together under baffling and dreadful circumstances.The FBI, a U.S. Marshal, and people at The Shop (where Owen works--a software start-up) pursue Hannah with questions and demands. Some at the Shop, like the owner, have been arrested for fraud and embezzlement. In quick time, it turns into a cat-and-mouse adventure, taking Hannah and Bailey from Sausalito (where they live) to Austin, Texas (where I live). The plot is exciting and packed with adventure, suspense, and thrills. Owen’s past, difficult to mine, reveals him as a cipher, with rumors of criminal behavior. All that Hannah can depend on is her faith in the two years that she’s known her husband. He walked into her woodturner business (like wood sculpting) and they fell in love soon after. Hannah has never doubted, not for a minute, Owen’s love and devotion to her and Bailey. Admittedly, the growth of Bailey and Hannah’s relationship is a bit twee, and the distance that is reported between them initially is not as edgy or intense as we are told. Bailey’s pseudo-hostility is transparent, too on-the-nose. We understand that Bailey has a big heart from the start--perhaps a more realistic animosity from Bailey would have been too offensive for some readers? The author seemed determined that we like Hannah and Bailey, unquestionably. Hannah never deters from excusing Bailey’s bratty behaviors, either, but she bent over backwards too frequently for belief. Despite plot holes and a big ask to suspend belief, THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME is entertaining and cinematic. I was never bored, and I was stirred by the closing scenes, too. Moreover, there's a polished delicacy to Dave's writing and a warm voice that appealed to me. It's a popcorn book, not literature. A movie is already in the works, starring Julia Roberts. 3.5 rounded up (even if 2.75 for believability)"
1495,3.0,"2.5/5 Boy, where do I start with this one?The Last Thing He Told Me is fashionable right now. It's checked out like crazy at every library and at the front of every bookstore...but you may notice there isn't a lot of hype for it. Probably because it's very, very average. This book's marketing budget was probably insane because if it was dropped among a plethora of other thrillers/mysteries, it would have been all but forgotten.This book is best described as a literary thriller. The prose is lovely and the plot is not very shocking or surprising. This is really ideally made for folks who like lit fiction and are dabbling in genre fiction fairly infrequently. If you regularly read mystery and thrillers, nothing new is coming out of this for you at all. It is not particularly creative nor is it shocking. The mystery is not very important and as a whole, very low stakes. The ""twists"" are not particularly well crafted, but hey, the prose is pretty. The characters are fine. The main character is no clear or discernable personality traits. The husband is not interesting. It does feel like the author wanted to write your standard lt family drama but with a twist. If that's your thing, go for it. If you want to turn your brain off for a few hours, sure. Fine. I know for a fact I am going to forget the whole plot of The Last Thing He Told Me within a week."

1497,3.0,"3.5 I decided to finally read this one because of all the buzz. I liked the author’s writing style and voice, and found the first half of the book highly engaging. Sadly, the narrative unraveled for me after that. I couldn’t suspend disbelief enough to accept the direction the plot/clues and resolution went. Trying to guess next steps in a mystery suspense is half the fun, so when the story defies reality too much, it’s a miss for me. Readers who don’t care that much about these kinds of stories being realistic won’t mind, and will enjoy it simply for the quick pace and desire to learn what happened to Owen. He was my favorite character by far. "
1498,3.0,"3.5 stars. I feel conflicted about this read, while I was captivated by the story and binged it in one read I also didn’t feel completely satisfied by the story. I listened to the audio and really liked the narrator, the story went by very quickly. I found myself more impressed with the narration of the storytelling than I was with what was actually happening in the story as far as plot. The “what happened to her husband” bit just feel kind of flat to me and the ending I definitely wanted more from. This read is definitely more mystery than thrilling and I did really enjoy the main character’s relationship with her step-daughter."
1499,5.0,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD***4.5 StarsI really got sucked into this book! I stayed up way past my bedtime to finish it. 🤣🤣 Hannah's husband, Owen, disappears and leaves her a note to protect his daughter (her step-daughter). Since she is 16, Hannah lets Bailey in on what is going on and the two of them set out to find Owen. When the marshal first showed up, I did guess that they were in witness protection. While that wasn't the case exactly, it did all line up like that. I really liked how it all played out and how Bailey grew to love Hannah. I was a little sad with the ending. I really wanted it to be a HEA and I'm sad that it wasn't."
1500,3.0,"I was quite excited for this but it turned out to be pretty... depressing.The ending was okay as well, It was something new. But I wanted more action and suspense. It looked like the leads against the whole world against them."
1501,5.0,Thank you Netgalley for the advance copy. Hannah's husband Owen disappears one day leaving her to care for his daughter Bailey. He left Hannah a note saying protect her. Hannah and Bailey set out to find him putting themselves at risk. They uncover some shocking facts from the past including Owen and Bailey are not who they thought they were. A gripping thriller highly recommended
1502,3.0,"I was devouring this book— it has a Dateline/48 hours vibe and I was loving it. Short chapters interesting characters. But the ending was a total let down and completely unbelievable. The basic gist is crime is committed,witness protection program and then girl doesn’t chose guy— which would never happen. "
1503,3.0,"3.5 stars - book like but not book love. I did whip through this in one day, though, so there's that. Hannah is recently married to Owen. The marriage came with a 16-year-old daughter, Bailey, who really loves her dad but barely tolerates Hannah. Then Owen disappears after leaving Hannah a note saying only ""Protect her"" and leaving Bailey a bag with over $600,000 in it (I'll take the bag, please). The rest of the novel is their search for Owen and the real reason he's running. We do find out the reason in the end and, for me, it was a bit unexpected. (Spoiler: He wasn't kidnapped by aliens.) So, an okay read but this one probably won't stick in my memory for too long. It was a good way to spend a day."
1504,4.0,"Fast paced, very enjoyable"
1505,4.0,4.5 ✨! I loved this book. The characters are all likable and I didn’t see any of the twists coming. Def recco especially if you like a mystery. 
1506,4.0,"Hannah is shocked when her husband, Owen, disappears leaving her alone with his teen daughter, Bailey. Where is he? And why did he feel the need to run?

1507,3.0,3.6⭐️خوب اول اینکه موضوع کتاب برای من جدید نبود اما نویسنده بیان خوبی داشت و دوست داشتم هی بخونم ببینم چی می شه.یه جاهایی از کتاب رو دوست داشتم و یه جاهایی رو نه .در کل برای من معمولی بود.پایان کتاب هم خوب بود.
1508,2.0,"I suppose this is fair agricultural stuff, but it started to annoy me half way through and never really stopped. It isn't terrible--I've read a lot worse--and it is a quick read, but certain things about it irked me. The main one was that the author never says in one paragraph what she can say in five. Something happens and then the main character has to EXPLAIN it all, ostensibly to herself. This happens over and over again. It made me think of those true crime shows on tv that go along for a bit, then there's commercials, and when they come back there's a recap for five minutes before they move ahead again. The plot, if you haven't read the blurb, is that there is an Enron-style blow-up at the outfit where this woman's husband works, and he disappears, leaving her with instructions for his daughter: ""protect her."" She, with step-daughter in tow, goes off on an unlikely wild goose chase to distant cities, trying to figure out what is going on, and how much of what her husband told her about his previous life is actually true. And then, amazingly helpful strangers being amazingly easy to find, and then mobsters and crime families and the usual run of workaday ho-hum. Btw, you'll be expected to believe that this 40-something woodturner (high-end artisan carpenter to the rich and famous) is going to broker a deal with Scary Mob Lawyer. Interspersed with all of this are her warm recollections of wise nuggets her Grandfather told her, which happen ad infinitum. ""Grandfather!"" Holy Heidi. Anyway, it started out well, then got annoying, until finally I couldn't wait for it to end. Not recommended, but not completely awful if all you want is some Lifetime Movie type fluff."
1509,4.0,"This novel completely hooked me. The author has written it in a way that keeps you engaged the whole time, and only gives away a little bit each time. It is more about a stepmothers relationship with her stepdaughter than her relationship with her new husband Owen. I really feel like I’ll give away spoilers if I write to much here so I’ll just say that the main character thought she knew her husband, but more and more details come to light that shows how much she doesn’t know. Who does she trust? And who is he running from? Why won’t he come home? I really enjoyed this book so much. I felt like it was really a 5 star read up until the last chapters. But I really liked the writing style and I absolutely LOVED how much Hannah (stepmom) loved and went out of her way to protect Bailey (stepdaughter). Her love was fierce and proves it isn’t blood that makes a family. "
1510,5.0,"How far would you go to protect the people you love? That’s the premise of this riveting story by Laura Dave. Hannah and Owen have been married a little over a year, living an idyllic life in a floating home in Sausalito with Owen’s 16-year-old daughter, Bailey. The only wrinkle in Hannah’s happiness is her relationship with Bailey who, like many teens, isn’t too excited to have a stepmother. One day, a stranger deliver a cryptic note from Owen to Hannah with only two words: “Protect Her.” Hannah knows instantly that the “her” in the note refers to Bailey. The note is otherwise a mystery – who does Bailey need to be protected from, and why? That same day, Owen’s boss is arrested by the FBI for fraud and Owen disappears.  Soon, the FBI and a US Marshal are interested in Owen’s disappearance too. Why did Owen flee? Is he involved in the fraud or is it something deeper? Hannah comes to the realization that the man she loves is not who he seems to be, with a past neither she nor Bailey know anything about. They embark on a path to uncover Owen’s secrets, which draws them closer together as they work to unravel his past. Let me just say – wow! I have never read’s Laura Dave’s work before, but I could not put this book down and finished it in less than two days! You might think – ho hum, just another corporate fraud tale, but no! This book is not just a mystery (although the mystery is engrossing and very well done) but also a domestic drama that explores the evolving relationship between Hannah and Bailey at the same time. The development of their relationship is very moving and feels very authentic as Hannah protects Bailey and earns her trust. The story is told in both the present and in flashbacks, which Dave does particularly well in this book. “The Last Thing He Told Me” is twisty and emotional and I loved it! The epilogue lets us know how things pan out in the future. A few reviewers didn’t care for the ending, but I found it realistic and satisfying. Many thanks to NetGalley and Simon and Schuster for providing me an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
1511,4.0,Such a good mystery/suspense novel filled with intriguing characters and great writing. I was on the hunt for a book to get me out of my slump and this book did it. I read this in 1 day and just wanted to know how it would end. Highly recommend
1512,4.0,"this book was captivating, grabbing your attention so you just can’t help to want to read more and know truly what is up with owen michaels. the relationship that developed between bailey and hannah was so unexpected but so amazing! their relationship gave hidden depth to this book that just made it that much better. ALSO THAT EPILOGUE AHHH. overall, much enjoyed and i would highly recommend! "
1513,4.0,"Looking for your next great read? Check out all my book reviews on MomAdvice and join our Patreon community for loads of bonus bookish fun.This book is making big buzz this year and I'm HERE FOR IT, especially since I have enjoyed Laura Dave's prior books so much.Not only was this book selected as a Reese Witherspoon Book Club selection, but it also has been chosen for a brand new series, starring Julia Roberts.Imagine if your husband disappeared and only left behind a note telling you to protect his daughter and a bag of money.Well, that is exactly what ends up happening in this intriguing mystery, from Laura Dave.Unfortunately, not only does Hannah want to get to the bottom of the mystery, the F.B.I. would like to.What Hannah and her stepdaughter discover though is that Owen has been leading a double life and that his lies go so much deeper than they could ever expect.It forces both of them to question everything about their past relationship and a deep desire to discover why Owen was so intent on hiding the truth.I would recommend this novel for fans of, ""The Husband's Secret."" If you need an audiobook this month, I would encourage you to give this one a spin.The narration was really well done and the mystery was solid from start to finish.I really look forward to seeing what they do with this series, especially with such a great casting choice."
1514,3.0,"The Last Thing He Told Me starts out with a bang as a husband suddenly disappears from his wife and teenage daughter's lives. Owen's new wife, Hannah soon receives a note from him with two words - 'protect her'. That note begins Hannah's quest to find her missing husband and protect her stepdaughter, leading her down a road of secrets and lies.I think this book is a domestic mystery that is just shy of a suspense read. But it also veers into the domestic drama realm with its focus on the growing relationship between stepmom Hannah and her teenage stepdaughter, Bailey as they band together to find out what happened to Owen. Hannah proves her resourcefulness in figuring out what happened to her husband, but I couldn't help feeling that some situations seemed too far-fetched and easily found for someone with no investigative experience. Hannah and Bailey's characters are well-developed, but this is more of a slower paced read. Flashbacks are provided to give readers more insight into Hannah and Owen's relationship, but I was hoping to gain a better understanding of Owen's motivations. I would have loved to have his POV. It was an interesting premise about Owen's whereabouts/past but while the ending was sweet, it was much too pat for my liking.This story has tense situations, but this isn't an edge-of-your-seat thriller. Instead, Dave focuses on building her characters and their rocky relationships while telling an intriguing tale of secrets, lies and manipulations. This was a quick, enjoyable read that surprised me with its focus on relationships more than suspense. Look for this book in stores May 4, 2021!Disclaimer: My sincere thanks to the publisher for my complimentary digital copy of this title in exchange for my honest review."
1515,5.0,Loved this one! Could not stop reading and stayed up late to finish it. A really good story about a husband that goes missing. I really enjoyed all the researching and clues as they try to find him. This will definitely make a good movie. Thanks to Netgalley and the Publisher for the ARC
1516,5.0,"Do not, and I mean do. not. start reading/listening to this book right before bed because you will absolutely stay up reading until early, early in the morning like me. That said, I'm having a hard time putting into words how I feel about this book. While there are things I loved about this book (the voice, the tension, the characters, the mystery), there are also aspects of it that I didn't fully connect with. Mostly, I think that is because I am a romance reader at heart (#readerflaw), and I like my endings saccharine-sweet and all tied up with a pretty pink bow. This is not that. Not exactly, at least. I did feel satisfied even though the ending was more resonant than romantic, but let's just say that right after I finished listening to this book (at 3 am), I stayed up even later (earlier?) to read author interviews, hoping to see that the author is already working on a sequel.Content warning: some language, mention of violence."
1517,5.0,"Wow. This book was fantastic. I expected suspense when I picked up The Last Thing He Told Me but I didn’t expect to be so utterly sucked in. From the first few pages I felt a connection to Hannah and I was invested in her character. Her relationship with Owen was written so well, I was firmly on her side as soon as things started to get tough. And I kept liking her character as the story went on. I couldn’t put this book down and read it in two nights. Hannah and Bailey were realistic and relatable characters and it was easy to want to stay with them as they worked to uncover the secret behind Owen’s sudden disappearance. The story unfolded at an excellent pace and I wasn’t allowed to get bored or frustrated with the speed of the mystery. And I did not expect the ending and what an ending it was. This book was an excellent suspense novel and I definitely recommend it to any fans of the genre. The story was unique, the characters were well written and the pacing was perfect. I give this 5/5 because I couldn’t put it down, which is exactly what you want in a suspenseful story; and it did it without guns blazing which is even more impressive. !Slight Spoilers Ahead!I’m heartbroken about the ending. But it was written well and with the way the characters were formed, it was the only way it could have ended and stay true to them. His actual last words to her brought tears to my eyes. I don’t know how it could have gone differently but we readers don’t always get our happily ever after do we."

1519,4.0,"Based on the description of this one I thought I would be able to easily see where this one was going, I mean how many missing/lying/scheming husband books have all of us thriller fans read by now? Well friends, I was wrong this was actually pretty unique and I’m really glad that I decided to give it a shot!I feel like the publisher’s synopsis is all you really need to know here so I won’t be discussing any plot details, instead I’ll tell you why I enjoyed this one so much. It was fast paced as it flipped from present day to a few chapters from the past back when Owen and Hannah first meet and there was never a dull moment. Hannah as a character was great, I found her to be relatable and really believable as she’s put in such a strange and upsetting situation, can you even imagine getting a weird note from your husband and then he’s just gone? It also had a really strong ending and if you know me you know an ending can either make or break a thriller for me. The audio narration was fantastic, Rebecca Lowman was amazing. I’ve listened to a few books she’s narrated and she’s definitely becoming one of my faves. I love the way she expresses emotion and complexity into her voice, there were plenty of emotional moments here and she captured Hannah’s voice SO well. Definitely a really fun summer thriller, this would be fun to listen to during a road trip!"
1520,2.0,"I was not impressed with this book at all. It left no impressions on me. I kept holding on, hoping it would live up to the hype, but it never did. "
1521,5.0,"Laura Dave spins a great tale of mystery, intrigue, and family in The Last Thing He Told Me. I was mesmerized y this book and for me, it was a ""can't put down"". The plot centers around a couple and their daughter. The husband disappears under mysterious circumstances, leaving the wife a note asking her to protect the daughter. What the wife must find out is to protect her from who or what. The wife is amazed when the husband's disappearance is also of interest to the FBI and she must justify her own innocence and lack of knowledge of why her trusted husband may have disappeared. The daughter, in her rebellious teens, adds to the stress for the heroine by her rebellious actions. Since her beloved daughter is not the biological daughter of the heroine, there are spaces in the past that are unknown to her and make solving the mystery and protecting the step daughter that she loves difficult. If you are a lover of mystery, family, and romance you will love this book. Thanks to #NetGalley for the opportunity to read and review #TheLastThingHeToldMe."
1522,5.0,"Hannah married the love of her life, and now she’s living with him and his 16 year-old daughter in sunny California. Things are pretty great, until the day her husband’s company is all over the news for suspicious/illegal activity, and he’s nowhere to be found. When Hannah gets a note that says, “Protect her,” she realizes it’s her husband’s way of asking her to protect his daughter, but do to so, Hannah decides to go on a hunt for information that will change her life forever. The last few books by Laura Dave haven’t been as good as her earlier work (in my opinion), but this one is really fantastic. Fast-paced with intriguing storytelling, I read it in about two days. If all of her books going forward are as good as this one, I think she’s going to garner an even bigger fan base.5 StarsNOTE: Special thanks to the publisher and NetGalley for allowing me to read this book in exchange for an honest review."
1523,3.0,"3.75 stars I wish I could have given this read 5 stars, it sure had the potential. The book started out so great leaving you with so many questions that will keep you turning pages all night. But the ending was a real letdown due to how intense the build up was. It just wasn’t enough for me. I needed more. Such a bummer! ☹️*******So many of my reviews just seems to disappear from Goodreads so I am re-posting this one*****"
1524,5.0,"I read The Last Thing He Told Me in an afternoon, I couldn’t put it down!! The first page starts off with the mystery of why Ethan has disappeared, and has given a young girl a scrawled note to deliver to his wife. The note says one sentence: Protect her. From there, Ethan’s wife and daughter are off to understand why he ran, and who he really is. Just as you think you might know where the story is going, there’s another twist to keep you guessing. The book ends with heartache and joy, a duo that are seemingly at odds with each other, but make sense here. Laura Dave has crafted an incredible thriller, that will have you racing to turn the page to find out what happens next.I absolutely recommend The Last Thing He Told Me!"
1525,1.0,"Who, what, where, when, WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYY did I have such high hopes for this book? Oh, because the first half was delectable and the second half had me scratching my head, looking like the emoji with the questions marks above its head! The second half of this book felt so overwhelmingly rushed. By the time I reached the final chapters, I was waAaAAaay past the point of even caring to get up and grab a notepad and pen to write out the facts and even attempt to wrap my head around this story. The best part of this book? The final word. Yes, the final word, not because it was the final word (LOL) but because it was a quick “HIGH-YAA!” to the feels. Wow I’m LMAO because the best part of The Last Thing He Told Me was... the last thing SHE TOLD ME. Oh jeez. I am so punny."
1526,4.0,"Hannah and Owen have been married for a year. His sixteen year old daughter, Bailey, isn't a fan. Hannah has been working hard on building a relationship - nothing works until Owen disappears. A knock on the door changes their lives - a young girl delivers a note from Owen. Protect her. Owen's software company is under indictment- the CEO escorted in handcuffs. Hannah and Bailey know Owen would never participate in shady dealings - so why did he run? A US Marshall from Austin arrives - adding more confusion and frustration. But he gives Hannah a starting point. After she learns Owen and Bailey Michaels didn't exist - until 10 years ago. I couldn't put this book down. I stayed up past my bedtime to finish. Great writing. Excellent mystery. Loved the characters."
1527,4.0,"sometimes i get burnt out from reading and i need a quick, absorbing, and engaging book to get me back into the mood, and this did the trick perfectly. this does a great job of straddling thriller/women's lit and unlike so many modern thrillers, reveals answers/clues at a reasonable rate (i hate when they try and withhold all information from you and the reader is basically stumbling around in the dark). laura dave isn't interested in trying to trick or conceal-- it's very much a book about the relationships between these characters, what we choose to hide, and what we do for the people we love. the ending really really moved me. "
1528,5.0,"Stunning. I listened to the audiobook … and couldn't stop listening. Life went on hold until that perfect last line. The writing is superb, with not a single word wasted, and Hannah is an outstanding heroine. After her husband of a year disappears with nothing more than a note that says, ""Protect her,"" Hannah goes above and beyond to safeguard the stepdaughter who has given her nothing but attitude. Hannah's interior dialogue, with her constant epiphanies, were riveting. They had much to say about family and how we accept all the parts of someone we love. An incredible edge-of-the-seat mystery that deserves the hype."
1529,2.0,"Ridiculously unbelievable. Hannah, after mothering Owen’s angry teenage daughter Bailey for 2 years, suddenly finds Owen has disappeared one day. As Hannah and Bailey try to figure out why he ran away, they uncover his past. Which isn’t all that interesting. Are we really to believe that Hannah isn’t furious with Owen for deserting her and his daughter for the rest of their lives? That she is totally fine with it and understands his reasoning? Cmon. "
1530,4.0,"the rumours are, in fact, trumours.this book really is as adorable as everyone is saying."
1531,4.0,"The first 1/3 was tough for me to get through because I found the multiple forced PDA scenes mortifying + I’m not into professor/student romances and had to get over that (even though she’s a grad student and they don’t work together) + the protagonist generally acting embarrassing (girl please be more professional!!). However, chapter 12 onwards was smoother sailing and when we got to the good stuff: juicy misunderstandings, hurt/comfort, smut, a big protective dude, etc. The book definitely requires suspending my disbeliefs, but I enjoyed squeeing at the romance once I could fully get into it."
1532,5.0,"it gave what it was supposed to give and 10x more!this shit is a literary masterpiece! flawless! perfection! excellent! splendid! and above all epic…these characters have bewitched me body, mind, soul! these bad bitch scientists had me acting all submissive and breedable 🛐Olive- pumpkin spice loving bad bitch was so inspiring and all around an enjoyable MC to read about. this book proves ANYONE (especially nerdy girls like me and olive) can girl boss, gate-keep, and gaslight!!she’s a bad bitch that deserves the world !!! but i’m also jealous of her because she has Adam !? like um sharing is caring #SelfishScientist anyways…Adam- this mfing dadddddy! had me screaming, clutching my pearls, and aggressively ripping my shirt off! i fucking love this strong, needle phobic, 6 foot something KING!! he’s a fucking thot y’all! don’t even fight me on this. he had my legs fucking divorced in chapter 16; his pov and Olive’sthe plot and writing were excellent! yes this is fiction but it’s written so realistically ya know? it ain’t fabricated. the emotions were raw. my heart was swelling for these characters. bruv why did i read this so MFing fast?!?! i don’t want it to be over. overall this book had me trembling, gasping for oxygen, sweating through my hairline, weak in the MFing knees, and pinned down to the ground. i had so much fun reading this. it had my attention from cover to cover! ain’t no one doing it out here like queen Ali Hazelwood!!

1533,5.0,"OMG! Look at the cover reminds us Reylo (Kylo and Rey disguised in lab coats, kissing each other till they get breathless), two nerdy adorable characters who were pretending as couple: a rigid-a.hole but also charismatic 34 years old professor and sweet, quirky, gold hearted Phd student who tries to find the cure of pancreatic cancer! I’m sold!!!  Banters are nerdish, sexy, entertaining but I have to scream at hot professor Adam’s face at each time he calls Olive smart ass! I wish he may have called her something smarter, catchy, more affectionate maybe? Olive Smith is an orphan, insecure, hard working, smart biologist spending the most of her time in the lab for her research and emailing colleges for funding to work on the cure of cancer with brand new method. After losing her loved ones at young age she becomes insecure about relationships. She is happy with her research, spending time with her close friends. There’s nothing she cannot sacrifice for them. As soon as she breaks up with her boyfriend she doesn’t even like, she realizes her bestie Anh likes her ex way too much. To prove a point that she already moved on her life, she decides to kiss the first guy passing through the corridor while Anh is watching so she can believe in her and date with her ex. The plan was simple till the guy she randomly kissed turns out Adam Carlsen, a young, hotshot lab tyrant most of the students curse the day they met.  But interestingly he doesn’t get furious about her love triangle tantrum. Actually he agrees to pretend acting like lovers for his own reasons to get enough fund to finance his own researches. Both of the parties seem like benefit from this arrangement till Olive realizes she likes way too much their Wednesday coffee dates and don’t forget the fact that she keeps drooling over his six packs. Even though he’s named as professor from hell, he always treats her sweet, respectful and he seems like he also enjoys to spend time with her. But Olive has to wear big girl pants to face with her true feelings even though her love is unrequited. Could she be brave enough to come clean with him? What if she has to risk at more than broken heart? Overall: I loved nerdish heroes and their gibberish scientific sweet talks! I enjoyed their chemistry!  #metoomovement , emotional and physical abuse themes were sensitively added into equation.  Holden and Malcolm were my favorite supporting characters.  I loved the academic romcom premise!  I went back and forth between four and five sisters but finally I rounded up 4.5 stars to 5 because of my love for MCs. Especially Adam earned millions of brownie points after the final revelations. He’s sweetest kind of douchebag!  This book made me feel so good and put a long and wide smile on my face, made my entire week.  Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this digital copy with me in exchange my honest thoughts."
1534,5.0,"edit: moving this up to 5 stars bc I'm editing the vlog footage and any book that made me scream the way this one did deserves god tier rating. rip headphone users in advance, sorry about ur eardrums <3Hypothesis: Maybe I really am just a lonely bitch who only finds happiness in seeing fictional couples get their HEA? And that's okay? Just kidding lol, but also definitely not?I genuinely didn't think that I was going to enjoy this book as much as I did, especially with the obscene amount of hype it has received all over the internet....but DAMN was I wrong. The Love Hypothesis melted my stone cold heart and made me experience every single human emotion possible in 385 pages, so intensely that I have very few words to say about it that can be typed without keyboard smashing. If you need me, I'll be busy sitting in the corner physically restraining myself from rereading this book & weeping over the fact that fictional love is fictional (asjkfgsdjakls)."

You’re hook line and sinker baby.Not one dry page here.Adam is one of the MOST WHOLESOME CHARACTERS IVE EVER READ Jesus Christ I’m so in love with this man. And OLIVE?!? My dedication to these two is downright unhealthy.I’ll ride hard for this book forever. It goes down as one of my top reads this year.SOOOO MANY GREAT THINGS ABOUT THIS BOOK.The banter.The SPICE. Wait on chapter 16 JUST WAIT ON IT!!!The friendships.ADAM BEING SCARED OF NEEDLES.Olive wrangling out an ice cream sandwich from him.HIM LETTING HER!!WOMEN. IN. SCIENCE.I was a weeee bit scared that the science talk would confuse me because science is definitely not my strongest subject but easy peasy.I’m just obsessed. Rightfully so.This book is phenomenal and I REALLY REALLY need an Adam POV. That epilogue was amazing. The layout of the book is amazing.I’m thrilled about this. Holy crap.

Everything about this was honestly perfect. The writing, the characters, the chemistry (literal and figurative lol), THE SMUT. This was SO hot, but also SO cute and SO funny and I just loved absolutely every second spent in between these pages. I didn't know who Ali Hazelwood was before going into this, but I will now be anxiously awaiting every book she will ever publish because this was JUST SO GOOD YOU ALL NEED TO READ IT / ADD IT TO YOUR TBRS IMMEDIATELY!

Over and over, and in ways that she could never have anticipated, he had made her feel unjudged. Less alone.

I want to say this is a case of “It’s not the book, it’s me.” But then again, isn’t that the case for every book we end up disliking that everyone else enjoyed?The Love Hypothesis sounded promising. A PhD student wants to prove to her best friend that she has moved on and is dating. With no way to prove it, she kisses the first man she sees, which ends up being none other than Dr. Carlsen, known as one of the most unapproachable and critical professors. With his own reasoning, he agrees to become Olive’s fake boyfriend. But what starts as a fake relationship and fake feelings later turns into what Olive wishes were real instead.Professor x student relationships are some of my favorites to read about, especially the younger college student with the academic professor. However, this one still caught my attention, especially considering Adam is moody, sullen, and grumpy, aka my favorite. Olive is also a woman in STEM, and it’s something many young women can relate to. I loved this representation personally, and her experience as a scholar conducting research felt realistic, especially considering she’s not American (she’s Canadian), she’s not male, and she’s pretty young (26). Most of these end up being boundaries for young folk pursuing PhD careers in America, and it’s impressive to see representation like this. This was probably my favorite part of the book because Olive tells us how it’s been difficult for her to participate in a rigorous program like this, from being denied opportunities, not being believed in, to being seen as inferior, all because she’s a young woman in a predominantly male-dominated curriculum. While I’m not a STEM student, I even see it myself in the political field I study in.Men teach most classes, most advisors and major professors are also male, most students in classes end up being men, and everything else is usually male-dominated.Also, it’s not exactly stated, but Olive may or may not be in the asexual spectrum. It’s briefly mentioned in the beginning, even the term is used, and when she and Adam are about to have sex, she mentions to Adam, “It’s not that I want to not have sex. I just . . . don’t particularly want to have it. There is something weird about my brain, and my body, and—I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I don’t seem to be able to experience attraction like other people. Like normal people. I tried to just . . . just to do it, to get it over with, and the guy I did it with was nice, but the truth is that I just don’t feel any . . .” She closed her eyes. This was difficult to admit. “I don’t feel any sexual attraction unless I actually get to trust and like a person, which for some reason never happens. Or, rarely. It hadn’t, not in a long time, but now—I really like you, and I really trust you, and for the first time in a million years I want to—” This is obviously something I wish was expanded more on. However, I still liked the explanation of it and appreciation the mention of it.Adding on to that, Adam being the broody professor that most people are scared about, try to avoid, and are scared to approach, checks off the boxes of the fictional men I personally love reading about. Young, tall, broad, has dark hair, grouchy, scares off everyone, has a resting-bitch face, doesn’t care about the student’s feelings, and somehow only has a soft spot towards the woman he has been pining over for about 2 years. Yup, it marks it all.“That’s the thing with science. We’re drilled to believe that false positives are bad, but false negatives are just as terrifying.” She swallowed. “Not being able to see something, even if it’s in front of your eyes. Purposefully making yourself blind, just because you’re afraid of seeing too much.”However, aside from that . . . there’s not much else I enjoyed. One part of the problem is Adam himself (I know I said I like characters like him), but I have my reasons. Adam felt, respectfully put, very, very bland. It was difficult to understand his personality and the type of person he was other than moody and sullen because it’s something we are constantly and repeatedly told, especially Olive. You could say he needed much more seasoning.Not only that, but by visualizing what I read, I couldn’t picture Olive for the life of me. All I remember from her is that she is a PhD student in the Biology Department at Stanford University, is Canadian, 5”8, and I guess she has brown hair based on the cover. And . . . yeah, that’s it. Visually, I could envision Adam more than Olive, yet we spend the entire book in Olive’s mind (since it’s told from her point of view). This all ties back to the writing and how difficult it was to enjoy the book more because of how little description was given to the characters. Adam, for instance, wasn’t one-dimensional, but it also felt like he needed more personality. I understand him being sullen and broody is part of it (which, as I’ve said before, is perfectly fine with me and understandable), but I feel like it has to do less with that and more with just the mere fact that Adam is just . . . Adam. A young, hot-shot professor who hardly ever smiled and went through tough situations as a PhD student himself. It feels like it could be enough, yet it wasn’t.Speaking of, Olive’s personality also felt a little childish sometimes. The situation that led to Olive kissing Adam (without knowing, of course) is completely unrealistic, so it’s one you need to put your logic to the side for. While the premise was interesting to me, it also made no sense to me how a PhD student, one who is researching pancreatic cancer in one of the best Biology departments of the United States, would kiss a random man she saw in the hallway because she wants to prove to her best friend that she truly is over the boy her best friend wants to date. Because . . . yeah, that’s the actual situation. Olive’s best friend, Anh, wants to date Jeremy, Olive’s ex. Olive is over him and wants nothing to do with him, but Anh thinks it’s breaking the girl code by dating Jeremy, even though Olive knows Anh really likes Jeremy. So to prove that she’s over him and is dating someone else, she kisses Adam when she sees the opportunity that Anh can see them.Pretty unrealistic scenario for a PhD student, if you ask me.Part of these quibbles made the romance more unrealistic and less believable. I had everything I love: professor x student, grumpy x sunshine, and fake dating. But all good things must come to an end. Because of the inability to imagine Olive, not appreciate an unseasoned broody man, and express concern over a PhD student's attitude at certain times, the romance also failed. There were definitely some of the good moments I love in a romance: the first real kiss, feeling the comfort of the other’s touch, realizing you’re whipped for someone you thought you would only see for 10 minutes, but the chemistry felt off. In a sense, it’s slow-burn. It takes a while for the two to kiss with real feelings inside the two, and while I love a slow-burn, I am still always about that emotional connection, and Olive and Adam felt like they didn’t have it. I firmly believe part of it has to do with the fake dating itself. Some of their moments felt awkward and even forced sometimes that I wondered how the two would develop. They were also in moments where they had been “dating” for a while now, in a way the two would really know what to expect, yet they still fumbled like two teenagers experiencing love for the first time. In a way, they were, but I didn’t like how it played out for a PhD student and professor with a PhD. It just made it too unrealistic. There weren’t enough moments between them that made me root for them as a real couple and hope for the best. I even feel as if they weren't friends just because everything they were doing together was part of their whole ""We're dating, so we need people to see us"" scheme. Their moments felt completely forced, and not even because they’re fake dating. They just truly felt boring.While I had no problem with the writing style itself, I expected to be told more about Olive and Adam. I couldn’t understand how or why Adam liked Olivia. Other than her being nice and intelligent, there wasn’t anything else to understand.Olive first had a crush on Adam, which was understandable, but based on her inner monologue, that crush quickly turned into “I love him” mode, which I was unable to understand where it came from. Most of the moments Adam and Olive have are part of their fake dating scheme (they want Anh, other students, and faculty to see them for reasons. Don’t ask). While they talk professionally and personally, it made her crush on Adam realistic and understandable (a crush is easily made, anyway), but the whole love thing felt like it came out of the blue.And the sex? We don't talk about it.Again, I want to say this is a me thing, but I truly don’t know. If you know me well, you know it’s easy for me to enjoy a romance even if half of my friends didn’t like it. Give me good characters and good dialogue, and realistic emotional connections, and I’ll be good to go. But give me awkward moments between a couple that tries to date and confused love confessions in their mind, and I’ll be confused as well.I wish I could say I laughed at the humor, but I truly didn’t laugh at almost anything. The side characters also felt a little too immature for me sometimes, especially Anh. She forced Olive to interact with Adam, like the sunscreen situation, the car situation, and the lap situation. Some of the situations (like miscommunication) felt understandable because of the plot and the scenarios both Olive and Adam were in, especially considering how the fake dating happened in the first place and what the “rules” were. Other than that though, there wasn't enough for me to like.“I’m going to kill you,” he gritted out, little more than a growl. “If you say another word about the woman I love, if you look at her, if you even think about her—I’m going to fucking kill you.”Overall, The Love Hypothesis had minimal appreciation from me. It being something that may feel too good to be true, it left me confused. I hoped to see some of the relationship development grow on me, but it just felt tedious. I hardly found myself smiling and laughing (like an idiot), which I usually do with books like these, but this one only felt dull. So if you’re still interested in reading this, please ignore me and my emotionless heart right now and give it a chance. You might end up finding a new favorite if you think about it. If not, then you can join me, and we can question our feelings together.ARC provided by Berkley Romance.

1543,5.0,"Ah, scientists in love! Be still, my heart!Olive is a third year Ph.D. candidate, filling her pipettes and titrating like a boss, when she somehow manages to land herself in a fake relationship with the ever glowering Dr. Adam Carlsen. She really can't believe her bad luck. Unfortunately, she has spun her lies, so she has no choice but to see them through. But the more time they spend together, the more Olive starts to realize he might just be the one she's been looking for all along.This was just a hoot and a half! A lot of romcoms manage to get the romantic part exactly right, but The Love Hypothesis hit the comedy bit out of the park too. Olive's dialogues are witty and snarky, and she pretty much cracked me up from beginning to end. I couldn't stop giggling and snorting, even while reading in public, which definitely got me some weird looks from strangers.I absolutely loved that Ali Hazelwood chose a woman in STEM as her main character, and highlighted the difficulties they encounter as part of this story. As a woman in STEM myself, it warms my heart to see someone like me take center stage in a romance. A lot of what Olive went through, including how intimidating it is to be in a field surrounded by men and how unsure she is of her worth and her ability, I understand intimately.The romance between Olive and Adam developed slowly, with plenty of tension and sizzle. The premise to set up the trope of fake dating was a little silly, but once you get past that, the rest is nothing short of sweet and satisfying. Adam is reticent in the beginning, but he soon thaws and warms up to Olive's relentless cheer and good-natured teasing. His support of her in their shared field is particularly touching and it made me root even harder for this couple.This story totally checks all the boxes for me. It's sweet, smart, and uproariously funny, and it touched my heart and my mind. No doubt about it, anything Ali Hazelwood writes from now on will be devoured by me posthaste.This was my Book of the Month pick for September.

1544,4.0,"– 4.5 starsI heard this book started out as a Wattpad story and people weren't impressed with the writing, but honestly I'd take that as a back-handed compliment. Have you read the right Wattpad stories? Some of them are masterpieces and no, I don't take criticism. And no, I'm not talking about After either 😌The Love Hypothesis will go down as the biggest surprise of this year and no one is more surprise than me. This book has been EVERYWHERE I go. I couldn't outrun this book, even if I wanted to. And you know with hype comes great expectations. And with great expectations comes even greater disappointments. Therefore, I made it my mission to go into TLH expecting nothing and received everything.I've read the prologue and I WAS HOOKED!!! When do you ever stumble into a stranger's bathroom blinded, because you're wearing lenses that has been expired for years and said stranger is going to be your biggest motivator for the years to come? Olive and Adam's meet-cute already had me on a chokehold. 
""It's fine."" She waved a hand. She'd have rolled her eyes, if they hadn't been on fire. ""The burning usually lasts only a few minues.""""You mean you've done this before?""She frowned. ""Done what?""""Put in expired contacts.""""Of course. Contacts are not cheap.""""Neither are eyes.""
Followed, the story was brimmed with so many rom-com tropes. SO MANY. Maybe Ali Hazelwood tried a little bit too much to bring all of these tropes in one story and maybe it was a bit too much. Personally, I didn't mind it, cause every Olive x Adam interaction just made me smile like a fool. But here is a list of all the tropes, you can expect when reading The Love Hypothesis:💫 age gap (Olive, 26 & Adam, 34)💫 sunshine-grumpy💫 fake-dating 💫 slow-burn💫 workplace romance💫 Ph.D student x professor (but it's not forbidden)💫 mutual pining 💫 friends-to-lovers also known as dumbasses-to-lovers💫 one-bed trope (kinda)💫 Hero sees heroine in his clothes and is can't talk for a second💫 guy simping for the girl first 💫 dimples💫 asshole-ish Hero who is only soft for his girl 💫 endless banter and teasing 
""Come on. Maybe we're lucky and the chair will spot us. And I'll buy you an ice cream sandwich afterward.""""Will I be paying for this ice-cream sandwich?"" He sounded resigned now. ""Likely. Actually, scratch that, you probably don't like ice cream anyawy, because you don't enjoy anything that's good in life."" She kept on walking, pensively chewing on her lower lip. ""Maybe the cafeteria has some raw broccoli?""""I don't deserve this verbal abuse on top of the flu shot.
I'll spare the subpar summary of this book, cause y'all can read the blurb for yourself and jump right into everything else 😂｡･ﾟﾟ･ The Romance　･ﾟﾟ･｡Just look at the list above. It literally has all of my favorite tropes in one book. From the first interaction between Adam and Olive I was clued to the pages. I love their easy banter with each other. Olive teasing him about his age. Adam's hate about everything sugary (but especially Pumpkin Spice Latte). 
""Are you going to be less harsh, then?""""Unlikely.""She sighed. ""You know, when I have no more friends and everyone hates me because of this fake-dating thing, I'll be super lonely and you are going to have to hang out with me every day. I'll annoy you all the time. Is it really worth being mean to every grad in the program?""""Absolutely.""
Adam is notoriously known as the campus asshole professor who makes every grad student piss their pants. He's super strict when it comes to research and calls his student out on their bullshit when someone is not good enough. But when it comes to Olive, he is a soft harmless kitten. He believes in her so much. Adam always encourages and praises Olive for her brilliant work. Adam Carlsen is Olive's #1 fan. 
""I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.""
Women in STEM are underrepresentated and it was refreshing to see Olive being one of the few women working there and making a difference with her research on pancreatic cancer. It was interesting to read Olive's frustrating with being a grad student.. all the struggles and insecurites that come with it. All these priviliged white men that think they are some hot shot, but doing the bare minimum work. Olive's smart, a great friend, but you know when I fell in love with her? When Olive and Adam went on their first fake coffee date and Adam offered to pay for her coffee, cuz he knows she's a poor student and what does that girl do? Adds chocolate chip cookie, a banana and a pack of gum to her coffee 😂😂😂 the audacity lmao yes girl get that luxury package lunch 😂
""You're so big."" He groaned into her neck. His entire body was vibrating with tension. ""You can take it.""
The Love Hypothesis was very low on the heat level, but that one sex scene we got. I looooved it 🥵🥵🥵 Every time a Hero has such a big dick that the heroine doesn't know if she can take it and he assures her that she can I'M SCREaMINg 🥵🥵🥵 When Adam tells her that he wants to go down on her until she passes out 🥵🥵🥵🥵 When Adam asked Olive if he can fuck her... I'm on my knees for my consent king 🛐🥵 Adam Carlsen, ik hou van jou 🛐🛐🛐Adam: My arm hurtsOlive: From the flu shot?Adam: It's really painful.Olive: Oh, Adam. I'm so sorry. Olive: Should I come over and kiss it better? Adam: You never said it would hurt so bad.Olive: As someone once told me, it's not my job to work on your emotin regulation skills. Adam: 🖕｡･ﾟﾟ･ The Friendship between Olive and Anh　･ﾟﾟ･｡Anh is Vietnamese and I never see Viet rep in romance book so ofc I'm going to love this girl. Not biased or anything. Anh was a queen anyway and it wasn't hard to stan her 💅
""No matter how many pounds of spoiled shrimp cocktail you projectile vomit, you can trust me. We're a team, you and I. And Malcolm, when he's not busy screwing his way though the Stanford population. So if Carlsen is secretly an extraterrestrial life-form planning a takover of Earth that will ultimately result in humanity being enslaved by evil overlords who look like cicadas, and the only way to stop him is dating him, you can tell me and I'll inform NASA–""
Find yourself a best friend who would marry you if she thinks you will get deported back to Canada and need a green card. 🥺You don't understand how much I love Anh. She was probably my favorite characters from this whole book (no offense to Olive and Adam, cause I love them a lot). My love for her already started that she didn't want to date Jeremy, because Olive dated him and gave her approval. This girl knows the girl code too well and it's for her that Olive had to come up with this ridicilous idea of kissing the first guy she sees in the hallway to convince Anh that she's over Jeremy, so these two can get it on. But then, Anh is also the best wingwoman without knowing. All of her demands for Olive and Adam to show their PDA (Olive using Adam has her chair ✔️ Olive putting sunscreen on a half naked Adam ✔️ Olive kissing Adam ✔️) The list of sexual harassment Adam could compile, I'd love to see it. 😇｡･ﾟﾟ･ The Side-Characters　･ﾟﾟ･｡The rest of the secondary characters like Holden and Malcolm were awesome too. I love Adam and Holden's friendship. How Holden tries to embarass Adam and Adam pretending to be annoyed and tolerating him even tho their bromance is more than solid. Most of all Holden has Adam's back. 
""I have access to your Google Calender, asshole. You're not busy. If you don't want to hang out with me, you can just be honest.""""I don't want to hang out with you.""""You little shit. After the wee we just had. And on my birthday.""Adam recoiled slightly. ""What? It's not your birthday.""""Yes, it is.""""Your birthday is April tenth.""""Is it, though?""Adam closed his eyes, scratching his forehead. ""Holden, we've talked daily for the past twenty-five years, and I have been to at least five Power Rangers-themed birthday parties of yours. The last one was when you turned seventeen. I know when your birthday is.""""You always had it wrong, I was just too nice to tell you.""
Malcolm and Olive had a cute friendship too. Loved how Malcolm was so support of Olive's feeling for Adam even tho he didn't like him. Malcolm with Anh probably the only characters with some brain cells. He gave Olive some good dating advise, but did she listen noooo. ｡･ﾟﾟ･ A Book not without its faults　･ﾟﾟ･｡Like the clown that I am, I really thought this book might be a 5 star read after only reading the prologue lmao that's how much I loved Olive and Adam's first meeting 😂 But of course I jinxed myself, cause there were a couple of things that I annoyed me. I call this book dumbasses-to-lovers for a reason. Olive and Adam had clearly feelings for each other, but were too chicken shit to confess them. Olive had confessed to Malcolm that she was falling in love w Adam and Adam heard it and when Olive said she was talking about someone else, that dumbass really believed her. I mean it makes for good angst for exacly 3 seconds cause I could feel my boy's pain, but how could he not known it was him all along. Same with Olive and her thinking the ""amazing girl"" Adam was pining for all these year was some random women in his faculty like 😭😭😭 guys I thought you were SMART 😭 And that ending was so unsatisfying. I hate it when a romance doesn't have a proper love confession scene. I know Adam loves Olive and he told it to other, but we never got his ""I love you"" that he said to Olive. There was her confession and then it was cut right to the epilogue that wasn't all that satisfying either.. ｡･ﾟﾟ･ Conclusion ･ﾟﾟ･｡Should I study for an exam that I have tmrr and instead have read this book? Yes. (1)Will I fail said exam because of this book? Also yes. (2)Will I blame Ali Hazelwood and fictional characters for my inability to manage my life? Y-E-S. (3)Would I do it all over again? See answers (1) to (3)No regrets, I love Olive and Adam so much and The Love Hypothesis will be in my favorite books I've read this year. ♥️P.S. this book taught me to carry myself with the confidence of a medicore white man if I wanna reach my goal and I'll always remember that. I'll go into the exam with that mentality, I'm suing if I'm still going to fail 😌"

I'm gonna call it right now, The Love Hypothesis is going to be my favorite debut of the year. I actually cannot believe this is a debut novel. Ali Hazelwood writes like a seasoned author and I seriously loved this one. It was nerdy in the best way, adorable, steamy, and a heck of a lot of fun! Olive is a Ph.D candidate who doesn't have the time or energy to date. But to appease her best friend, she needs it to appear she is. The most unlikely fake-boyfriend she can think of is who she ends up kissing. The young professor with the reputation of being a hardass, Adam Carlsen. This was seriously one of the most fun fake-dating books I've read in a while and I loved the spin this author put on it. Olive cracked me up with all of her fake dating knowledge, the 'one bed' line was one of my favorites of the book. 

""You could room with me.”“I couldn’t.”“The room is a double, of course,” he offered, as if that piece of information could have possibly changed her mind.“It’s not a good idea.”“Why?”“Adam.” She rubbed her forehead with her fingers. “There will be only one bed.”He frowned. “No, as I said it’s a double—”“It’s not. It won’t be. There will be only one bed, for sure.”He gave her a puzzled look. “I got the booking confirmation the other day. I can forward it to you if you want, it says that—”“It doesn’t matter what it says. It’s always one bed.”He stared at her, perplexed, and she sighed and leaned helplessly against the back of her chair. He’d clearly never seen a rom-com or read a romance novel in his life. 

The banter, the humor, the romance, this one just had everything I loved all tied up in a fantastic slow burn romance. Adam was exactly the kind of grumpy hero I love and Olive was a wonderful heroine. I have a feeling The Love Hypothesis will be making a lot of people's top favorites list this year and I can't recommend it enough! This is a must read, friends!! "
1547,5.0,"OHHH MY GOD. This was…. incredible. Grumpy hero. Sunshine heroine. Fake dating after she kisses him to show her best friend she’s moved on from her past relationship. Super nerdy/set in STEM and academia. She’s the only one he’s soft with AND he’s crushed on her for years!!! AHHHH.If you couldn’t tell, I loved THE LOVE HYPOTHESIS so much! I started it last night and stayed up late reading it. When I woke up I immediately went to finish the rest (but I definitely could’ve finished it in one sitting if I started it earlier in the day, it was that good.) The writing is fresh and fun, the romance is the SWEETEST, and the whole cast of characters is amazing! Olive and Adam are dorky and endearing and I just adored them. And hello Adam was able to move a car with a dead battery all by himself with his bare hands (and muscles)??? I’m going to be thinking about that for…. a while.This was a fantastic debut and I already can’t wait for more from Ali Hazelwood!"
1548,4.0,"“How many times have you done this?”“Zero. But I am familiar with the trope.” “The . . . what?” He blinked at her, confused.A fake dating trope book in which the main character Oliver is aware of the fake dating trope. Yet she decides to fake date someone. Someone she thinks is not nice. Someone who hates people. And yet she decides to fake date him because it's the real world right? Things like falling in love with someone while fake dating happens only in rom-coms and as her friend Anh says,""Nuh-uh. This is a Hallmark movie. Or a poorly written young adult novel. That will not sell well.""Olive scratched her nose. “Because he is . . .” It cost her, to say the word. Oh, it cost her. But she had to. “Nice.”If you ask me why did I read this book when I was already reading 3 books at the same time. Well there are lots of reason for this question but the best reason is H.Y.P.E. Literally everyone was reading this book at the same time and everyone was rating it 5 stars. Now this reminds me(and almost everyone) of some other book. Any guesses? No? The name of the book is *drum roll* The Spanish Love Deception. Now let's compare these two books. 1.Fake dating trope 2.Both of the main leads work at the same place.3.Male character is hard from outside but soft from inside.And that's it. No more similarities between these two. And I really shouldn't even be comparing these two.Olive opened her laptop with half a mind to google “Organs one can live without” and “How much cash for them”Let's talk about Olive. I like her a lot. She's relatable, strong. She was one of the few women working in STEM and she don't get disheartened by the sexist nature of people working over there. I know I shouldn't even be comparing myself with her but I have studied with around 25 boys and me being the only girl so I get how sexist people can get. But let's not talk about that. My point is there's one scene where she gets angry at Adam because someone else called her out for being Adam's girlfriend. So a lot of people hate her for that but I don't. The only problem is that I really don't get how fake dating Adam would help Olive to get out of her friend's radar. But then okay you want to be a good friend then do whatever you feel like but Anh seemed to be way too pushing. She forced Olive to do a lot of embarrassing stuffs and Olive did it because she wanted to show Anh that she's finally over her ex. Other than this I loved the book. I was laughing so much the entire time. Here's one of my favorite scenes from the book. Don't worry the scene takes place in the beginning of the book so nothing would be spoiled for those who haven’t read this yet.“Did you… Did you just kiss me?” He sounded puzzled, and maybe a little out of breath. His lips were full and plump and… God. Kissed. There was simply no way Olive could get away with denying what she had just done.Still, it was worth a try.“Nope.”Surprisingly, it seemed to work.“Ah. Okay, then.” Carlsen nodded and turned around, looking vaguely disoriented. He took a couple of steps down the hallway, reached the water fountain - maybe where he’d headed in the first place.Olive was starting to believe that she might actually be off the hook when he halted and turned back with a skeptical expression.“Are you sure?”"

When you combine a strong, independent women who works in STEM, with a broody, Kylo Ren look alike that will have you craving more of their quirky romance...
For those whom have been following my reviews, y'all know that I am always hesitant to start a new author. Especially a debut author whom's writing is something that I have to get acquainted with. However, Ali Hazelwood has out done herself. I should not be surprised since Berkley Romance always has the best releases and they simple just know their audience completely. With that being said, Adam and Olive have taken a toll around my heart and mind to falling in love with them and their ""fake"" trop romance. Their first interaction is my ideal type of ""cute meet"" that we all romance lovers will instantly fall for and just obsess with. The rom-com appeal to this novel is also one that will seriously attract you right away.A quirky independent STEM female student is introduced to a broody academia mentor that has no facial expressions, and is broody and just absolutely addicting to the reader. Their fake relationship starts off as a way of convenience. A convenience for both Olive and Adam. While helping each other out, Olive realizes that her ""fake"" emotions are not so fake after all. And the risk of Adam finding out is not something she is willing to take. But Olive will never be able to have enough of the way that Adam is. No matter how broody he may be towards everyone, he is not towards Olive;

 ""Maybe it was the words, or maybe the tone. Maybe it was the way he'd just told her something about himself, or how he'd taken her hand earlier and saved her from her misery. Her knight in black armor..."" 

With time, and the obstacles that come in the way of Olive's future research towards pancreatic cancer, she knows that it's not an easy route to take. But with the help of Adam and of course, her very well independent smart self and the courage and confidence of striving to get the answers she needs, Olive shows us that being a women in STEM is a beauty to read and know more of. And when Adam finally puts his walls down and expresses his true feelings towards Olive, it's one heck of a story fo just adore and simply fall for. I am looking forward to see what else Ali has up her sleeves. I can see this turning into a series, I wish it could be for Holden and Malcum because who doesn't like a good MM romance, am I right? But either way, I am beyond excited to see what else Ali has for us romance lovers. ARC kindly provided by Berkley Romance, in exchange for an honest review...Follow Me On:Instagram ♕ Twitter"
1550,2.0," The Love Hypothesis is the kind of book that I think is better for newbie romance readers. For me, with thousands of romance books under my belt, it became painful to read by the end. I started out reading The Love Hypothesis feeling giddy and elated. I *adored* the geeky, surly professor and poor grad student dynamic, and the narration by Callie Dalton was bangin'. I was 100000% sure that I was going to love this book, and I started recommending it to everyone. But slowly, slowly, things starting creeping in.I will be the first to admit that The Love Hypothesis is an impressive debut from Ali Hazelwood. I'm impossibly excited to read her future work, but I dearly hope she changes a few things about how she crafts romance books for her second novel. This book is *excruciating* at times. The number of miscommunications and misunderstandings and deliberate withholding of information truly boggles the mind. With such a skilled narrator and such a great start to the book, you would think I would be riveted to the story, but by the end I had to speed up the narration a ton just to force myself to finish. I wanted to smack both characters in the head. Repeatedly. It is a huge pet peeve of mine when authors rely on miscommunications for the whole tension and plot of a book, and by 50% of the way in, it became abundantly clear that this is what we were facing. I was pretty upset that what had seemed so promising took such a sideways turn. Look, maybe you'll love this book and eat up every morsel, but I was actually angry by the end of this book. Your mileage may vary with this one. goodreads|instagram|twitter|tiktok"
1551,2.0,"**Spoiler Alert**The best part about this story is the focus on women in STEM everything else is a blurry, one-dimensional mess that left me with way too many questions.1. What if Olive hadn't fake kissed Adam? Would he have continued to wait even more years before engaging with her?2. Olive kissing a random guy instead of properly communicating with her supposed 'best friend' is outlandish. Their motivation for keeping up the lies (and yes, they were both lying) was unconvincing. 3. How did Olive go (within a span of 2 hours) from being a victim of sexual assault to joking about bad sushi and inconsequential things. That scene could have been so powerful yet it was poorly handled by Hazelwood.4. Anh, the 'best friend', is such a cliche character. Ugh5. Hazelwood threw in asexuality to tick a box, not because she wanted to actually write an asexual character. Olive trying to explain her sexuality while Adam was going down on her was one of the funniest non-funny scenes I've ever read. Like, girl, stfu.6. Finally, what exactly does Olive look like??!!! I knew she was 5'8"" and skinny. For that matter, I know more about Adam's henleys and plaid shirts than I do him.Overall, I was left feeling dissatisfied especially the fact that I didn't laugh even once. Isn't this meant to be a rom-com?"

1553,5.0,"UMMMMM THIS WAS AMAZING!?!? I was definitely scared to start this because of the hype, but this was grumpy hero, fake dating PERFECTION. I was obsessed with this romance from the moment that Olive kisses Adam in front of her best friend. I loved how Adam was this grump who took his job seriously and didn't care if anyone liked him. He slowly opened up to Olive and I love how they slowly fell for each other. This is definitely a slow burn, but I ate every moment up. I also loved how this was about a woman in academia and all of the obstacles women go through. It was hard to read at times near the end with how Olive was treated just because she was a woman in a male dominated industry. I was worried she wouldn't open up to Adam, but, of course, it all worked out in the end! Adam was definitely my favorite and I am literally obsessed with him now! "
1554,4.0,"Excuse me a moment. I just have to give myself a little pep talk. Won't take more than a paragraph or two.Okay, Emma. I know you - gag - felt...feelings during this book. I know you were invested in the romance in a way that you have rarely been invested in anything that can remotely be construed as warm and cozy and positive. Your most-watched movie is Spotlight and when you were at home alone for a week you spent it rewatching Mindhunter and You. Your heart is typically shale-esque, in hardness and brittleness and darkness. So I know that you're tempted to give five stars for the fact that it cracked your Grinchy shell and made your heart grow three sizes or whatever, but no.This is not a perfect book even though reading it was, like, a near-perfect experience.Even I, who thinks the miscommunication part of any romance is the best part due to the fact that is the most angsty and suffering-based, thought there were about 7 miscommunications too many here.And I could have used a bit more personality from our love interest. Maybe, I don't know, actually I take that back because men should leave being fun and characterized to women, who do it better.Okay. End pep talk because it isn't working. This is an insanely cute and skipped-heartbeat-inducing book and I want to give it five stars for that alone.Maybe I'll come back to it.Bottom line: Yippee!

The fake dating trope is one of my favorites, so obviously, I adore with this book. Olive is relatable and dorky and cute and we love a woman in STEM, and Adam is my dream man in quite literally every single way. The book is fast paced, engaging, witty, and unexpectedly emotional at times. I strongly recommend this one if you're a fan of The Spanish Love Deception, The Unhoneymooners, or the Emily Henry books. 5 stars all the way."
1556,5.0,"4.5 stars Maybe it’s the fact that I’ve been feeling more cynical about the romances I’ve been reading. Maybe it’s the fact that the book has the sweetest romance accompanied by a lot of talk about women in STEM which I can relate to. Or maybe it’s just the fact that these two were So. Freakin. Cute!!!!Everything about this was just so good!! Their banter??? Ahh I could set and listen to their banter for hours. Adam was such a perfect sweetheart. The way he used to be in love with her for years? The way he supports and protects her? The consent? The pining? How he was such a grump who makes people cry, but he’s such a total softie with her? I just love him. the romance was cute. Their interactions were cute. Those two together were just so freakin cute and adorable and I’m just so in love.The book was so tropy, but ugh it just made me smile like an idiot the whole time. I didn’t mind it at all. The book just made me feel so happy. And yes a little bit mad because women in STEM are treated so unfairly which made me feel so angry for Olive. And I loved how she talked about her struggles and insecurities, because academia is just..a lot. I’m also kinda annoyed it took both of them too long to confess when it was just so obvious and so easy to confess their feelings, but whatever they were both idiots and I forgive them."
1557,4.0,"i deserve an olympic medal for the mental gymnastics i went through to NOT imagine the love interest as the actual adam driver, and i failed spectacularly. i don't know how it's legal or even acceptable in the pubishing world for a book to literally transplant real people as its main characters, but go off queen. it's like if christian grey in 50 shades of grey was named edward or robert and hardin from after by anna todd was actually named harry styles. the story itself was fine, but i exerted a lot of energy pretending to not notice all the ways the author was quite literally copying other characters (and real people).this book was better than i expected because it took two things i typically dont love in romance, the fake dating trope and the academia environment, and made it a pretty addicting read. i agree with other reviews that you don't learn a ton about olive, but she was still enjoyable to read about. for a book that's so praised for its smut i was surprised that there was only one sex scene, but this book definitely had its moments of tension that made it intense all the same. i thought the first half dragged just a little bit because there weren't very many hard-hitting plot points until the midway point, but i still read it all in two sittings.now im just gonna sit here and wait until someone plagiarizes the witcher and i get a romance book about a 6'2 man in a silver wig named henry"

agony
 of having to read this. yes, i was held at gun point and forced to finish it, do not ask questions, i am not allowed to talk about iti actually picked this to have something fun and easy to read in-between studying but instead i got this infuriating reading experience and a massive spike in my heart rate just from sheer annoyance. you will hear from my cardiologist, believe me, he’s not happy.this was just plain boring. do i care about the couple? no. they could have not ended up together and it would have made no difference to me. why would i root for people who can’t manage to open their goddamn mouth and just talk to each other about their feelings? how does anyone even have relationships? the miscommunication in this was just *chefs kiss* and not in a good way. everyone and their mum knew that adam was in love with olive and yet. yes this man who let’s you coat him in sunscreen and buys you your disgusting pumpkin spice latte (yes, i am with adam on this one. but. hear me out: i’m allergic, so.) and looks at you like the sun shines out of your ass is definitely head over heels for another woman. makes sense.also, the whole spiel about adam being this huge asshole when in reality he a. wasn’t and b. was actually right in that one specific instance and just doing his job of „raising“ good future scientists by giving them pointers how to do good research. and yet i had to sit through that whole drama of „buhu, how dare you date this mean prof, who made me do actual work on my dissertation, i will now hate you, because you are enabling him by dating him“. first of all, have you considered that you’re just doing shit work. second, how the fuck is it olive’s problem. why did i have to read this. it was such an unnecessary conflict. there’s this thing in romance books where they have to hyperfocus on one of the man’s physical attributes and if it’s not the eyes it’s his fucking size. we get it. adam is big. HUGE. ENORMOUS. A FUCKING GIANT. HE HAS MUSCLES. I GET IT!!!!!! HIS FINGERS ARE MASSIVE AND SO IS HIS DICK. GREAT.you didn’t have to tell me in every paragraph though. i know i have shit memory but i am not close to dementia yet. once or twice would have been enough. like what do you want me to do? shall i applaud him? good job growing, i guess you ate your carrots as a kid, go you!have i mentioned that this book could have been 350 pages shorter if they had just talked to each other? communication, so important.this book started every chapter with a hypothesis except that most of them weren’t actually hopotheses but who cares. who cares. wait… my test theory prof is calling and i think he does. other than that, the science was actually the best part of the book. also the criticism of the bad working conditions of phd students was very well done. i’m only a master’s student but a phd might be in my future plans and i can already feel the poverty, so #relatable.there were only two chapters i liked: chapter 16 and chapter 20. small spoiler ahead.chapter 16 is the sex chapter and in chapter 20 a certain character gets called out on their behaviour and adam does this sexy thing of nearly beating them up.having read another review that has quoted chapter 16 though… ugh… cringe. idk what i was on reading this. in my defense i haven’t seen my boyfriend in a week so maybe i was feeling touch starved.also, there's this very fine line between finding your partner so sexy that you can't control yourself and premature ejaculation. i am not saying that adam belongs in the second category. but i am.i still stand by my opinion that chapter 20 was sexy.i did actually like adam even though he’s a very stereotypical grumpy-only-drinks-black-coffee-and-eats-broccoli kind of character. he is definitely kinda bland. but maybe i just like my men bland *shrugs*.i have like zero opinions on olive though. she was there i guess. all in all: i don’t think this book has done anything new or swoon worthy. the characters were average. the story was average. the writing was average. i don’t really get why everyone is so crazy about it. i guess the STEM aspect was fun but even that has been done before i think?overall, i was mainly bored and infuriated by the amount of unnecessary drama and height descriptions. you all do you i guess. but i’ll do me: 1.5 stars"

I live for that. I hate waiting for the plot to finally start after 999 pages. Adam is such a kitty cat pleaser, its not possible to dislike him really. He’s sweet, brooding, super tall, protective and has an amazing sense of humour. His humour seriously saved some of their conversations. Olive is an interesting character to follow, especially because I could relate to some of her inner turmoil when it comes to relationships. She is also the main initiator which is not often the case in romance books. Yes, some scenes made me cringe and ask myself “is this who we are” but hey. Gotta support women in STEM. If you’re into academia settings, you’ll love this book. It’s on every page and the main character basically. That wasn’t that big of a deal to me but I could use a bit of a break from faculty and research and blah blah for one chapter😅There was only one and a half chapter with spice but damnnnnnn was it good😮‍💨Btw if you haven’t read Adam’s pov chapter, go check the author’s newsletter to receive it👀"

1561,5.0,"~ 4.5 stars ~The Love Hypothesis delivered. It seemed like everyone and their mother was reading this and hyping it up when it came out, and I was a bit worried it wouldn't live up to my expectations, but in the end, it did. I completely adored this. This book has it all. Woman in STEM. The fake dating trope. The grumpy x sunshine trope. Great characters. Well written dialogue. It was such a fun time. I finished this in one day because I actually couldn't put it down. This is Reylo fanfiction, which is obvious with the cover, and while I do love Star Wars, I never liked that ship. I don't see what everyone sees in them. I wasn't the biggest fan of the sequel movies in general, but whatever. Plus I'm always hesitant when I hear fanfiction has been published. But thankfully, this book did seem to be its own. There are some minor parallels, but it isn't overwhelmingly obvious. I loved Olive. She is a biology graduate student and is getting her PHD, which is always amazing to see. I could relate to her in many ways. She is someone who is in her head a lot, which was what I saw myself most in. She is hyper focused on her education, and has come a long way, yet always doubts her skills. Olive is a complete sweetheart, sharp minded, and I really did like reading about her. I read chapter 16 in Adam's POV (you can access that by signing up to Ali Hazelwood's newsletter btw), and I found that I preferred her perspective better. To be fair, I wasn't a fan of chapter 16 in general, but whatever. But I still loved Adam just as much. He is the highly celebrated and accomplished grumpy professor with a bad rep from students, but a soft spot for those close to him. He would do almost anything for them. Adam is the perfect love interest. And chapter 20...I'm obsessed. I really liked his dynamic with Olive and seeing them open up to each other. The romance was so adorable, perhaps a bit cheesy, but still adorable. I couldn't stop smiling.I think the side characters are really good too. Holden was my favorite, but I did like Anh and Malcom too. There were a few things that stopped me from rating this 5 stars, but ultimately, I am willing to overlook. There is the whole miscommunication trope that frustrated me, I skimmed all the science parts because that stuff bores me (I don't like most science subjects, so it more of a ""it's me not you"" type thing), and it repeated ""oh"" like a million times. Plus the word hypothesis is not used right. All of Olive's hypothesis' are just predictions. A hypothesis is something you can test, right? But I guess since this is a science centered book, it is what it is. But overall, The Love Hypothesis is just such an enjoyable and refreshing read. This was exactly what I needed and wanted at the moment, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cute romance book. tw: sexual assault"
1562,5.0,"RE-READ 2021: There is a reason why I absolutely adored this book ♡ ___________________________________OMG I don't know what to say...... but one thing is sure, it's one of the BEST romances I read in a very LONG time!!!!It's so good!!!!

Full review
This book was everything I love about a romance. It was refreshingly different, with an engaging plot and a wonderful supporting cast as well as two main characters that pulled on my heartstrings.I’m a HUGE fan of characters that are different, and I loved that Olive and Adam weren’t your run-of-the-mill couple. They were both scientists at heart, and both were personalities that had a hard time making new friends. And I loved that when their friendship grew into more their connecting became visceral, palpable. It hit me right where it counted. Also I think I was grinning for most of the book.There were so many amazing scenes between them. Olive teasing, Adam being grumpy, but also totally wrapped around her finger. The back and forth between them was priceless. The banter. The humor. The friends. This book had it all!!And OMG the sex scenes, which weren’t many, but the few were AMAZING!!!! Absolutely beautifully done, hot, sexy, and sizzling. I think I caught myself reading with an open mouth, they were this sensual.It’s not easy to put all these feelings into words.There aren’t many romances that really surprise me anymore. And with that I mean that romances with unique characters and a different kind of story are rare. Many romances fizzle out, this one did not. I also loved that the author took a popular trope but put her own spin to it. And that she really committed to the science background. She did an amazing job with it, and it was obvious she knew what she was talking about. And even though I always expected the other shoe to drop, thankfully the author did an absolutely fantastic job with the climax.Moreover the novel had great LBGTQ and BIPOC representation!!!___________________________________I received a copy of this book from the publisher for free in exchange for an honest review.

1564,4.0,3.5 starsSo cute. Perfect for grumpy x sunshine trope enthusiastsMore thoughts can be found in this week’s vlog: https://youtu.be/6P3z0JUy8LI
1565,5.0,"What... is happening? What did I just read? Was this the best book ever written? Am I having a stroke? What are these f e e l i n g s???Okay, first things first. We have Olive, a PhD student whose best friend is into this guy she was seeing, but can't bring herself to take a chance on him because of Girl Code. And we have Adam, a hot, surly, hot, unpleasant, hot, scary, HOT professor with very big shoulders and very little patience who's had his research funds frozen by Stanford because rumor has it he's accepting an offer from another University.Really, it's only logical for them to go into a fake dating scheme to make Olive's best friend more comfortable and Stanford less suspicious.Of course this premise is delicious, but the way this book is written is devastatingly good. The whole time I was reading it, I kept thinking, 'I can't believe there will come a time when I'm no longer reading this book for the first time.' And here it is, and I'm not okay.I realize I'm barely coherent right now, but here's the gist of it: I can't speak highly enough of The Love Hypothesis. I can't believe it's over. I tried to read it as slowly as I could, but I still devoured it. I'm reeling.Huh, maybe I did have a stroke."

3 solid stars.

“He’d clearly never seen a rom-com or read a romance novel in his life.”
Buckle up, bitches, there are some spoilers ahead!So, as you may or may not have seen, the 3 stars on my rating system stands for: 50/50 - meh, in which categories this book fits in. I honestly don't know if I should shelve it as ""big hype, big lie"", because it's 50/50, so my decision it's hard tbh.I honestly haven't read a lot books with ""miss sunshine and mister grumpy"" trope, but I kind of know how the thing goes, so yikes.For what I know, this book was a Reylo fanfic, so picturing Adam as Adam Driver wasn't complicated. But it made it hard for me because. . . Idk, it's not that I think he's ugly, but I don't think either that he's sexy. If you find him attractive and that stuff, then you know your reasons.I've seen a LOT —y'all know that I don't lie with this— of hype for this book. *looks at booktok, booktwt, bookstagram* So, I had to give it a try. . . Every single day appears on my feed at least 6 times in a row friends' updates of this book, so, I thought ""this book must be good"".Anyhow, I don't actually know how to feel about this book. . . It was. . . weird? Sweet? Awkward? Immature?Idk, you name it. I'm fan of nerd and smart people who're not smug, arrogant and assholes. Actually, there's more probability that I fall in love with some nerd (I'm not straight, so, lol) like Adam or Olive than for someone like Tom (he was hot, but he was such a fucking dick).I had ZERO expectations from this book because lately ""great"" and overhyped books tend to disappoint me to the point of not wanting to have high hopes (don't start with the ""then why do you read them?"" because I'm not a nice person when it comes to insult people, lmao) aND YET, HERE I AM, WRITING THE REVIEW OF THIS BOOK.I need to check up on my life choices. . . Which makes me go to the thing that drove me mad in this book: eVERY SINGLE FUCKING TIME OLIVE WAS LIKE ""YES, THIS IS MY LIFE BECAUSE OF MY DECISIONS"", YES, SIS, WE GET IT. YOU'VE MADE SOME SILLY AND POOR DECISIONS, BUT BUCKLE UP, AND MOVE THE FUCK ON.Also, I was so fucking tired of the “carry yourself with the confidence of a mediocre white man” Yes, we get it, white men are mediocre. Most of them are. I just don't know why, but that phrase pissed me off.Chapter 16 was so hyped. Bitch, no. It was awkward and it seemed very very very forced. It is mentioned (briefly, but there it is) that Olive might be asexual, which is fine and I don't judge that because I am ace and I totally get how it feels. Nevertheless, I did think that was forced: I perceived her uncomfortable doing that, despite the fact that she agreed. I honestly don't know how sex works, lol. Totally unnecessary. I get the hype for some things, but not for chapter 16. It wasn't spicy in any single way. It made me feel uncomfortable and I was cringing every 10 seconds. I thought that something good was gonna happen, and I was left with empty hands because I received nothing from that chapter.Idk why, but Olive seemed VERY immature and Adam was flat? Yes, Mr. Grumpy and-I-hate-everything-black-is-my-color-because-black-is-my-soul-and-I-make-my-grades-cry. I get the trope, I really do, but give him some personality??? Adam it's perceived as someone complicated and who loves their own personal space (again, I don't judge because I enjoy my own personal space as no one) and Olive describes him as ""antagonic and unapproachable"" aLL THE TIME. If people told me that, I'd take it as a joke, but deep down that shit hurts, even as a joke or random comment, but, yeah, us, grumpy people, are like that. I get that Adam is huge, that have big ass hands, big body, big shoulders and big dick. wE GET IT. Just please stop repeating it every damn time the damn man appears.Sometimes, I disliked Anh. I didn't know if she was around 26 or 15. She basically forced Olive to do things that obviously she didn't wanna do, despite the fact that Anh thought that Olive and Adam were dating and she didn't know the whole truth. She was very flat and at the very end we didn't have a lot of her.After the big disappointing that chapter 16 turned out to be, I was even more disappointed than ever. I mean, as I said: I had very little —if none at this point— expectations, but chapter 16 made it go from 0.01 to -00000000000000000000 in a span of 5 minutes, and I didn't wanna read anymore. ALTHOUGH, CHAPTER 20 SAVED THE DAY AND IT WAS FUCKING SEXY.When Adam said, and I quote: ""If you say another word about the woman I love..."" I lost my shit. I was fucking melting and no, I am not ashamed of it, lol.The romance was okay I guess??? I don't know why, but I expected more. Please don't ask me why, because even I don't know the answer to that.Overall I guess it was fine? Idk dude, writing this review made me realize that I didn't like this book as much as I wanted.Tho I'd fake-date / fake-marry someone to get out of Latin America (third world country issues, lol) and get the citizenship in another country, perhaps Europe or Canada? Idk, love can come with time, lol.Tom was an asshole and I wish Adam would have punch him in the face :)In overall, as I didn't enjoy a lot of romance (or think that actually was romantic, cute and that stuff) makes me think that I'm a heartless and cold bitch who can't feel a single thing or will never fall in love. bUT I'M ALSO A HOPELESS ROMANTIC. I NEED HELP.

1567,5.0,"first of all as a woman and stem, i can absolutely say this book did us justice, i’m not a scientist I’m an engineer but either way i feel very well represented. This story is so good it’s so easy to follow i read it so quickly i even surprised myself. adam is the perfect man truly, he’s brooding and quiet but intelligent and so caring. It also serves in an academic setting, and i really thrive reading books about those. i would like to put him in the same category as connor cobalt but i don’t know if he deserves that level just yet, but i will say their energy is quite similar at least to me. this book was very fun for me and i really liked it so for that it gets a 5/5 stars."
1568,5.0,"PERFECTION! I loved this book so much. I honestly couldn't say one bad thing about it. The writing was amazing, it's fake-dating which is the superior trope and it was honestly such a funny and feel good book. You all NEED to read it!!!"

1571,4.0,"**4.5-stars**Picture it: an adorable Meet Cute in a bathroom of a research wing of a University. Unfortunately, our smart and quirky protagonist, Olive, is having major issues with her contact lenses at the time and never gets a good look at the guy she's talking with.Regardless of her optical challenges, the interaction made an impact. In fact, it sort of helped her decide the course of her life. Her decision to pursue a Ph.D. was in a way spurred along by that encounter.Three years later, Olive is now a Ph.D. candidate at that very University, living a perfectly normal single student lifestyle.That is until her best friend, Ahn, falls for the guy Olive went on like two dates with. Olive seriously doesn't care if Ahn goes for it. She doesn't have feelings for that guy, but Ahn isn't buying it.Therefore, Olive does what any good friend would do and creates a fake dating relationship with the first man she can literally grab.The man in question happens to be Adam Carlson, a young hotshot Professor with a surly reputation. What could go wrong?Pursuing motivations of his own, Adam agrees to go along with Olive's scheme. Logically, it is a win-win for both of them, but can they keep to the boundaries set-up at the beginning of their agreement?I really had fun with this story. Olive was such a great main character. I grew quite attached to her over the course of the story and was rooting for her to achieve all her goals.Additionally, I felt that the incorporation of a female main in STEM was such a refreshing set-up for a Contemporary Romance. The University setting, the research issues and politics, the hot professors, it was all so engaging!The fake dating was actually quasi-plausible and I enjoyed watching the evolution of Olive and Adam's relationship as they got themselves in deeper and deeper.Adam is definitely a swoon-worthy male lead!Overall, this is a memorable, science-is-sexy story and I want more from Ali Hazelwood; definitely one of my favorite Romance stories of the year, if not my very favorite.Thank you so much to the publisher, Berkley Books, for providing me with a copy to read and review. Highly recommend!"
1572,3.0,This book gave me diabetes and a permanent eye twitch.
1573,4.0,"4 stars 🔬Well this was kinda adorable and a really light-hearted read for the most part. Was it perfect? No, but honestly, who the hell cares. What shocked me most was finding out, 50% in, that this was originally a freaking fanfic for Kylo Ren and Rey (Reylo) from the Star Wars sequels 😂Some people were annoyed by that and I was honestly confused cause y'all don't remember 50SoG being a Twilight fanfic??? I kinda love when fanfics get turned into books and movies. Feels like an inside jokeFor that reason, I'm going to harass all the Reylo haters with this Reylo gif-filled review 😌💋Tropes:☕️fake dating☕️hero falls first☕️friends to lovers☕️grumpy-sunshine☕️professor-student☕️hero is an asshole to everyone except the heroine☕️the hero is literally inspired by Adam Driver what more could you ask forI just loved reading about Adam (H) being totally infatuated by Olive (h) and her just standing there like 🧍‍♀️ like girl open your damn eyes and look at what in front of you! Adam has basically been simping over Olive for years and would constantly talk about 'that girl in the bathroom' that he met literally once, but because of a contacts mishap, when Olive and Adam 'meet', she didn't realize it was him because she never saw his face during their face real meeting, but Adam knew her.So, when Olive explains that she needs someone to pretend to date her, he's on-fucking-board that train, in fact, it was his fucking idea 💀All the subtle hints that Adam gives off basically gave me life because let's be honest, it's so much better when the hero pines after the heroine. Like when Adam has to attend a required picnic that he doesn't want to go to—Olive laughed. “Well. I’m going, too.""""At least there’s that.""
Or when Anh forces Olive to put sunscreen on Adam because that's what a 'good girlfriend would do'—""God. The sunscreen.""“Yeah.” His voice sounded muffled from down here. “Yeah, that was . . .”“Awkward?” she offered, sitting back straight with a grimace. Adam was looking elsewhere. She was probably imagining it, the way he was flushing.He cleared his throat. “Among other things.”→Not my boy Adam getting flustered by a rub down 😌Okay there's only one sex scene in this, but it was kinda hot and cute. Like it was messy, but also it had me fanning myself at times and KID YOU NOT, I teared up during one paragraph...because damn couldn't be me 😔“Because you don’t want it, right? Maybe I’m just not attractive to you and you don’t want this—”It nearly made her lose her balance, the way he tugged at her wrist and pulled her hand to himself, pressing her palm flush to his groin to show her that . . .His jaw rolled as he held her gaze. “You have no fucking idea what I want.”
All y'all already know I have the mention the line that literally everyone is talking about—“You’re so big.”He groaned into her neck. His entire body was vibrating with tension. “You can take it.”
Just the way Adam encourages Olive is the sweetest thing ever. Since Olive gets insecure and unsure of herself very easily, Adam is always there to make sure she knows that she is worth it. Then, his protectiveness of her 😩 the way he should just drop anything he was doing, just for her was so perfect—“I’m going to kill you,” he gritted out, little more than a growl. “If you say another word about the woman I love, if you look at her, if you even think about her—I’m going to fucking kill you.”
Anyway, thought I’d note that Adam Driver is constantly on my mind *sigh* 🥲Edit: Soooo the author released a chapter in Adam's POV and this man was fucking WHIPPED to the maxShe smiles at him, happy, hopeful, beautiful and says, “Hey.”Adam smiles, too, and thinks, This is it. He thinks, I love you. He thinks, Maybe, one day, you’ll even let me tell you.And he says, “Hey.”I'm such a whore for Adam Driver so I'll leave you with this 🛐—"

1576,5.0,"This is the best book i’ve ever read. I’m about to make it my entire personality and everybody else’s problem😌I absolutely LOVED this romcom. The Love Hypothesis follows graduate student Olive navigate love and being a woman in STEM. When her bets friend falls HARD for the guy Olive was dating, Olive decides to find a man to fake date, so that her best friend believes she's truly over Jeremy and gets together with him. When Olive kisses a man she later finds out if a professor at her school in front of her best friend, they find themselves in a mutually beneficial fake relationship.This book is trope-y, but very self aware. The narrator is familiar with the rom-com genre, and constantly cracks at the hilarity of their unrealistic situation. The love interest, on the other hand, is not familiar with... pretty much anything pop culture and you can watch him fall in love with her in real time. His lack of self-awareness definitely lends itself to how quickly his feelings for her develop.The chemistry between our two leads is /absolutely everything./ Theres miscommunication, which definitely isn't usually for me, but I didn't mind it too much in this book because the angst that comes out of it is so electric. Watching them fall for each other while vehemently denying the other returns feelings is super fun to read.Now.. I technically read this book for the first time about three years ago. This book was originally published as a fanfiction (Head Over Feet on AO3) and it took me over half the book to realize! It felt.. very familiar but at the same time improved from the original. Head Over Feet has always been one of the most popular works in the Star Wars fandom, and the original was fantastic, but The Love Hypothesis is definitely a step up. If you were unfamiliar with the original characters and fandom tropes from this universe, you would have no clue this was written originally as a fanfiction.Overall, I think this book is outstanding. Maybe I'm a little biased because I was technically mentioned in the acknowledgements😏😏 but I absolutely loved everything about it. If you're looking for a book about women in STEM, a fun romcom with charismatic leads, of if you just want to delve back into 2018-era Star Wars fandom, this book is for you :))If you've ever seen the Star Wars Sequel Trilogy, it's basically all the characters but with name swaps. Finn and Poe are gay in this book, which should've been canon in the movies🙄 Rose is bi if I remember right? Ben and Rey are the main characters. Hux and Snoke also make appearances in their typically antagonistic fashion.*important note: the love interest has never been and never will be the professor of the main character. He just works at her graduate school. So... technically a teacher-student trope, but without the gross power imbalances."
1577,4.0,"4.5 stars TW: sexual harassment; mentions of death of a parent This was an unexpected surprise. I was hesitant to read this since the author was pretty big in the Star Wars fanfic scene and I’ve had not great luck with other big fandom authors. But, aside from a few nods, this definitely stood alone as original work and I appreciate it. The slow burn here was excellent and I really enjoyed the characters. While there were a few romance tropes here I didn’t enjoy (over emphasis on how large of a person he is in contrast to how small she is; characters being so oblivious it’s painful), I overall adored this. There were a few bits at the very end that I felt were a little over the top, which combined with the mentioned tropes kept it from being 5 stars. But if you like fake dating and slow burn, this is for you. "

1582,4.0,"4.5*What a fun sweet rom-com. Definitely one of my favorites for this year!Olive Smith is working on her Ph.D. With little to her name and only a couple of close friends, all her time is devoted to lab work. But when Olive tries to ensure her friend Anh that she has no interest in Jeremy, Anh won’t believe her. Leaving Olive no choice but to take drastic measures. She grabs the first man she sees in the hall outside the lab and kisses him! This way Anh will see that Olive has a completely different love interest.But the man she ends up kissing is one of the professors known for his grumpiness and bad attitude! Great! There goes Olive’s career in science!🤦🏻‍♀️But an idea forms that maybe they can help each other by entering a “fake relationship”.I loved Olive and how she always puts everyone before herself. She was a lonely young woman with a heart of gold.I even warmed up to Adam. The tall dark and brooding professor. I think he’s just misunderstood!😜It is a spicy 🌶 🌶 rom-com!

I picked this up not expecting it to be this freaking GOOD. from start to finish this was captivating as hell, I LOVE the women in STEM story since I majored in biology that hit different fro me. Dr. Adam Carlsen.. wow, the perfect mix of grumpy, arrogant, sweet and hot as hell. Olive was one of my favorite heroines, I absolutely love when the female lead is a girl boss badass. Their banter and friendship was EVERYTHING. I LOVEEE the fake dating trope & the fact that Olive was aware of the trope made it even better. i cant recommend this enough.. EVERYONE GO READ THIS BOOK. & remember, “carry yourself with the confidence of a mediocre while man.” "

1588,3.0,"Did I enjoy it? Sure. I mean, it was fun and I guess it was kind of flirty at times? This was a solid 3 star read for me because whilst the story was highly entertaining and even amusing at times, the characters were pretty unimpressive? No offense but I didn’t fall head over heels for Adam and it sucks because this would’ve really impressed me years back but I feel like now? It’s not really original.The situations that the heroine got herself into and her friends put her in was very often just downright ridiculous and highly unlikely lol. I mean, a crowded 
lecture hall
 so she had to sit on his lap? Every moment from their first kiss to having too much sunscreen seemed almost forced to me and it made me roll my eyes hard at times.Im not going to talk about the writing because frankly I don’t care, I skipped a lot because of the info dumps and don’t really have the right to critise. This was also painfully tropey, with the student-teacher, one bed, grumpy-sunshine and fake dating and even boy falls first. HOWEVER, Adam was described as an asshole professor and that requirment was never met. He was grunty and grumpy but never an asshole though he was implied as an asshole for like a majority of the book
Adam Carlsen. Destroyer of research careers.
With alllll that being said, I still had fun while reading it. It was a quick and easy read and very easy to make it through without putting it down for other distractions.Totally recommend if you’re looking for a not-so-serious read that’s light and fluffy with just a hint of drama to make up for the overload of tropes.BUT THE SMUT.🤤🤤"
1589,1.0,"I read fanfic and while it's nice that it can now openly be turned into a novel there are so many things wrong with this mess that (imo) it makes fanfic look bad. To start with:1. This novel features a ""story"" that isn't one because the entire ""problem"" could have been solved if Adam and Rey, I mean Mary Sue, I mean Olive, had just had a conversation.2. Olive is supposed to be adorable (I assume) but mostly comes across as a hot mess of a doormat who needs Adam to fix herself and her life. (And that message? NO. Just NO.)3. Adam. Really? I suppose there's something to be said for acknowledging that this is a fanfic about Adam Driver but it's...well, more than a little weird to be paying to read such a thinly designed fevered sex dreamHaving said that, the author definitely knows how to write sex scenes. I can't see paying for this, as a03 has thousands of free novels just like this, but to each their own.Supposedly the cover art is by a Reylo fan artist. That sounds about right."

1592,4.0,"Pick this up if you enjoy: - Grumpy and sunshine- Fake dating- Slow burn- Cute romance and not much smut - there was 1 sceneWhat I loved:This was a fun and addictive read to switch off. It was light, cute, humorous and the characters were likeable. The academic STEM setting brought me back to my uni days! But, I clearly went to the wrong one because there were no young handsome professors playing sports shirtless LOL. All the scenes were so unrealistic, cheesy and cliche BUT I loved it because it allowed me to switch off and escape!What was missing: Adam and Olive's relationship was cute but I didn’t feel much fiery chemistry or tension between them, even in the awkward situations they got into. What I didn't enjoy:I did get a little annoyed with the continual use of the word fake. Fake dating, fake date, fake girlfriend, fake boyfriend, etc. I get it, its all fake! One thing that I did find weird was (view spoiler)[the reason why Olive had kept quiet after the incident with Tom. It would’ve made more sense if it was because she was scared to speak out, but to keep quiet because she didn’t want to affect Adam… what? (hide spoiler)]"
1593,5.0,"*5 stars*“I’m going to kill you,” he gritted out, little more than a growl. “If you say another word about the woman I love, if you look at her, if you even think about her - I’m going to fucking kill you.” This book was definitely worth the hype. It was a great, fast-paced read and now all I want to do is read it again. I enjoyed every moment. If you're debating whether you should read this book or not, stop debating and go read it."
1594,5.0,"This is a Fake-Dating Romance. Normally, I do not love books that takes place in a college/academic setting, so I have been putting off picking up this book. I cannot say how much I loved this book. I love the beginning so much. The characters was so great, and the two main characters where so great together. This book was cute and fun and a great read. I could not put this book down once I started reading it, so I ended up reading this book in one setting. This is everything I needed."
1595,1.0,"I knew I was in ""special book land"" when Olive mentioned befriending Ahn during an initial department meeting and them being the only ""non-cishet-white dude"" in the room. At Stanford. Just for kicks, I did a quick scan of the current crop of graduate students in biology at Stanford. Now, I know it's practically a federal offense to ascribe gender based on name/photo from a list, so I'm just going to say that ""white dude"" is not even a majority. Also, how the heck would Olive know who is cishet?!? Since fighting the dudes for resources is an ongoing theme in the story, I'm just going to assign this as some dystopian alt-history.And the story progresses okay for a bit. They're both lying liars with some pretty unhealthy relationship patterns, but I wanted to give it a chance to grow into itself. Plus, it was fun seeing Olive drift into like with Adam. And I completely sympathized with him as the guy demanding academic rigor and being labeled a jerk because of it. Look, science is hard enough just because it's mostly practiced by humans who make mistakes and draw faulty conclusions. Letting folks slide with sloppy research just because it makes them feel bad and extends their degree months or years longer is just stupid. Seriously, having Adam universally reviled because he's demanding about standards makes me want to slap people. Not that it isn't realistic. Which is why it drew me in. So I enjoyed seeing him revealed as a nice, kind guy willing to go way out of his way to help Olive.And it skates along pretty well until about the halfway point. That's when Olive realizes she has the feelz and we see a completely made-up non-motivation of ""people I care about always leave me"" develop. So I'm glad her friend Malcolm calls her out on it saying ""Hey, you think me and Ahn are temporary and going to leave you?"" Only. She just moves on with ""that's different."" And I'm supposed to take this seriously? It's not even that it's a negative motivation* (which it definitely is), so much as that it's just not interesting. It makes her seem silly. And insisting that she will lie to Adam about her feels was bad enough. But then he overhears her talking about how much she cares about him and she doubles down on the lie with the all-time-lame ""I wasn't talking about you"".So now she's making up some weasel story about some other dude and Adam's all like, ""oh. Sure"". completely crushed and she's oblivious. And now I hate everybody. I hate Olive for being an oblivious, scheming liar. I hate Adam for not having the self-respect of a wet paper towel. And I hate the author for pawning this off as a rom-com.And don't get me started on Olive being an asexual check-box poseur who just magically likes Adam ""in that way"" pretty much from the start. I dunno, I'm sure it can work that way for some. It just seems rather facile, here, like the author wanted asexual cred without bothering to learn anything about how that might work.So I'm done, though I know this is a somewhat cranky response. It's tone is light-enough that I'm probably not supposed to think this deeply about the setting and characters. On their surface, Adam and Olive are charming-enough. I just keep running aground on the surrounding details and am having a hard time letting that go.* Negative Motivations: I kind of hate that the term ""negative motivation"" isn't widespread, yet. Since it isn't, I'm going to save off this little jag to append to my reviews that feature the term. Jennifer Crusie blogged about it a bit back (or, if that link doesn't work, here's a cache of the original) and it changed how I understand story. The problem with the term is that if you've never heard it before, you'd assume it meant motivations that are harmful or immoral. Not so. What it refers to is motivations not to do something. The thing is that many of us are motivated to not do things for a lot of different, perfectly valid and reasonable, reasons. The problem is that in a story motivations to not do things are a huge drag on the plot—particularly considering the fact that most negative motivations are overcome by the character simply deciding they don't care any more (or, rather, that they do care and are now motivated to do the thing). So not only do you have a counter to action but you also have a situation where to overcome it, all a character has to do is change their mind. Which means eventually, the reader is rooting for the character to get over him/herself already and do the thing we want them to do. Conflict drives story. Conflict between a reader and a main character drives readers away from story."
1596,4.0,"4.25*This was such a fun read bringing fab rep to women in steam 🔥 *cough* I mean STEM written by a woman in STEM academia 🤭Kind of reminded me a bit of the Spanish Love Deception, but I much preferred this one as the MCs annoyed me considerably less altho Adam is possibly even more perfect than Superman (*ahem* Aaron Blackford in case you forgot his full name). I mean is Adam's character flaw that he cares too much about good science and pushes his grads by being hard on them? Also yes, my grinch is showing – does he have to be supposedly so hot, smart 
&
 ripped? I really don’t see why he had to be almost Hemsworth like – he sounded like he had plenty going for him without making him a god’like Adonis as well 🤔In saying that, I really enjoyed the interactions between Olive & Adam, they never failed to make me smile. Altho being of an age with Adam, I won’t pretend I didn’t grumble at Olive’s poking fun at his supposed ancient’ness…one does not become geriatric after 30…just sayin’ 😉 Also can he dislocate his jaw? If you’ve read this you know why I’m asking and am I alone in thinking that was not hot?!😵I found kinship with Olive, in that I too have never been bothered or driven to seek out romantic relationships 🤷 While admittedly not being immune to society’s brainwashing of what is an enticing beauty standard (what no, I’m not cynical) it is oddly surprising when a relationship you consider a friendship starts to morph and it’s hard to tell if it is reciprocated – although these two do manage to miss the boat on the feelz express for two such bright peeps 🤦 I am not mad at them eventho it is mild miscommunication and they are both still so respectful of the other that they are almost endearing in their dumb’ness when it comes to this. Also the fun romcom milestones this flies through while leaning in and acknowledging them – kudos Ali very well played 👍Unsurprisingly to anyone who has had the misfortune of reading one of my “reviews” before, I was HERE for the BFFs – I adored Malcolm & his unwavering support + fab advice to Olive. I was lowkey hoping the next book would be his, but I do not begrudge his happiness in this…I just wish we might have gotten more scenes like the pre-ending with the other BFF dynamic (A+H) was also amazingly supportive & I wanted more of them too! I may have found Anh a little pushy at times 🙈 I know it was because she wants the best for Olive but c’mon lady read the room or open space as the case may have been 🙄 I did adore reading about Anhs fight for more BIPOC accessibility in STEM and would probably have liked her more if we could have spent more time with her. One cannot fault their friendship tho considering the reason Olive got into her fake dating snafu with Adam was to help Anh find her HEA (altho did anyone else side eye Jeremy for his big mouth?) & she has offered to marry Olive if ever her being Canadian causes visa issues #goals Her immediate support alongside Malcolm after the conference brought her back up in my estimation, I think had we just seen more of her without the “pushiness” I’d deffo have liked her more as she sounds like a great friend from what Olive says…but with Malcolm we got to see more on page interactions and that's why he gets #1 billing & 🤩I loved getting a peek behind the curtain at Grad School life and the struggles being a poor grad student brings alongside the stress over funding, experiments & controls etc, I liked science at school but have always been a very lazy student so never got to experience it at higher education – language labs are a very different kettle of fish tho 🤪Tom made me want to scream, not only because it was obvious where that storyline was heading – but also the fact that this probably happens all too often is infuriating on every level 🤬Woops, I thought I would struggle to “talk” about this book, anyways am off to reread quickly before my library loan expires as yes, despite how this “review” might sound - I did like it and after the sneak peek at the next book am curious to see what this author does next as well as obvs NASA 🙃 (but why does the brief mention of the guy already make me annoyed as he sounds like he’s prob going to be another Adonis type...honestly there's plenty sexy about guys who aren't all hard muscles 😖😬)PS - loved the little hypothesis(es?) at the start of each chapter, they were such fun 🤗PPS - expired contacts lenses are the pits and really do sting, there's a reason I count myself lucky to have been able to change to dailies 👀Downside tho is I guess there'll be no blind meet cute for me eh...pity 😊"

""It hit her then what was so special about Adam. That no matter his reputation, or how rocky their first meeting, since the very beginning, Olive had felt that he was on her side. Over and over, and in ways that she could never have anticipated, he had made her feel unjudged. Less alone.""
I absolutely blew through this book. I was actually terrified that I wasn't going to like it, based on how most hyper anticipated contemporary romances never live up to your expectations (*cough cough* The Spanish Love Deception).But this book got everything right.❤ fake dating!❤ chemistry af❤ grumpy one and a snarky but sunshine one❤ mutual pining❤ forced close quarters❤ great banter❤ fake! dating!!!I loved Olive. I loved Adam. I loved them separately and together. I couldn't help but draw comparisons to TLSD while I was reading for some reason and this book succeeded in a lot of ways that the other decidedly did not. And one shining example of that were the sex scenes. When Adam gets down to it (pun intended), he doesn't lose his personality. When he starts talking, it feels very much like a reveal. Like ✨tadaaaa Adam is secretly super sexy underneath all that brooding✨ without it feeling out of left field. Also tell me a pet name/ term of endearment better than ""smart-ass"". We're so lucky. After a year of hearing ""baby"" (used poorly) ""buddy"" and all manner of stupid shit, smart-ass killed me dead..5 stars off though for the warp speed wrap up of an ending. *ahem* attention all contemporary writers! I don't know if this slipped your notice at some point, but us romance readers are, shockingly, in it for the romance. I wanna see the couple actually together. I don't want to infer what happens after ""I love you"". We're specifically here to see that shit!!! Why are you holding out on me?!?"
1598,4.0,"I want more Women in STEM books and academia rom-coms are my new favourite. This book single handedly crushed so many tropes, it was a delight, the tongue in the cheek humor, the constant gloom of feeling incompetent in college, the struggles of the student life. I related to all of them so much. I loved Adam and Olive, their relationship and the banter was so smooth. Adam with his weird, deadpan humor and Olive with her trope loving self. She was so self aware as a romance lead and there were some lines she threw out that had me lmaoo. Ultimately, I feel like everything added up and I had such a good time reading this. I do however feel like her meddlesome bestie Anh took the cringe moments to next level. I wanted to scream LEAVE THEM ALONE, ANH and JUST ADMIT IT, YOU FOOLS, so many times. 😂😂They were so cute together ❤️ Also, I loved that Olive had a life outside the sphere of the hero. She wasn't all about him. This made me like the romance so much.Can we also talk about how freaking cute Malcolm and Haldon were?! AHHH 🥰4/5"
1599,5.0,"Omg did I love this! Helen Hoang meets Mariana Zapata (high praise in my book) in this academia-centered slow burn rom com that was the cutest thing ever. The pacing? Perfect. The banter? Perfect. The tropes? Perfect. The sex? Perfect. Sigh. I can’t express how much I loved Olive and Adam. This follows a Ph.D. student (women in STEM, don’t ya know!) who stumbles into a fake dating situation with a professor and obviously falls in love. I honestly adored every second of this book. The relationship was paced so well and I fell in love with both characters so fast that I was swooning along with them. Amazing representation on all accounts, the industry, sexuality, race, societal issues, gender norms without it ever feeling heavy handed. This is easily one of my top books of the year and I can’t wait for it to come out so I can stare at it lovingly on my shelf!"
1600,5.0,"Oh gosh, there aren't words to describe how much I adored this book. As in, this, alongside of 'A Dangerous Kind of Lady' by Mia Vincy, both of which I read this year, might qualify as my top two of all time. My heart melted into a puddle over and over again, so much that I'm not quite sure how to return to normal. What a high.Olive. Let's start with her. She's absolutely precious on every level, and a protagonist I think most will relate too. She's nervous, awkward, shy, completely self deprecating and self conscious, but lively and funny and ahhhh. Adorable. Most of all, though, a demisexual character on page was a big deal for me, something I completely relate to (for those who don't know, it means being generally unable to feel or form attraction to someone unless you form an emotional bond). Not that it's a thing that's the same for everyone, but I very much related to Olive on that front. And Adam, for his part, was not what I expected. The synopsis touts him as an asshole, which ok yes, he is. Except also he isn't, and not around Olive. His tenderness towards her over and over is what did me in.But this book is not without tension. I'm not going to recount the summary here, but I can say the fake dating situation very much felt like a will they-wont they, as in, every moment that they aren't wrapped up in each other feels like DYING. You can see how hard they've fallen for each other, early on especially, but there's so many false assumptions, complex situations, and wrenches thrown in their way that UGH it left me panting. But trust me, in the process of them getting together, there's plenty to keep you satiated. Banter, flirting, sparks exploding. I also have to nod to the writing, which was genius, the issues this book tackled (women in STEM especially), and the absolutely adorable and loving best friends that surround Olive even when she felt most alone. Again - my heart."

1602,5.0,"Olive Smith has a problem: she needs to convince her best friend Anh that she isn’t into Anh’s crush Jeremy. Her solution? Fake date the grumpy and mysterious professor Adam Carlsen. Olive is shocked when Adam goes along with her fake dating plan, but he seems to have his own reasons for needing to fake date someone. The only thing left to do is not fall for the person you are fake dating…I’m so blown away by this book, I can hardly believe it’s a debut novel. And, it mixed two tropes together almost perfect with faking dating and grumpy hero/sunshine heroine. I’m actually kind of kicking myself for not reading this book the moment it hit my kindle. I read somewhere that this book was Reylo fanfic and while I am not a huge shipper of that duo, I can see how those characters inspired this book. Adam in the book was well, Adam Driver, and Olive was Daisy Ridley in my mind. I loved the dynamic between Adam and Olive, I’m a sucker for when the hero is a jerk to everyone but the heroine and this book was stuffed to the gills with that. In addition to that, this book had some pretty decent character development that I appreciated, both Olive and Adam helped the other one grow and become a better version of themselves, even while fake dating. Absolutely loved this book, it came to me right at the perfect time during a horrible book slump, and now the only thing to do is wait very impatiently for another book by Ali Hazelwood to come along.

1603,4.0,"This is pretty much your average romance and in any other day I probably would’ve hated it but I was in a reading slump and this made me feel ✨things✨ and apparently, I have a thing for Adam Carlsen now (altho he has zero personality other than being the white dude that respectfully pines and is willing to kill for our heroine, wish he had a little angst going for him other than the pining but honestly i stan). Yeah, this made me cringe but it’s an awesome read (and it sent me to a romance binge which definitely placed a momentary halt to my months-long thriller binge but hey, it's cool).PS.I did really love this book, I do, although two things bothered me: (1) the unprofessionalism **coughs in PDA** is genuinely making me want the ground to swallow me whole for the heroine cuz holy shit, and (2) the thing between Holden and what's his name kind of feels like... token gay couple? thingy?? I dunno, I probably shouldn't have said that- but yeah, it kind of comes across like that. Although in hindsight, I actually found the double date hilarious. That was fun, but yeah."
1604,3.0,"There are many things I hate in contemporary romance novels:-Overbearing friends/relatives-Manic Pixie Dream Girls-Present tense-Dual first person POV-The third act breakup-The reconciliation due to an accident, an act of heroism, a cliche grand gesture like catching the love interest before they leave for a flight.-Love triangles that aren't really triangles.-Uneven pacing.-Poorly written smut.-Saturation of superficial referencesThis book has nearly all of them. Olive is definitely a manic pixie dream girl but this time she's speshu because she's in STEM. I'm glad the book stuck to one POV but Olive was so boring and one dimensional that I almost wished for the point of view of an errant gadfly just to break from the monotony because this girl is not funny. She's repetitive. And the extent of her personality is that she likes stereotypical white girl insta food. Adam, honey, use a thesaurus- there are other juvenile insults other than smart-arse. Adam was also very one-dimensional. Did you know that he is built and grumpy and a hard ass. This book desperately tries to Miranda Priestley him but this devil missed the bus and was just dull. There was also descriptions that had me befuddled. See, when I look at a jaw, I know it can clench and chew. But I've no idea how it can roll as a form of expression because I only roll my jaw after I yawn so hard I cracked it. In addition to having poorly crafted drama. I mean, the thing with Tom and Holden saying he doesn't trust him... Chekhov's Tom was so unsubtle they may as well have called this book Tom's bullshit and Adam threatens to kill him. One more thing, I just realised this also fails miserably at being a good fake dating book because it's quite obvious, to everyone but Olive, that Adam knew her from before and was always into her. And then he never told her that he'd always had feelings for her. Because... Nobody knows. Their relationship isn't unethical so there was really no reason why he never said anything. Romance novels don't have to be literary masterpieces. But when they are riddled with cliches, have dead tropes and a main narrator suffering from a severe lack of personality, it's entirely unforgivable that this book is BORING."
1605,5.0,"Thank you Mae for constantly reminding me to read this one. I promised Mae that I was finally going to pick this up after finishing the new Katee Robert book and hello? I did. And wow. Oh, wow. The Love Hypothesis is a treasure, a highlight of my year, one book I won't ever forget. I now have the urge to constantly reread it. Adam and Olive were spectacular main characters I loved very, very much.The story starts with Olive kissing a stranger because she needs to make her best friend know that it's okay to date Olive's ex-fling. Olive didn't even like him! But she still doesn't believe her so Olive decides to show her that she has moved on... and that's why we find her kissing a stranger one night at school. But he is no stranger tho! This mysterious man is none other than Adam Carlsen, grumpy, hates everyone, Adam. Ooops....She thinks that she just completely messed up but unexpectedly Adams follows along and now everyone thinks they're dating, so yeah, they tell everyone they're dating which of course they aren't lmao. But oh my god this book, this romance, the way it starts? Everything is perfection. I had such a good time reading this book. I seriously couldn't stop reading it since the very first page, I needed to continue turning the pages, wanting to know what was going to happen to Adam and Olive.We have a romance hero who is obsessed with his love interest. Adam has loved Olive for years and has never said a word. And now !!! They're fake dating and it's like the world gave him a chance and he is literally so happy to be here with her. He's so tired of other people, he does not care about anyone else but her. HE IS ONLY SOFT AND SWEET WITH HER. He smiles and he wants to constantly touch her. Adam Carlsen *sighs in love* you are one of a kind, my dude. This is also definitely grumpy/sunshine, she eats lots of sugary cakes and drinks while he prefers everything to be without sugar and he takes his coffee black please. They're so opposite of each other, but they work together so well. Literally everyone tells them ""wow you love each other so much"" and Olive is like ??? what??? love??? But they gazing each other is so CLEARRRR that everyone sees it too, that they are crazy for each other.Sorry this review went for so long but I just wanted to express my undying love for this book. Highly recommend everyone to have this in your lists. Get it as soon as you see it available. Read it as soon as you have time to do it. You won't regret it. This book is going to be in many, many end of the year lists of favorites of 2021. I AM SURE."

I wish you could see yourself the way I see you.""

Interestingly enough, I avoided reading this book due to the hype around it. It's so rare that I see a highly hyped up book that I end up loving. But the cover was so dang cute and the blurb sounded so good, that I decided to cave and take the chance. Sadly, reality won out, and I ended up feeling like I read a different book from everyone else. Such is my life. *Deep sigh*It started out so strong. I was immediately hooked by the quirky and awkward Olive and the super grumpy professor Adam Carlsen. I love me a good fake dating trope, so there was that going for it. And quite honestly, I was riveted to the pages for the first 20% of the story, with a goofy smile on my face thinking I've found the book. Sadly though, that giddy feeling didn't last for me. And while I didn't necessarily dislike it, I just didn't love it either. For me, it felt like a book a novice romance reader who's just dipping their toe in the genre might enjoy. Now take that with a grain of salt. This is coming from someone that generally just doesn't gravitate towards cute contemporaries, so this could very well have been the case of just me. And going off of reviews and just how many absolutely adored this book, I definitely feel like the black sheep here. But alas, it is what it is.So let's go with a good ole' feedback sandwich here. I loved the STEM representation and the way it was written. I was afraid that the academia and science aspect of the story would bore me to death, but the author wrote it in such a way that it added to the story and kept even non academia readers engaged. I loved that about this. I also loved the trope and the quirky heroine meet grumpy professor aspect.What was missing for me was the chemistry. I just didn't feel it between these two. This is very much a slow burn, but the more time these two spent together, the less I felt it. The way they were thrown together into awkward situations by Olive's friend Ahn, the more it felt that way...awkward. I also struggled with the way it was written. It was third person POV in Olive's perspective, but it read like it should have been first person, if that makes sense. I still struggle to have a visual in my head on what Olive or any of the secondary characters looked like, there was almost no physical descriptions of them. As it was, all of the secondary characters just came across flat, rudimentary, and two dimensional. And it didn't take long before the main characters came across that way too.I did enjoy the ending and seeing Olive finally, FINALLY, stand up for herself and truly show growth as a character. I also loved seeing Adam's fuzzy and soft side. There was some steam at the end that added, though not much for me, to the chemistry. Don't get me wrong, I don't need steam to enjoy a book. But when the chemistry is already lagging for me, it just felt super lacking here.So did I dislike it? No. Did I love it? Also no. Would I recommend it? Sure! It's a cute, slow burn romance that I think plenty would love. I just wish I was one of them. So while it was an enjoyable read, it also won't be anything I remember or come back to after finishing.ARC courtesy of publisher in exchange for an honest reviewFind me on:  "

“Olive,” Dr. Aslan interrupted her with a stern tone. “What do I always tell you?” “Um . . . ‘Don’t misplace the multichannel pipette’?” “The other thing.” She sighed. “ ‘Carry yourself with the confidence of a mediocre white man.’ ”
Oh my god, I literally sped through this book who gave it the right to be that addicting and easy to read?? And so many good tropes wow.
⇢The Plot
This book had such a good balance of plot and romance development for a contemporary romance. Honestly the perfect ratio for me. We got to see the characters grow and achieve their goals all the while their relationship (or fake relationship) was growing too and the pacing was just so well done. I have to say the ending of the book felt a bit abrupt and I would have liked to see a bit more of what happened after the Tom situation and after Olive told Adam the truth at the end, but that’s just me nitpicking and wanting more cute scenes LOL. Anyway, aside from the few times that the pacing felt off, no complaints in regards to the plot. 
⇢Olive and Adam
As I basically said before, Olive and Adam = adorable. They had so many good trope scenes and despite this book being so new the lap-sitting scene is already iconic, as it should be. 
""What does it really say?"" Adam asked when they were finally alone.Olive handed him the crumpled paper and remained silent as he angled it to read it in the lamplight. She wasn't surprised when she saw a muscle jump in his jaw, or when he slid the fortune into the pocket of his jeans. She knew what it said, after all.You can fall in love: someone will catch you.”
Just with like the plot I felt like their relationship status moved kinda weirdly at times (although maybe that’s just because so many romance books follow a strict timeline) but the sheer cuteness honestly made up for it. 
“He’d clearly never seen a rom-com or read a romance novel in his life.”
^ Also, loved all of the trope references Olive made in comparison to their relationship. It was hilarious to have a main character be so self-aware.

There was more tell than show. I couldn’t care less about all the academia plot. The setup for the fake dating was just ridiculous for two grown-up adults. And some scenes were just too unrealistic. It may get better. It may turn out being a cute read after all. I don’t know! I just don’t care. I’m not in the mood to push myself through a book just so everyone else is saying it’s amazing. It isn’t! But if there is a lesson I’ve leaned over the years I’m on bookstagram is to never trust the hype. DNF at 40%."
1614,5.0,"I don’t read a lot of rom-coms and I promised myself that I would read more this year! I went into The Love Hypothesis by Ali Hazelwood totally blind. I loved the cover and knew I had to read it and I thoroughly enjoyed it! What a great debut novel!! I absolutely loved everything about these geeky characters. The fake relationship trope between two STEM nerds was a new one for me and it was perfection! The fun and witty banter between Adam, the grumpy professor and Olive, the sweet and smart student created a nice slow buildup between the two until the sparks started to fly! I now want to be best friends with Olive and have my own fake coffee date with a handsome professor at Starbucks every Wednesday and discuss all things pumpkin spice!! I guess you’ll have to read it to see what I’m talking about. I highly recommend this fun, quirky, relatable, and over-to-quick rom-com!! "
1615,5.0,RTC after I buy and re-read the paper version but ALL THE STARS TO THIS DEBUT THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A DEBUT IN ANY WAY HOW DID IT GIVE ME EVERYTHING I WANTED AND ALSO EVERYTHING I DIDN'T KNOW I WANTED???? Also yay for a demisexual heroine.
1616,4.0,"The Love Hypothesis is smart and sweet. It’s a cute story about 2 scientists at Stanford, one a Ph.D. student and one a professor, committed to their research and wary of love, but in agreement to keep up a fake charade of dating, each for their own reasons. Will Olive and Adam succeed or will this experiment go awry? I enjoyed this story from the start and thought Olive was a great character. She had to endure a lot as a woman in STEM. While I have no direct experience in that space myself, I could still relate to her moments of self doubt and I was rooting for her."
1617,4.0,"I'm trash for fake dating tropes so throw in this mix two equally smart people with absolutely zero skills at dating or flirting, add in a pinch of love unrequited and you get the loveliest, cutest, awkward, sexy romance. Also: meddling friends. Yes to pushy friends.And YES to Reylo fanfics. I mean, reading this and hearing Adam dialogues in Adam Driver's quiet, clipped voice? Yassss.It could have been a 5 stars for me but... miscommunication, GUYS. Ugh.Review to come.——————————I had resigned myself to live a bleak and austere life until the release of this book... NO MORE! It's here! On me kindle!! (Thanks to the publisher for the early copy.)

...she loved him even more for it. For looking at her like she was the beginning and end of his every thought.
You can read a more detailed review on my blog.Before I start my review, this is a message to all my women in academia: Carry yourself with the confidence of a mediocre white man. Now on to the review.I have finally slept on it and gathered my thoughts into a coherent review (at least I hope so). I heard about this book a month ago on TikTok and I was anxiously waiting for it to release and I finally managed to get my greedy little paws on it and read it in two days. And wow... I knew I was going to like it, but man, I did not think that I would enjoy it this much. By the time I finished the book, my face hurt from so much smiling. It was wholesome, (with spice), and beautiful.The story starts with Olive kissing an antagonistic and unapproachable professor under the disguise of dating him, and thus, the fake dating begins. And let me tell you...it was perfect. Olive and Adam are the kind of book/movie couple that you root for since the first time you see them together on page/screen. The little moments that they share that make them fall for each other are just so cute (it makes you contemplate your own romantic life).What I absolutely love about this book is the fact that the author also focuses on Olive as an academic and acknowledges her personality out of Adam. We also see the difficulty of being a woman in an academic environment and how people can abuse their power. Hazelwood touches on these topics and also reassures her readers that the path will be difficult but oh so worth it in the end.The only thing that I may have some beef with is the fact that this book kept calling me out: 
""...because my self-worth is unbreakably tied to my academic performance.""
 Really, Ali? I just wanted to read a nice story and you called tf out of my praise starved ass. Not cool.I will recommend this book until the day I die.~ 5 starsMy initial thoughts:Wow... I am in love with this book. I cannot form words to describe how amazing it is and how much fun I had reading it. I need to sleep on it and write an actual review. My 5 stars remain."

I’m crazy about it! I even read this during our exam week, and to tell you the truth. . . the amount of time I dedicated to reading this novel in comparison to my prelim notes is HILARIOUS.

1626,3.0,"I'm still very confused about this book : while i loved the whole setting of the story and the representation of women in STEM (yay), i think that the more 🌶spicy🌶 scenes were not really well written nor articulated. The whole fake dating thing (up to like 60% of the book) : chef's kiss, perfect The last 40% : not really my thing and a bit disappointing if i'm being honest ... Merged review:no one hates themselves as much as Adam does ... and you know what, same :)"
1627,5.0,"✨This book is the reason I walk around my college campus looking for hot nerds to fall in love with and then immediately get disappointed 😭✨I am sure you guys have heard countless praise for this book. I am here to add to that hype. This book really is just that good 😍Is it possible to give a book infinte stars? If so, that's what this book gets. You know that moment when you find a new favorite, you just stand there, your heart swelling and aching all at the same time? This book makes me feel that way ❤️❤️Tropes: 👫🏻 fake dating🥺 pining 🗣 BANTER☺️ ‘I hate everyone but you’ 🧠 competency kink (two people who truly understand and challenge each other intellectually) 💋 hero falls in love first ☀️ grump/sunshine 👀 “we have to kiss in front of everyone” + tension😩 slow burn 🥼 two nerds falling in love 🛏 only one bed 🥵 consent is hot 👩🏻‍🔬 heroine in STEMThis book is jam packed with everything I love. I truly cannot ask for more. How do I put into words how much I love this book? The feeling of seeing yourself in a book is absolutely unmatched. As a woman in STEM, Olive getting her HEA and being a badass, smart, independent woman made me practically tear up. In books, we are so used to seeing women get defined as badass when they are hyper-masculine, cold, not-interested in relationships, etc. and not that those women are not badass but sometimes they just reek of the male gaze. Olive is a glowing example of how you can be badass, accomplished, and determined while being kind a person, while allowing herself to cry, while being head over heels in love with a hottie PhD professor. It's books like these that touch my heart and become favorites. The characters were amazing 😍 The hero had me swooning and searching for a sexy PhD man of my own. Adam is definitely book husband material 😏The moments where Adam showed his true self or was so clearly pining for Olive sent my heart into a flurry 🥺 Those moments where they would have their sizzling banter and a small smile would ghost his lips? I was GONE. Adam was so supportive and loving. He always saw her for who she was and saw all of her potential. Olive is so lucky. I would do anything to have an Adam of my own. They had so much chemistry. Physical, emotional, and intellectual! Where do I sign up for my own cute nerd romance?! 😩😩It honestly felt like Ali reached into my mind and pulled out all of the scenes my subconscious wanted and gave them to me. The sunscreen scene 🥵 ifykyk. I was getting all of these beautiful, full-of-tension romantic scenes and I was having an absolute BLAST. This book really has me in a chokehold with how enamored I am with it. Olive’s sexuality was written beautifully. I was floored by how seamless and emotional her development into having s*x with Adam was. Stories and characters like these are so important and so refreshing in a genre full of books that deal with sexuality so nonchalantly (not that there is an issue with that!). The plot was so wonderfully developed. If you read the fanfic, then you would know that the story was originally just a collection of scenes. Now Ali has created a seamless plot that had me on the edge of my seat. The villain had me seething! Especially since I see people like him every day (going to a competitive, STEM orientated college myself). I couldn’t have asked for more 😍I am so beyond grateful that I got to read, review, and promote this book early. This book is an absolute fave of all time. If you know me, then you know that I am a wh*re for the competency kink. When two characters just match each other intellectualy and can keep up with each other's mind, I LOOSE it. Ali gave me all of that goodness. Her next, upcoming work is an anthology with intellectual rivalries. nerds falling in love, extreme tension, and more! I am so so so excited. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/ 5 stars | 🌶🌶.5/ 5 steamThank you to Berkley, Ali Hazlewood, and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for my honest opinion ❤️"

Def was frustrated about the third act but I got over it. I did want a little more from the ending but loved it all the same. The banter, the plot, the science!!! Overall a very cute romance read xx-Christine "
1631,5.0,4.75THAT WAS FUCKING ADORABLE!
1632,5.0,"Slow burn, nerdy romance with fake dating and a demi-sexual heroine! The Love Hypothesis was a really fantastic debut and I think this is going to be a real crowd-pleaser. The romance is great and does a nice job of addressing issues of power dynamics, which is important since this is between a professor and a graduate student, but not HIS graduate student! We also get some exploration of women in STEM, BIPOC women in STEM, issues with professors stealing their students work without credit, and sexual harassment in academia. All of which are very real issues and it's clear the author is entrenched in this world. (my husband is a professor & research scientist, so I'm very familiar by proxy) Overall, a really great romance that takes it's time, but gets pretty damn steamy by the end. I'll be looking for more from this author! The audiobook is great as well and I received an audio copy for review from the publisher. All opinions are my own. "
1633,5.0,"This book checked all of my boxes and was an absolute joy to read. It was adorkably wonderful and gave my heart all the flutters and swoops that I love to feel. The Love Hypothesis combined so many of my favorite tropes like fake dating, ""I hate everyone but you"", slow burn enemies to friends to lovers, etc, and leaned into them so perfectly. All the pining and longing had my heart beating so fast and every loaded glance and near touch had me swooning. I'm always a sucker for those thoughtful little gestures and gifts that slowly add up, and The Love Hypothesis had them in spades. I adored Adam and Olive and their chemistry and the build up between them was so well done. I nearly combusted when things finally boiled over *bites fist* and I'm honestly still fanning myself. I loved all the aspects of their friendship and relationship because they connected on so many levels. The banter between them, as well as all their friends, was hilarious and I laughed so hard. I loved that they all gave as good as they got.In addition to loving Olive and Adam, I adored the secondary characters just as much (well, besides a certain ""good friend"", but even he played his role so vilely). Anh and Malcolm are the ride or dies that we all want and need in our lives. Their found family was a highlight of the book for sure. The Love Hypothesis is definitely one of my favorite reads of 2021 (and ever!) and I can't wait to read what Ali Hazelwood writes next!CW: cancer, death of parent, bullying, sexual harassment*I voluntarily read an advance review copy of this book*"
1634,3.0,"3 Stars!Alright, I know most of you adored this book and I can totally see that, but don't come @ me for saying this; I think this was a little overhyped! #sorrynotsorryI did enjoy reading this, it was very quick and cute read, I even caught myself smiling at some parts.(and that's saying a lot coming from a cynical person) But the book itself was cliché on top of cliché. So, this book was a CLICHÉ GALORE!However, this may not seem the most sunshine-filled review, but I did like this book as an overall and I'm looking forward to the author's next books!"
1635,5.0,10 stars! One of my favorite books of the year! Review to come. It seriously doesn’t get better than this. ❤️
1636,5.0,"HONESTLY, I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS BOOK MY WHOLE LIFE !!!OMG ! Everything about this book is PERFECT ! Literally , PERFECTION !I loved all of it ( The main and side characters , Plot , Tropes ,love story , chemistry , Setting , Words , Writing style ) EVERYTHING . Before I dive deep into my review, I have 4 words for you, my dear reader : GO.READ. THIS.NOVEL I'm sure you will find it captivating , entertaining , funny , emotional , smart , sexy and super romantic .   "" You can fall in love ; someone will catch you "" I've already read the blurb months ago and honestly , I was SO EXCITED to read this story . When I received the ARC two days ago , I was over the moon . Started reading the book directly and didn't leave my kindle until I finished the WHOLE book , I just physically and emotionally couldn't leave the characters even to eat . LOL . I've been always a fast reader, but this time , I surpassed myself with how fast I devoured this novel. If you are a lover of "" Fake relationship "" Trope , then this story will be perfect for you . Especially with Hazelwood's writing style , humour and witty dialogues . Her words made the reading experience 100% better . With her knowledge and experiences in the Academia field , she added a degree of realistic element to the story. For me , I enjoyed that element the most ( particularly because of my involvement in the field of research - specifically medical research- , I was able to get the inside jocks and every scientific reference , which was GLORIOUS . I've never felt represented in a romance novel I read before as much as I felt in this BRILLIANT novel ) . I won't say much about the main couple , as everything about them and their story was perfect . I loved their personalities , backstories , connection , chemistry , emotional development , witty and smart discussions . Their love story was the ideal combination between tenderness , hotness ( You just wait until you read chapter 16 😉😛🤐 ) academia and science . The side characters added an amazing dimension and entertaining element to the book . I LOVED each one of them . Furthermore, I really wished there was MORE TO READ .I'm definitely going to check out every future release by Ali Hazelwood . She is my NEW FAVOURITE Romance Author Highly . Highly recommend this book for every romance lovers . If you are a fan of the ( Hating Game ) and ( The Spanish love deception ), you can NOT miss this one , You will get the same vibes and MORE.  Huge thanks to Penguin Random House international for sending me an E-ARC through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own. @PRHGlobal #partner "
1637,5.0,"The Love Hypothesis lives up to all the positive reviews. This book has every check list of contemporary rom com should be. What I enjoyed the most is the smart banter. I love Adam. He is such a sweetheart. And Olive is my hero. I can relate to Olive. How she feels when she was harrased and abused by her male colleage. Miss Hazelwood paints a realistic picture in the era of #metoo movement. You guys, please go read this book.5 stars"
1638,5.0,"Okay, The Love Hypothesis is THAT rom com book of the year! It was entertaining, cute, laugh out loud funny, steamy, and even mentioned deep issues that had you feeling all the feels. The two main characters were absolutely everything I have ever wanted. The arrogant professor who is cruel and wholesome at the same time, I am in love with Adam. We also have Olive who is witty and just full of fun.I mean it when this book was laugh out loud funny. The whole fake dating was so wholesome and the slow burn witty banter was just perfection. Adam not loving chocolate, his favorite color being black, and being scared of needles absolutely made this just so good, especially when Olive is the exact opposite. What really made me fall head over heels for this book were all the little moments Adam and Olive had together. If you’ve read this, the part with the chocolate covered granola bar made me swoon about Adam.I honestly don’t have any coherent thoughts about this book besides it was phenomenal and one of the best rom-coms ever written. Like, the hype is real surrounding this book and if you haven’t read it… did I convince you to go read it asap?"
1639,5.0,"5 stars. Romantic, thoughtful, and at its core, a love letter to academia: The Love Hypothesis is every bit as good as the hype would have you believe and more. "
1640,4.0,I thought this was a solid fun read! I just don't like the fake dating trope at all but I loved our stoic starchy hero and our vulnerable and brilliant heroine who loves her work so so so much. I also felt uncomfy with the conflict. It's just not my fave topic for conflict even though it's prevalent in the work place. Especially in a male dominated work place.
1641,5.0,"“carry the confidence of a mediocre white man”— the love hypothesisabsolutely love the representation of women in STEM! as a part of the aforementioned community, i felt extremely relatable and seen. dr. adam is a whole dream with his ""grumpy"" persona and magic truck-moving hands. even the side characters had their own personality other than being cardboard cutouts of the protagonists. would definitely recommend it!4.5/5"
1642,5.0,"Thank you so much to Berkley Publishing Group for providing me with an ARC in exchange for an honest review!Oh my God. OH MY GOD! This Adult Romance was literally EVERYTHING I wanted in a rom-com and more. I think I died and came back to life 82475169 times while reading this. I laughed, I cried happy (and sad) tears, and I grinned like an idiot the entire time. It easily gets 1,000 stars out of 5 from me. If you love Adult Romance and any of the following tropes & character types, YOU HAVE TO READ THE LOVE HYPOTHESIS! • Fake Dating• Grumpy x Sunshine• Guy-Falls-First • Love-Interest-Goes-Feral-When-Something-Happens-To-The-MC• Mysterious/Broody Love Interest• Witty & Adorable Banter• Pining 😩• TENSION 👀🔥• Spice (like a 2.5/5 I would say)• Women In STEM/Academia• Demisexual RepIf you want to see some teaser quotes (one is NSFW) to convince yourself to read this, scroll to the bottom of this review! This book also deals with sexual harassment (explicit), death of a parent due to cancer (occurs in character’s past), and physical & emotional abuse (occurs in character’s past).The Love Hypothesis is most likely going to be my favorite rom-com of 2021. I can’t believe this is a debut book for Ali Hazelwood. Her writing style is so funny and her dialogue is so natural that I literally felt like I was watching this rom-com play out in front of my eyes (as Olive, Ahn, and Malcolm state multiple times throughout the book LOL.) If you’re a fan of books like The Spanish Love Deception, you’ll love The Love Hypothesis. Olive and Adam definitely gave me Lina and Aaron vibes, although they’re definitely unique in their own way. Also, they look exactly like Reylo on the cover, so….I also don’t think that I’ve related to a character more than I have Olive. Every single thought and inner monologue she had was so eerily similar to personal reflections that I’ve had myself. The discussions about her demisexuality and her trauma related to feeling like she’s been alone all her life were literally so emotionally accurate. I do wish that her conversation with Adam about her demisexuality was extended for a bit longer. When Olive explained that just because she had a hard time being intimate with someone she didn’t know that well, didn’t mean that she didn’t want Adam, Adam completely ignored the first half and only focused on the “wanting him” part. I think he should have definitely at least acknowledged the fact that she essentially admitted she was demisexual to him before moving forward in the scene. Additionally, Olive’s journey being a woman in academia was so deeply relatable that I couldn’t help but see myself in her. I literally started crying when she got her pancreatic cancer research approved because watching her constantly have to go the extra mile to prove herself as a worthy scientist and researcher all because she’s a woman made me want to scream at the book. Ali Hazelwood nailed the frustrations that women in academia feel everyday on the head, and I’m so excited to see her future works that feature more women in STEM!And then regarding the actual romance between Olive and Adam, I don’t think I’ve seen any other rom-com do fake dating as well as Ali Hazelwood in this book. It was pretty obvious who the guy who Olive ran into in the prologue was, but I was so eagerly waiting for their reunion. There is a slowburn in this book between Olive and Adam and it was sooooo well done. Their relationship while they were fake dating felt much more natural and sweet compared to other books with fake dating. I love how their relationship grew stronger as the book progressed. Even when they hadn’t admitted their feelings, there were so many adorable scenes that KILLED ME. Adam is the type of love interest who will go out of their way to make sure the MC is safe and comfortable and loved, and ASDFGHJKL I just love him and Olive so much 😭Anyways, as promised, here are some snippets and teasers that explain why I love Olive and Adam so much and why you should read The Love Hypothesis:Number 1:“People go out and do activities together. Like apple picking, or those Paint and Sip things.” Which are idiotic, Olive thought.“Which are idiotic,” Adam said, gesturing dismissively with those huge hands of his.HE LITERALLY FINISHES HER THOUGHT OUT LOUD! You can’t convince me they’re soulmates 😭Number 2:“But you could room with me.”“I couldn’t.”“The room is a double, of course,” he offered, as if that piece of information could have possibly changed her mind.“It’s not a good idea.”“Why?”“Adam.” She rubbed her forehead with her fingers. “There will be only one bed.”He frowned. “No, as I said it’s a double—”“It’s not. It won’t be. There will be only one bed, for sure.”He gave her a puzzled look. “I got the booking confirmation the other day. I can forward it to you if you want, it says that—”“It doesn’t matter what it says. It’s always one bed.”He stared at her, perplexed, and she sighed and leaned helplessly against the back of her chair. He’d clearly never seen a rom-com or read a romance novel in his life. “Nothing. Ignore me.”I absolutely love all the quips where Olive realizes she’s living in a rom-com IRL.Number 3: THIS ONE IS NSFW! 18+ readers onwards only!“What about the fact that I want this? Though maybe you don’t care.” She squared her shoulders, blinking quickly against the prickling sensation in her eyes. “Because you don’t want it, right? Maybe I’m just not attractive to you and you don’t want this—”It nearly made her lose her balance, the way he tugged at her wrist and pulled her hand to himself, pressing her palm flush to his gr**n to show her that . . . oh.Oh.Yeah.His jaw rolled as he held her gaze. “You have no f**king idea what I want.”GOOD BYE. I AM DECEASED.I don’t want to spoil all the other amazing moments that happen in this book, so I’m leaving it here for now. EVERYBODY GO READ THIS BOOK WHEN IT COMES OUT SEPTEMBER 14!"
1643,5.0,"Let it be known that Ali Hazelwood gives  ""fantastic, out of this world, laugh out loud, bed shaking, can't put this book down at 3am that you're afraid you're going to wake up your nursing infant""  swoon. Holy Crap!  The Love Hypothesis was EVERYTHING! I swear to God this is one of the BEST debut novels I have ever read, if not THE best. First I would be remiss if I didn't mention that if you are a Kylo Ren and Rey fan...you will die at the cover. This cover is SO unbelievable and yet so simple that you  WILL  in fact die. Because I'm dead. I'm physically not present in this world because Hazelwood killed me with the amazingness of her book. Anyone who knows me knowssss that romcoms are NOT my thing. Enemies to Lovers/Bullies on the other hand are. But The Love Hypothesis is the exception. The level of sarcasm in this book is so hysterical. I might have cackled like a maniac while reading (see the above mentioned fear of waking my infant child LOL.) This book was INSANELY good. It was heartfelt and honest and so real I wanted to just dive deep and immerse myself in Adam (hello Kylo Ren in real life) and Olive. Their budding friendship, banter, awkward dates and connection gave me life!! I am OBSESSED and never wanted this story to end. The women in Stem stories, the amazing friendships and cast of characters were just the cherries on top. Hazelwood has legit put me in the deepest of book hangovers that I just want to re-read my favorite parts all over again. This story was smart, sexy, compelling and a solid and strong debut from a brilliant writer. I loved everything about this story and can't wait to read more from this author in the future!Thank you Berkley Romance for this amazing read! Bravo! 5 Stars! ~Ratula ***I have no idea how to capture, in words, the breathtaking joyous glee that fills me up when I stumble upon book magic.And, if it’s not obvious (it will be), The Love Hypothesis is 100%, heart-thumping, swoon-inducing, smiles for days, 
book. Magic.
.Like, this is me – jumping up and down, squealing, and generally acting a fool over this book. This book which I was somewhat reluctant to read because I was unfamiliar with this author and unsure of the premise. This book that then proceeded to knock my socks off in literally the first couple pages. There I sat, already grinning like a maniac, already knowing that I was going to be obsessed with these characters and this magnificent story, and already half in love with this engaging writing, and captivating storytelling. And it was only page 6.Holy Moses you guys. This is the good stuff. The best stuff. The shout from the rooftops kind of stuff – like, READ THIS BOOK! It will make you so happy!  And it will also give you some anxiety. And maybe you will want to give Olive a good shake a couple times. But that squishy, gooey feeling in your stomach (and guuuhhhh, your heart!) will make everything worth it. Because for real, there are moments that will take your breath away. Moments that will make your heart knock about in your chest like it’s hopelessly, helplessly falling in love right along with Olive and Adam.Adam, who -- unghhhh. I don’t know how Ali Hazelwood did this. I don’t know how she wrote a hero who doesn’t say much, but says everything at the same time. I don’t know how she made him so dreamy, and nerdy, and grumpy, and sexy, and…like silently brooding and yet still soft and tender and so, so, achingly lovable. It’s witchcraft! The best sort of sorcery.And Olive – with her tender heart, and her quirks, and her smart humor and indomitable spirit. These two. You guys, I don’t even have words for how much I loved them. How literally obsessed with them I was. How greedily I devoured their story and how my heart lit up over and over again while they completely won it over with their adorableness, their sweetness, and their cluelessness. I am smitten with this story. I am sad that I can’t read it again for the first time. It was literally everything I love about romance, and my heart is overflowing with happiness and squee and so much love. I loved it. I can’t recommend it highly enough. So, once more for the people in the back: this is me shouting from the rooftops 
READ THIS BOOK!

1644,5.0,"THANK YOU Ali! Thank you for writing a book about a woman in STEM. I always feel like *we* are underrepresented in romance books. Thank you for showing a very realistic world of academia. This sentence really summaries my feelings at the uni:“STEM academia had been punctuated by self-doubt, anxiety, and a sense of inferiority. She’d barely slept the two weeks before her qualifying exams, often wondered if her fear of public speaking was going to prevent her from having a career, and she was constantly terrified of being the stupidest person in the room.”I loved the story of Olive! I couldn’t stop reading it and I would definitely have a long bookish hangover…I admired the concept. A handsome professor and a graduate student. The age gap was not too large, but I could really feel the difference in power. And their conversations and jokes made me smile the entire length of the book! Probably many of you would think that their hotel scene was slightly awkward, but this is why it was even more real. Questions and uncertainties. This is life. It was very refreshing. Usually I don’t like the conflicts based on a lie, but here I can forgive it!"
1645,5.0,i think this is one of the (if not the) best romance books i’ve ever ever EVER read
1646,4.0,"despite the rocky start, i ended up really enjoying this! once i got into it, it was a really fast read, the romance was cute and fun, and as a perfectionist overachiever, i really liked the academia setting. i wish i hadn’t known it was originally a star wars fanfic before reading bc i had to force myself to stop picturing adam driver, but it was ok bc i just imagined henry golding instead. "
1647,2.0,"✨Don’t do it. That! That thing you just thought! The ooo-I’ve-seen-this-book-everywhere-so-I-should-read-it thing.✨Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell and I really and I mean really did not enjoy this book. At some points I regretted I’d ever learned how to read. Unicorn knee socks staying on during sex 😤 made up many of those points.- What we were told about Olive: She’s got green in her eyes that dollar store mascara really brings out, she’s got no money but it’s fine bc it’s her ✨personality trait✨, she was literally blinded for multiple minutes by expired contacts (see previous personality trait) . . . sure?, and was a ❤️smart ass❤️. - What we were shown of Olive: Girl wouldn’t recognize a clue if it it stripped naked and did the YMCA with the Village People themselves in her face. For being supposedly super smart she was super super obtuse and oblivious and objectively the worst. It’s not cute and not fun to read about her misreading literally everything about every situation. However, she was great at being an ass to Adam though for deigning to care about the multiple facets of a being a professor of scientists. *There’s absolutely no way she didn’t recognize his voice. She didn’t have sight, thus making her other senses do more work, meaning she paid EXTRA attention to his voice which she’s super attracted too so like??? God so many things just didn’t make sense.*- What we were told about Adam: He’s big, he’s huge, he’s large, he’s a beast, he’s a mitochondrial powerhouse, he’s just such a large motherfucker, gargantuan really. He’s also such an asshole, a big asshole, a huge asshole, a large asshole, a beastly asshole, a mitochondrial asshole, just a large motherfucker of an asshole, gargantuan circumference really. - What we were shown of Adam: Sir was literally never not once an asshole. He could moon me right now and I can guarantee still no asshole. Aside from that, we were shown basically nothing about his character/personality besides that he’s a dirty mofo in bed which was completely at odds from the rest of his character. A sexual Jekyll and Hyde situation. Nothing we were shown of him prior to the sex scene translated to Adam during the sex scene. And then nothing after either felt like Sexual Adam either.*I also really am blown away that Hazelwood named this fucker Adam. I just think that’s really bad. Someone give Adam Driver a fat royalties check because his visage and name and body and voice were downright robbed. “. . . Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead . . . is entirely coincidental.” Ah yes. 👀**Furthermore, we never really got to know Adam at all. He was a very surface level and vague character which added to the whole power of him being a mysterious figure. It made their interactions awkward to me because this man was literally a faculty member and a stranger but he also has a rockin bod and we should want to make out with his face.*I didn’t like the power dynamic at play here. It felt skeevy knowing that he was a faculty member at her program. It felt skeevy knowing that at one point he was purchasing not just coffee but literal extra food for her to take home because she again had no money and depended on him to eat. It felt skeevy that professors were just going about shirtless at picnics. It felt skeevy that she sat on his knee like Santa Clause at an academic lecture. Their initial kiss felt skeevy. It felt skeevy knowing that it was even okay for them to date in the first place because it just does not feel at all correct.Just so many scenarios just didn’t make sense? A gallon of sunscreen? Expired contacts that blinded her? Kissing him and not realizing it was him? Him pushing a whole ass truck uphill? She’s told her friends literally nothing about him (we know nothing either) and they’re okay with that? This book was cookie cutter quirky and annoying and didn’t even have a solid enemies to lovers foundation to fall back on. What do we want? Enemies to lovers! And when do we want it? 352 pages ago! I don’t even know what to classify this book but I must have been mistaken when I heard it was EtoL. I suppose my classification would be: tiring. I also underestimated just how many science and academia terms I needed to already know coming into this book. I swear I truly did not know what people were talking about 40% of the time. I mean I went to grad school but the wrong one apparently. Take the end scene before the epilogue. She was talking about type I and type II errors and I had zero clue where that metaphor was supposed to take me besides the local bar to forget about it. I am not a science person but I really didn’t think it would be that much of a problem but it was. The relationship/romance didn’t hook me enough to where I wanted to slog through the dense topics and language. At least other books I’ve read with science elements try to explain the terms. Here they just hang you out to dry. I will say the sex scene was super hot and spanned many pages. Seriously scorched my eyeballs a little bit. But again, it didn’t fit with the characters so it still wasn’t enough to save this read for me. As a whole, the relationship was fine and I wasn’t too angry with them, I just got so bogged down by all the other nonsense and stuff that probably made sense to other people but not me. Overall, this book was what The Dating Plan was trying to be, which says more about just how bad The Dating Plan was, since while this is a better version of that book, this was still not a good book by any means for me. It was intensely cookie cutter and tropey and it never landed correctly. Pretty much all characters were one dimensional and had clear purposes for a story on paper, but not for an actual enjoyable, sensical plot. ⭐️⭐️.5/5 🌶🌶🌶.5/5P.S. I don’t even have the mental capacity to deal with what shit went down around page 230 but it was also very random and a lot on top of everything else and seemed to just be added in there for the story on paper but not the actual plot. I was aware it was going to happen and I was already dreading it. The takedown of him tho was great and dramatic and I’m happy Adam never wavered in his faith."
1648,3.0,"3.5 STARS.. read this because of the hype and i think i put too high expectation 😅 there were indeed some cute moments and i enjoyed some parts of the story but what a bit annoyed me and make me feel less enjoy the story is Olive the main character, she felt immature and did stupid decisions.. despite how hard this book tried to TELL the reader she is SUCH A SMARTASS (i mean she is in her doctoral study in one of the most prestigious Uni)You know, one of the petpeeves i had when i read a book is… when the book tried to sell me the protagonist is SMART and she basically did the opposite by the way she act or thinking 🥴 NOPE i don’t buy thisThere are some wellbeloved romance tropes in this book and diverse characters, which i think why alot of people really love this book and totally understand why it got so much hype"
1649,5.0,"OH. MY.

1650,4.0,"4 stars! Such a great book! It’s got touched of slow burn, grumpy/sunshine, unrequited love, hot nerdy-ness, flawed characters, best friends who support each other, academia, and so much more. Super easy to read, the writing was great. The author gave us some endearing characters, which I quickly loved them all. Just such a great contemporary romance! Highly recommend. "
1651,1.0,"Extremely unsatisfactory. The main characters are supposed scientists but seem to think that the solution to their problems is to fake date as opposed to having ADULT conversations with their friends. Goodness, if this was a representation of actual scientists, I would beg to exist this earth ASAP NKT"
1653,5.0,You guys weren't lying when you said this was good- I LOVED THIS
1654,3.0,"After reading:Exactly what I expected. Excessively hyped but not necessarily bad.______________________________________While reading:I might have judged this book too harshly.______________________________________Before reading:This book pops up in my feed atleast twice everytime I open gr. I want to know what's got everyone so excited but I don't find the plot enticing enough to actually read it. Such a dilemma 😫PS: For some reason when I first came across this book I assumed that it was so popular because it had problematic content, then I realizedit has 4 and 5 Star reviews. The human brain comes up with so many baseless conclusions."
1655,4.0,"4.5 ⭐️ “You just had to go and make me fall for you, she thought, blinking against his skin. You absolute ass.”LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS!! This book had me swooning, screaming, laughing, and smiling from front to back. I had high expectations going into this, but it really does deserve all the hype. Not a perfect 5 star for me but nearly there. I’m only docking off half a star because there were some parts where Olive was so oblivious like hello, HE’S SO IN LOVE WITH YOU, HOW DO YOU NOT SEE THAT?!! Regardless, she was such a relatable main character, love her. And wow the tropes in this were top tier. Adam Carlsen is the definition of “I hate everyone in the world but you.” This man was so grumpy but ugh he had such a soft spot for Olive, and my heart absolutely melted. And when I tell you… boy FALLS first, literally head over heels for her. Their inside jokes were everything. I loved the playful banter. This book has all the clichés, but I was living for it. The representation in this was AMAZING. The ending was perfect. Definitely a new favorite rom-com. <3"
1656,4.0,"***ARC provided by Net galley and Berkley Publishing (thank you!) CW: explicit scenes, and sexual harassment (18+)Going in, some aspects of the story were a little cringy, especially how the fake dating situation was set up, and whenever they had to act like a 'couple' in front of their friends. However, as the story progresses, their banter is so natural and cute it had my heart glowing like Jane the virgin. I absolutely loved Olive's journey through her master's degree, her anxiety in her academic career is very similar to my own which made this a self-insert FANTASY. I also loved how the author touched on workplace harassment and the power dynamics between professors and students. However, I felt that this story could have benefited from a dual POV. If you enjoyed The Kiss Quotient, love a rom-com, or are currently in academics, I think this story might be up your alley!Also it had a really good spicy scene…. like a really good one"
1657,1.0,"This book sounds hilariously stupid (34 year old “hotshot” biology professor with six pack ab, “very original” smart, quirky but insecure female character, obvious Adam Driver stand in). I’m actually a biologist that hates Reylo so… can’t wait to hate read this (after a couple of tequila shots).When will people stop publishing crappy fanfiction?EDIT: This book tried so hard on the “social commentary” and the “quirky fanfic tropes”. Anyway, I would give it negative stars if I could. Longer review to come."

The amount of pink tabs I have in this book LMAOOO (ps: pink tab is for cute scenes, not for yk what) You know you're down bad when you read that Adam's lips curved and highlight it immediately. Their inside jokes were so funny and cute HAHA. As well as their sarcasm, omg 😭I don't usually like the third person when reading, but this was THE exception. I was so hesitant to read this because most of my ""booktok hyped books"" fell into the case of ""𝐅𝐚𝐲𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐤𝐬 𝐢𝐟 𝐬𝐡𝐞 𝐝𝐢𝐝𝐧'𝐭 𝐠𝐨 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬, 𝐬𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐨𝐮𝐥𝐝 𝐥𝐨𝐯𝐞 𝐢𝐭 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞.""BUT I LOVED THIS SO MUCH.

1660,3.0,"I feel evil for this one. I think I’d ultimately give it 3.5 stars, if that was a thing, and often times I round up to 4. But this one just did not do it for me for the majority of the book. Don’t get me wrong, I’m into mutual pining and the leads not believing the other is also interested. But Olive was especially dense, and I did not find it cute or endearing. I found it repetitive and annoying. Around the 80% mark the book definitely picks up and I started to truly enjoy myself. But in order to really like this book, I just needed the conflict to show itself earlier. The conflict that wasn’t Olive convincing herself over and over again that Adam didn’t like her when it was blatantly obvious that he did. I was leaning into being benevolent and giving it 4 stars, but the last chapter was so heavy handed. It repeated the same jokes for the 20th time about Olive liking pumpkin spice and calling Adam old and literally regurgitating dialogue that I had to roll my eyes. I can see why people like this, but I have essentially read this book before and found that it was done better. "
1661,4.0,"I blame Twilight for this rating, that book made me a basic bitch and I resent it, but I loved The Love Hypothesis!!! 🙃🙃It was undeniable cute, nerdy as fuck, fun as hell (and not in the ""I'm trying so hard it gets awkward kind of way""), it was natural AND... I didn't see the steam coming *coughs* let me tell ya! It was hawt as fuck, I always thought of the word ""sweetheart"" as something endearing, now I can't!! The moment Adam said it I was 🤯🤯🤯🤯. *Rosie left the building* *panties on fire* *reasons why I'm single*Anyways, it wasn't perfect, the lying got old pretty fast and I wish Adam had more growth, but this is the first book from this author, so I have hopes people!!! 🤗🤗And yep, I have read a lot of MF lately where I loved the female character. You go MF, me proud!! PROVE THEM WE ARE MORE THAN WALKING SLUT HORMONES!!!Sweet little book. 🥰🥰"
1662,5.0,"Güncelleme 2: Geldi. Okundu. Adam'a sevdam perçinlendi.

Pretty fucking tragic twist of fate, but you don’t seem to remember that we first met years ago. An issue, since I remember a little too well. I like no one, absolutely no one, but I liked you from the start. I liked you when I didn’t know you, and now that I do know you it’s only gotten worse. Sometimes, often, always, I think about you before falling asleep. Then I dream of you, and when I wake up my head’s still there, stuck on something funny, beautiful, filthy, intelligent that’s all about you. It’s been going on for a while, longer than you think, longer than you can imagine, and I should have told you, but I have this impression, this certainty that you’re half a second from running away, that I should give you enough reasons to stay. Is there anything I can do for you? I’ll take you grocery shopping and fill your fridge when we’re back home. Buy you a new bike and a case of decent reagent and that sludge you drink. Kill the people who made you cry. Is there something you need? Name it. It’s yours. If I have it, it’s yours.

‘Ik hou van jou, Adam.’
Çok bekledim. Çok yükseldim. Akademi falan derken acaba terim terminolojide boğulur muyum diye küçük endişem vardı. Ama her şey çok güzel ve pozitifti. AL BÜTÜN PUANLARIM SENİN OLSUNOlive Smith, hayattaki tek varlığı annesini çocukken kaybedince yetimhanede büyümüş, okumuş bilime yönelmiş. Lisans, yüksek lisans derken endüstride çalışmak ile akademide kalmak arasında bir seçim yapma aşamasına geliyor. Parasızlıktan kırılmasına ve endüstride çalışarak parayı kırma seçeneğine rağmen hayalini kurduğu bir kanser çalışması için akademiyi tercih ediyor ve doktora yapmak niyetiyle Stanford’ın kapısını çalıyor.Dr. Adam ‘I’m Too Good for This Department’ Carlsen, Stanford’ın en başarılı ve en parlak bilim insanlarından biri ama oldukça aksi, lanet ve huysuz bir hoca. Danışmanlığını yaptığı, eğitim verdiği ve tez komitesinde bulunduğu öğrencileri ağlatan, asistanlarını inim inim inleten türden bir doçent. Tipoloji olarak da kopyala yapıştır Adam Driver. Kitabın temposu daha en baştan yakalıyor. Prolog kısmında doktora mülakatına gelen esas kızımızın üniversite lavabosunda esas oğlanımızla tanışmasını görüyoruz. İlk bölüm ise direkt iki yıl sonrasında Olive’in üniversite koridorunda karşısına çıkan ilk erkeği yani Dr. Adam Carlsen’i öpmesiyle başlıyor. Anlık durumu kurtarmak adına arkadaşına Adam ile çıktığını söyleyen Olive’in yalanları eline ayağına dolaşıyor, mecburen bir fake relationship temelleri atılıyor ve paldır küldür olaylara giriyoruz.Grumpy/Sunshine trope olarak her zaman ekmeğimi yer. Akademi teması her zaman ekmeğimi yer. Gerekli zaman aralığını vererek okursam fake relationship de ekmeğimi yer. Bu anahtar kelimelerle oluşturulmuş, harika, minnoş mu minnoş bir romans okumak isteyen varsa ŞİDDETLE ÖNERİYORUM. Pişman olmazsınız, olan olursa buyursun gelsin, alalım ifadesini.Herkese kurşun Olive’e papatya diyen Adam… Her aşamada, her harekette Olive’in rızasını sorgulayan Adam… Efendi erkek klasmanında gönlümün birincisi Joshua Templeman (The Hating Game)’ı sanırım yerinden ettin. Evet, birinci sensin artık"
1663,4.0,"i get it guys! i get the hype for adam now and it’s somewhat deserved. he’s too caring and attentive it’s make me soft. i really liked their friendship dynamic.. adored how they teases and messed with each other but the end… man i wanted something more, it just didn’t hit home for me. nevertheless, it was a good read. "
1664,5.0,"The Love HypothesisWhy is it always easier to write a review for a book you don’t really care for, but writing a review for a book that you absolutely love is somehow hard? When I think about what to write for this review my brain simply says “Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love. Love.” But that is not helpful, I know. So what do I love about it and why?The Hypothesis: April 2021. I am going to love this book. I am not sure why; I have never read a contemporary romance before. Maybe I need to give it a shot. The Experiment: Wait patiently for the book to come out. While waiting, start reading contemporary romance to get a basis for comparison. (Sample size of 10 books.) Find “The Love Hypothesis” early through BOTM Club. Once book is obtained, devour in hours. The Verdict: I LOVE this book because Ali Hazelwood is an absolute literary genius, not just a brilliant neuroscientist! It contains basically everything I love in a good book: smart characters that have a knack for being romantically inept, characters that are NOT teenagers, and all my favorite tropes! If I had to nitpick, which I know I don’t but can never help myself; my only hang up is the mention of rom-coms. Not every time, but several of the times that it’s mentioned, it felt reminiscent of when actors “break the 4th wall” by looking directly at the camera. The first time it happened, it brought me out of the story a little. HOWEVER, this being Ali’s debut novel, I put this back on the editors a little for not catching it in edits. Simply put, I loved “The Love Hypothesis” and it’s currently tied for the number one spot for favorite book of the year. Ali also make the top five list of authors I wish I could have coffee with. So, go read it already!!!! If you are reading this review before the publication date, September 14, 2021, you can use the below link to get the book for only $5 with BOTM. Do it, you won’t regret it!!https://www.bookofthemonth.com/all-bo... "
1665,5.0,"The book starts out with a dedication to women in STEM. 'Nuff said. I was hooked from the start!Side note vis-à-vis my qualifications: I earned my PhD in Cell Biology with a concentration in Immunology from the University of Pennsylvania in 2012. I delight in telling people ""I am not that kind of doctor."" It's one of my proudest accomplishments, and grad school was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I don't have to tell you how quickly I jumped to pick this book up; I almost pulled a muscle. What I hope to impart in this review is how accurately this book portrayed the devastating effects of imposter syndrome*. I picked up the book because I thought it would be a fun rom-com with science nerds but what I didn't expect was to feel so seen!*Imposter syndrome: also called perceived fraudulence, involves feelings of self-doubt and personal incompetence that persist despite your education, experience, and accomplishments. (from Healthline)This is maybe the longest I've gone trying to write a review for a book I only needed two days to read. I have been wracking my brain to find anything that I didn't like...
OK, RANT TIME...
Perhaps? Adam should have been upfront about liking Olive since he met her in the bathroom? Perhaps Olive should have been upfront about Adam's words being the boost she needed on hard days? Does that make him creepy?? Because from where I sit, it doesn't appear that she gives him anything but boners, meanwhile she sort of pins her whole confidence on his approval. DO NOT GET ME WRONG: IMPOSTER SYNDROME IS REAL! but I think it would have been more impactful if he was the one with self-consciousness issues. Although, we weren't in his head, and her inner musings were much more adorable. It was realistic, of course (that's what's sad about it), but that made it not as inspiring. At the end of the day, I believe she was great because she was actually a great scientist - I got the message - but the book threw so much doubt on her, to the point that without Adam's reassurances, would she have even made it as far as she did? I am NOT saying all women in science have to buck the fuck up and figure it out on their own or they're not valid, I'm saying THIS BOOK would have benefitted from making Olive a little bit more of a boss ass bitch. You know why? Because I have massive, debilitating imposter syndrome and based on the descriptions in this book, Olive worked a hell of a lot harder than I did in grad school and if I felt like I did a good job, then I'm clearly a piece of shit compared to her! What I'm saying is that I wanted her to know, to really believe by the end that she was awesome without having to hear it from anyone else.So that's that, apparently I didn't super-love Olive. Let me revise that, no, I loved Olive, I think I wish the female protagonist of this story was a bit different, but Olive for Olive's sake was adorable.Was the whole thing contrived AF? Absolutely! Who, tell me WHO would kiss a random guy to convince their best friend to go after that other guy? WHO would need some convoluted, weird, statistics-laden declaration at the end to clue the guy in to the gal's feelings???The only other thing I had a problem with was more substantial, writing-wise: if you're going to make your side characters major parts of the story, fine, do that, but do not make them take steam away from the MCs. The climax (ha! not that climax) of the story happens, and next, we're stuck with side characters stealing the thunder of the MCs reunion. I am sorry, I loved Olive's roommate and Adam's best friend, but right at that moment, their flamboyance completely overshadowed the moment Adam and Olive should have had after the ordeal they had been through.It's starting to sound like I had a lot wrong with this book, but trust me when I say, these were little irksome things (maybe except for that last part). What I loved about the book was done super super super well!
CONSENT, CONSENT, CONSENT!!!
Did I say consent? Let me also add consideration, as the power dynamic between a professor and a student can be massively unbalanced and Adam was hugely dedicated to making sure that never happened. Even if their relationship was always going to be fake, he made sure her professional development was not affected. And, given that he did really like her, it was doubly super sweet that he cared from the start to not interfere in any way in her professional development. Just the rumor of the two of them caused Olive some unexpected windfalls and that shouldn't be right, but it is the world we live in, so he could have had negative effects on her career - one way or another - but he made every effort to do it the right way.
PORTRAYAL OF GRADUATE STUDENT LIFE
I already said this is what made me feel seen. It was clear AH went through a lot of this. It was clearly written by a fellow scientist, and I loved the authenticity. I loved the jaded tone Olive had after having been in the weeds for two years. If you've ever loved something so much but been so heartbroken by how much it kicks your ass every chance it gets, then you will identify with this book, and you will understand imposter syndrome. Science is one of those professions that you have to truly love to stick with it, and in so doing, it will constantly break your heart, but that's the only way you know you really love it enough to stick with it. It also means you might love it and be there for all the right reasons and you might still fail, if funding dries up or if your results don't support your hypotheses, and that is terrifying for so many of us. I truly felt ALL of Olive's emotions.Harassment in science is also a very real problem. I would like to say the climactic situation in this book is extreme, and I cannot claim it happened to me, but it is not extreme, and it has happened to others. It's sickening how easily someone can be made to feel 1 inch tall in any circumstance, but if you go after a scientist and tell her her science is crap (that part has happened to me), she will feel the size of the microscopic bacteria on the bottom of your shoe. Having Adam be the polar opposite of his old buddy Tom was not only a great move for this book, but also a stark display of how stressful it can be for men to not be seen as harassing women. I always say ""uh, it's not hard, just don't harass people!"" Just don't be Tom, right? But from a male perspective, and as a male who is more senior than the female, I can see how hard this might be to navigate, which just made Adam's navigation of it all the more admirable (it actually should have been more stressful for him! Can you imagine how easy it would be for anyone, literally anyone, to assume he was just as bad as Tom?!).While Tom's harassment was super obvious, we don't talk enough about harassment of the Greg variety. Greg, a fellow grad student, accused Olive of not caring about anyone but herself because how could she be with a guy that all the other grad students were afraid of? and Greg felt comfortable being an incomprehensible DICK to Olive just because Greg was impotent to take out his rage on Adam himself. It's easy to hate Tom, but we get the satisfaction of seeing Tom pay for his actions. The things Greg said are inexcusable but he didn't do anything illegal, so he's not going to pay for what he said, even though it was textbook toxic work environment. Same with Adam's old advisor, TEXTBOOK! And Adam's reasons for not reporting his old advisor? Heartbreaking, and oh so real. This is also a really really real side of science, and a real side of dating in science, because not everything has a pretty solution, not all problems will be easily solved.I could write a thesis on imposter syndrome, soft skills, good/bad mentors, shitty fellow students, the portrayal of going into industry as evil, the lousy pay, the lack of free time. UGH, I felt so much in my professional brain reading this. But this is already a thesis, geez. Let's just say I really appreciate it, that alone made it worth the rating.

""Nuh-uh. This is a Hallmark movie. Or a poorly written young adult novel. That will not sell.""I mean, at least the author was FULLY aware of how contrived so many of the situations were. How can I be mad at that?! This is where the book's humor came from, and it was adorkably funny. Even the usual miscommunication parts were believable in a science setting, because scientists are so freaking shy and historically terrible at talking about their feelings and even here, imposter syndrome often extends to romance. Can I blame either of them for assuming the other wasn't in love with them?!It's just... when she realized The Guy from the bathroom and Adam were one in the same, it was a sweet moment and it would have been sweeter to share it with him. I am mad she kept that one to herself. And when she told him she wanted to break up their fake relationship, even though it was clearly making her very emotional and she very obviously was not feeling nothing, he should have been like 'what's really going on?' but he let her walk away. That was all a bit too much miscommunication for my tastes.
REP-PRE-SEN-TA-TION!!!
Female scientists, LGBTQ+, POC, and immigrants and not a single one of their identifiers was their only character trait. Anh was an activist, Malcolm was a fabulous friend, Olive and Adam were complex, only the mediocre white men were mediocre 😉AH did something else really delicate really well too: Olive's mentor was a female scientist, and I-don't-mean-to-sound-racist-but-it's-never-addressed-but-I'm-assuming-based-on-her-mentor's-name, not a white American, but she didn't make her an automatic good or bad guy. She was a kind mentor, but not a particularly helpful one. THIS WAS SO POWERFUL! as it paints the picture of different personalities that academia is comprised of. There are not just bad mentors and good mentors. Some are hard-asses that are super smart and no-nonsense and truly want you to succeed even if their advice makes you want to cry; some are super kind and, while smart, are not great at mentoring; some are good at teaching the science but shit at the rest of the development that goes into teaching you to be a successful scientist; still some others are phenomenal teachers of soft skills and professional lessons, but their science might be weak. HERE AGAIN! I can bring this back around to toxic work environments: I've known people to pick less stellar mentors because they've experienced toxic work conditions with the stellar mentors.*Side note here, Holden, of all people, for as little page time as he gets, seems to be the unicorn of the group and I would read a whole book about him in a heartbeat!*Olive also has this very realistic fear of public speaking that I know a billion scientists will relate to. It's a mentor's job to help you out with this, it's your mentor's job to help you be prepared for the next step in your career AS WELL AS teach you to do good science. Olive's mentor might have been super sweet, and we do not want to slam her, but she was not a great mentor. It was super ballsy and well written to make her so. Very nuanced with the characterization and representation.
THE TOTALLY UNEXPECTED SEXINESS!!
M'kay, I did not see that coming! Adam and Olive's chemistry was really great to read. I know I gave their characterization a hard time because their dynamic seems to be a little off, but their chemistry is great, and Olive truly feels supported by him, which is very important. When she wanted him at her talk, it was because she felt he was so supportive; when she realized all his various moods were all endearing to her, you knew she was in love with him as a person. They were super believable. Adam seemed very layered though, and I would have liked his perspective a bit more, as he was already super taciturn and not being able to know what he was thinking was doubly frustrating, but what I did get was a really sweet love story.Over and over, and in ways that she could never have anticipated, he had made her feel unjudged. Less along.This made my heart happy... And the sex was FIIIIIIRE!!
OVERALL
Characters were well written and fleshed out and the chemistry between the leads was great and the identification I felt was awesome. I never thought I would identify with it so much. I also didn't anticipate the steaminess! What a lovely surprise! For her small missteps, I would only take off half a star, because I loved so much of the rest of it.4.5 rounded up to 5, happily"

Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.

HOLY WOW! It Ends With Us is one of the most powerful books of 2016 and one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. It wasn’t anything like what I expected, but it delivered so much more than I ever hoped for. This is the kind of book that I want to give to every woman and just be like… READ THIS BOOK. NOW. Come to think of it, all the men should read it too. EVERYONE should read this book. Absolutely everyone. It's a story of unshakable love and finding the strength to make the right choice in the hardest situation. I honestly don't think I've ever been prouder of a heroine. I've loved Colleen Hoover's books for a long time because she always writes unique stories... and this one left a lasting mark on my heart. It is a MUST-READ!!This is a completely 
  spoiler-free review
. I'm not even going to add the blurb or tell you what this book is about. It's a Colleen Hoover book. That should be enough to tell you it's amazing. But I really feel that you should just dive into this book without knowing anything about the plot. To be honest, I'm the usually the kind of reader who likes to know every little thing about what to expect in advance, but I've really learned to trust Colleen's writing and her storytelling so even I went into this book without knowing anything at all... and I was blown away by the story!This book is unputdownable. You'll notice as you read that there are no good stopping points. None at all. I began reading it late at night and every time I tried to put it down to go to sleep, I just had to get back up and keep reading because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I didn't finish until almost 5AM but my gosh was it ever worth it!Of all the heroines I've ever read, Lily was most certainly one of the ones I admired the most. I knew loved her from the first few pages, but having finished the book, I truly couldn't be prouder of her. Her strength and conviction over the course of this story made her into a heroine I'd want every girl and woman to read about and look up to. She was so real and vulnerable as we all are, but the strength with which she took control of her life was admirable on such a deep level. I just wanted to hug her and cheer. I don't think I've been this proud of a fictional character before.There's an incredibly powerful message in this book that is very subtly woven in from the start. It begins in the first chapter, but you don't yet realize how significant each of these moments truly are... and as you read more, these pieces of the story come together forming a scenario that gives such a raw, honest portrayal of an incredibly relevant issue. I'm not mentioning it on purpose because I don't want you to expect it. The fact that it's unexpected for you as the reader is very important because it's also unexpected for the heroine. As she begins to realize what kind of situation she's in, so do you. And this realization very much allows you to experience her journey with her.The only thing I want to address head on is the question of the 'love triangle' because a few of you have read the blurb and have asked about it. All I want to say is to please try and move away from that thought. I don't want to spoil the plot at all, but that is so not what this book is about. That is not the point, or the focus. Whatever it is you're thinking this book is, just trust me -- it's so much bigger than that. Seriously, trust Colleen. I did.As a romance reader, I found this book incredibly refreshing. As much as I adore the romance genre (and I really do), it sometimes can get a little repetative. As both an avid reader and a blogger, I'm always looking for books that step outside the lines a little; ones that do something different or take the issues a little deeper. This book represented exactly what I wish I could be reading all the time -- not this literal story, but just the fact that it went in such a different direction and gave me such an unexpected story that left me with such a strong message.One of the things that intrigued me the most and had me wondering when I heard about this book was what the title really meant -- and there's this very specific moment when the title is echoed in the story that just had such a strong impact as I read it. That was my cheer moment. I just sat back and went 'woah!'. The title is truly perfect.In order to write this review, I went back over the book a second time and one thing I noticed strongly was how many intricate layers there were to the story that I couldn't possibly have known about in my first read. I loved that this is one of those books you experience differently (in a good way) both the first and second time though.I have to say that this book would make a seriously amazing movie. I could picture every scene so clearly as I read. This is also such an incredibly relevant story for many people -- whether they've personally been through what happened to Lily or they know of someone who has -- so I really do hope that one day this makes it to the big screen.My copy of this book is literally filled with highlighted quotes in every single chapter but I made a conscious decision not to add any to this review because I really truly do not want to give anything away about the story. Just trust me and jump into this story blind. I promise that it is a reading experience you don't want to miss.This began as one of my most highly anticipated books of 2016 and it is now of my top favorite books of the year. I was unable to put it down from the moment I started reading and I know that this is one of those profoundly beautiful and unforgettable stories that will stay with me for a long time. I highly recommend it to 
everyone

1681,1.0,"Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/“What a great time to have a dissenting opinion about a book written by an author with a particularly rabid fanbase!” said no one ever. In case we haven’t met and you’re seeing this review due to the new IN YO’ FACE! Goodreads format which shares reviews/updates to your feed errrrrrrrry single time one of your friends likes or comments on them, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Kelly . . . . 

Also, I spoil things, so back away quickly if you don’t want this one to be ruined for you.My glaring 1 Star in a sea of 5s probably makes it pretty clear that I detested this book, but please refrain from fetching your torches and pitchforks for a moment and take note that not only did I just 5 Star a CoHo Story two weeks ago (as well as shoved it down everyone’s throats I possibly could), but also I want to make all of the sexuals with Miles Archer and will fight anyone for dibs on his imaginary lurv making. I didn’t pick this up in order to hate on it. I’m one of you . . . . sometimes. Definitely not this time, but lots of times. And this is why I don’t ever give up on Hoover novels. I never know how I’m going to react.Allow me to explain what went wrong for me with this one . . . 

Let’s start with the obvious annoyances that seem to be in nearly every NA book that drive me batshit before getting to the real nitty gritty. First, the character names. Ryle, Lily Bloom and Atlas???????

Is it against the law to not use absolutely ridiculous (™Ron2.0) names in these books???? Second . . . . 
“Your lips. I love how they’re as red as your hair.”


According to Google (all hail Google) less than 2% of the world’s population has red hair, and yet 99.998% of all NA leading ladies do. Just stahp.Third, non-existent chemistry. In this story Lily and Ryle meet by chance on a rooftop after experiencing respective miserable days. In a matter of minutes Lily goes from worrying the stranger on the roof could be a psycho killer/rapist to getting into his super sexy (NOT) pick-up lines . . . 
“If you wouldn’t sleep with someone you just met . . .” His eyes meet mine again. “Exactly how far would you go?”
Ewww. She already said thanks but no thanks freakshow so STFU.Now let’s move on to the real big issue. I took a gander at my friends’ reviews before I started typing this and noticed my buddy Chelsea was the only other naysayer in the batch. She summed it up perfectly when she talked about the massive amounts of emotional manipulation that was forced down the readers’ throats in order to make them feel all the things.It’s a running joke with my friends/family/co-workers that I have a robot heart. And for the majority of the time it’s true. I generally experience two emotions – happiness and annoyance. But even a robot like me can be manipulated into having a feeling/crying the ugly tears like a Kardashian once in a blue moon (*cough Me Before You cough*). This time, though? It was like a flashing neon sign . . . . 

To begin with, our first leading male Atlas is a homeless teenager who Lily befriends/eventually loses her virginity. In case you don’t get the writing on the wall, Atlas is being set up as the most perfect perfection that ever perfected. He’s also the way to getting the “raised in an abusive household” plotline uncovered. Like in all NA stories, Atlas and Lily are torn apart. Lily moves on with her life, graduates college, yada yada, and, as mentioned above, meet-cutes super creeper Mr. Right 2.0 on the roof. Mr. Right 2.0 is not only another most perfect perfection that ever perfected, but he’s also rich and a neurosurgeon and very obviously husband material even though he’s never had a girlfriend (also after dating only six months), annnnnnnnd due to their mutually busy schedules not really knowing the guy.It wasn’t too hard to see where the story was going to go (and no, I hadn’t been spoiled because I didn’t read any reviews or the synopsis, I just auto-request everything by Hoover from both NetGalley and the library). Basically this was a story about domestic abuse and making excuses not only the first time he knocks your ass down “on accident” but also the second time when you wake up after “falling” down the stairs and hearing his sob story about a superbadawful that effed him up as a kid and then agreeing on a policy where 
“When you’re upset, just walk away. And I’ll walk away”
 (because THAT’S going to fucking work) and then saying 
“It’s okay, Ryle. It’s okay. You were angry, it’s okay”
 and making sure even when you’re bleeding profusely out of your fucking skull and are concussed and have quite possibly just been raped by your own damn husband that you get taken to an emergency room in a hospital other than the one where your bastard abuser works in order to protect his ass as well as explaining 
 “sometimes the reason women go back is simply because they’re in love”
 and in case all that wasn’t e-fucking-nough you add in a whoopsie baby (another NA per usual) to serve as the wake-up call that maybe it’d be a good idea to ditch this zero and eventually find you a hero, buuuuuuuuuuuut you just come to an agreement regarding visitation and whathaveyou rather than involving the court and much needed supervised interaction because you know he wouldn’t hurt the baby since it’s obvious he loves her . . . . 

Nope. I’m well aware I’m going against the grain here. I give zero fucks. Don’t bother trolling me to tell me how stupid I am (especially if you’re a teenager who has lived a privileged lifestyle and never experienced anything contained in this book for yourself). I went to the wholesale club yesterday and stocked up on big ol’ batch of . . . . 

I will be using it freely.Many thanks to the library for having nearly every book I ever want to read – especially books like these that are only approved to fangirling 5 Star reviewers prior to publication."
1682,5.0,"5 + brave and bold stars!!!

Want the naked truth about It Ends with Us? Reading this book will change your life. It’s so different from any of Colleen Hoover’s other books. You can tell it’s heavier, more personal, just more. This book is deep. It’s profound. It’s a book that needs to be read. I'll repeat: THIS IS A BOOK THAT NEEDS TO BE READ! This story is moving. It will make you think about things that are uncomfortable to think about. It will lift your heart, devastate you at times, make you proud, fill you with sorrow and make you smile. It will move you. It’s powerful and intense in the best way, but also has hopeful and lighter moments. The story itself is one that has been heavy on my heart from the moment I finished it. Sometimes, I read a book and it’s so beautiful, influential and emotional I will cry just thinking about the characters and their story. Not in a bad way necessarily, I just get that moved and that emotional while thinking about it. That is this book. Trying to find the words for this review is bringing me to tears. It’s hard to explain the story completely spoiler free, but this isn’t a ‘sad’ book. It’s a strength book. Because dealing with the issues in this story took so much strength. 

I’m not going to talk about the actual story at all, but I will speak a bit about the characters. Lily. Speaking of strength, Lily may be the strongest heroine that I’ve read about. Your strength is really tested when you are put in a hard situation where your choices are impossible. I loved Lily so much. I was proud of Lily and the choices she made. I want to be Lily when I grow up. 
Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.
There are two men in this story, but please don’t think this is a triangle book. It’s not. It’s hard to explain, but it’s not. Ryle is a charming guy. He’s a giving person. He’s got a lot of great attributes. I’m not sure if I’ve ever felt so conflicted over a character as I did him. Atlas is the type of man I always have a soft spot for as a reader. His story gutted me at times, but he is also a character with a lot of strength and so much beauty. I loved Atlas from the second I met him and that love never stopped throughout the book. 


“Lily?” he whispers, looking at me sincerely. “You just might be the best thing that’s ever happened to me.”
 Aside from the three main characters in the story, Lily’s mom played a prominent part. Their relationship played an even bigger part. Ryle’s sister and Lily’s best friend Alyssa was one of my favorite characters in this book. When things got hard she was there. One line she said in the book, to Lily just solidified the type of woman she was. Coleen always writes that one side character that you love so hard in her stories, and Alyssa was that character for me. I can’t not mention Ellen, because, well, it’s Ellen. That part was brilliant. It made me smile every time Ellen was mentioned. 

When reading this book, there were moments I struggled between not being able to tear my eyes away from the page, and others I had to take a breather because I couldn't handle what was going on.Parts of this story left me so heartbroken and others lifted me up so high. There are some parts that are just so powerful I could only read them in awe. This is it. This is why I read. Books like this. 

All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.

 Colleen Hoover is an author who truly has a way with words. She killed this book. I’ve read and loved all of CoHo’s books. Some of her earlier books are some of my all-time favorites. I’ve enjoyed all of her latest books, but this is by far the best book she’s ever written. And it’s tied with Hopeless as my own personal favorite book by her. And that is saying a lot, because Hopeless is one of my top books ever.   If you only read one book this year, let it be It Ends with Us. Everyone needs to read this book. 5+ star favorite. Completely unforgettable and highly recommended! 

“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”

1683,5.0,"Dear Colleen,I find it fitting that I write this review as a letter to you the way Lily would write to Ellen. Don't ask me why, I really don't know. What I do know is that I haven't been on Goodreads in nearly six months and it's entirely your fault that i'm here now. So, if i stumble upon a poor review on one of my books and end up in the fetal position on my kitchen floor surrounded by Ding Dong wrappers, well, I'm blaming it on you. I've even given my husband instructions to bill you for the psychiatry bill if that happens.On Friday I had a hysterectomy. It wasn't the worst day of my life, but it certainly wasn't the best. One chapter of my life--quite possibly the best chapter--ended. The surgery itself took twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. Can you believe that? Twenty minutes to take out the uterus that carried my three beautiful babies for a total of twenty eight months. Twenty minutes to change my life. Don't feel bad for me, that's not what I want. The offending organ had to come out, I knew this. But it didn't make it any easier. It didn't make the finality of the situation any easier. In all honesty, for a couple of minutes I didn't just feel like a chapter was ending, more like an entire flipping book. Maybe my life isn't made up of chapters, maybe it's part of a duet, or a trilogy? Either way, part of my story was over. Over a matter of several hours, I slowly woke up from surgery and at one point I remember sitting there and just staring at the wall paper in my hospital room. My uterus was gone. Mauve diamonds. The wallpaper was covered in mauve diamonds.That's the most hideous color, don't you think? Mauve. Not quite pink. Not quite maroon. I counted seven hundred and fifty three diamonds before I allowed the first tear to fall. But I wasn't just crying for losing a part of my body, and I wasn't crying for losing the ability to carry more children. I was crying because some women don't even get to experience what I've gotten to experience. Some women never get to have babies. They never get to feel them grow in their bellies. They never get to see the slimy little monsters as they tumble their way into this world.And I did.I got to do all of that three times.So why was I so upset? What the hell was my problem? I should be grateful, right? Happy?My husband slept soundly in the chair, snoring softly, but at some point my cries must have woken him up. He stirred and I did the only thing I could do ... I grabbed your book. You see, it was sitting on my bedside table. I buried my nose between the pages and when my better half asked me if I was okay I simply peeked over the top of the book and whispered, ""Colleen. She did it again.""I didn't need to say much more, he knows my obsession with your words and I found myself grateful. Grateful that he knew your books make me cry and grateful that you inadvertently allowed me to grieve. And that's what I did. I read your book and I grieved. I cried when Lily cried. I cried when Ryle cried. And even when no one was crying, I still cried simply because I needed to and I could and no one thought twice about it because i was reading and that's what i do when i read. It was my outlet, my excuse for the tears that wouldn't go away, the tears that kept falling despite my desperate protest.I cried for all of the Lily's in the world, and the Ryle's too. I cried for the Atlas'. And I cried for the Kirby's (that's my name. No i'm not named after a vacuum, or a cream puff)But you see, I didn't want to cry. I didn't want to be upset. I have three beautiful children whom I love with my entire heart. My body did it's job extremely well and that is something to be proud of. But why wasn't I proud? Naked truth?I'm selfish.I wanted one more baby even though my husband didn't. I wanted one more baby when there are women out there that can't have any at all.So why am I telling you this? My story is nothing like Lily's. Not even close. But maybe it is ... She wanted something she shouldn't want. I wanted something I couldn't have. She had a decision to make ... one that would change her life. So did I. She made a decision that was right for her and for her life at that particular time. Ditto.But the real reason I'm telling you this is because for two days I was drowning and It Ends With Us was my lifeline. It's what I grabbed when I needed to stop thinking ... it's what I grabbed when i needed to cry ... and when i finally finished the book and put it down, it wasn't mauve diamonds that I saw ... it was my smiling children.My three beautiful smiling children ... and my niece Lily. -- Kirby"
1684,5.0,"It Ends With Us... Wow I really don't know what to truly say about this novel. This review will be a little light because, like most CoHo books, you'll want to go into it with little to no information. I went into this book thinking it was going to be this one thing, and it turned out to be the complete opposite. IEWU follows Lily, a girl in her early twenties, who has never had it easy. Though coming from a family that was better off she has always had to work for the things she's wanted. After graduating college she gets up and moves to Boston and hopes to start her own business. While there she meets and falls for Ryle, a thriving neurosurgeon who is determined to be the best in his field. The two hit it off hard, and things seem almost too good to be true. Ryle is everything that Lily is not. He is forward, assertive, and stubborn. He is also a lot of thing Lily is; he is strong, passionate, and motivated. Though the two have an immediate connections and sparks fly, the two decided to take their time getting to know one another. Lily is such a beautifully written leading lady. I loved getting to grow with her and be apart of her journey. I loved hearing her thoughts and seeing how she processed things. When I was first reading and got to the point where she does her journal entries, but she does them so they are letters to Ellen DeGeneres, I thought I wasn't going to like that aspect of it. The first few had me thinking ""this is a little cheesy"", but the more I got into it the more I started to enjoy them. They really tied Lily's past and present perfectly together. As Lily's and Ryle's relationship pushes forward she finds herself looking back at those entries and thoughts of her first love Atlas resurface. Atlas was her first everything and was the biggest impact on her life. Atlas was the homeless boy who found his way into the abandoned house next door. Atlas and Lily as teens formed an unlikely friendship. Sharing everything and having a bond that no one around them seemed to understand. Spending every possible moment together and having so many stolen ones the two were kindred spirits. When Atlas reappears in the story it truly threatens everything Lily and Ryle have. (not a spoiler it's given he eventually will). Both Ryle and Atlas bring such important and different aspects to this story. I think CoHo manages to make them both such polar opposites, but at the same time manages to make them mesh so well.The characters in the book, main or side, all feel so realistic and authentic. When it comes to the plot there is almost nothing I can say about it. I hope everyone will do the same to keep things from getting spoiled. The story is an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. It's one of those books that you will have a thousand theories about and all of them will be wrong. I kept trying to guess what I thought might happen next and in classic Hoover style she managed to surprise me. This book was solid from page one and was steady throughout, but around the 80% mark is where things really took a turn (in the best way possible).  IEWU hit me on such a personal level. I didn't expect this book to impact me so hard. It had everything I wanted from a New Adult read. It's very classic CoHo, but it also branches out somewhere she's never been before, but she does it with such ease. She manages to weave these heavy moments with ones that will make you swoon, laugh, and then cry. My favorite part of this book though, was the author's note. Usually author's notes are at the beginning of the story, however it is so important that this one was left for the end. It took a book that was good and made it exceptional! God, this note effected me like so few books have. It made me cry fifty times harder than the entire book or anything Colleen's ever written.

Finding out how important this book was for her to write will hit you hard, but I hope she also knows how important it is as a reader to read. Knowing where an author gets their ideas from can change your whole outlook on a book, and this one... this one broke me.Thank you Colleen Hoover for continuing to gift the reading community with your words."

Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.
4 1/2 stars. Holy crap, what a book. This is unlike anything Hoover has written before. I have so many emotions right now that it's hard to know where to start, but I think everyone should read this book. That's right: everyone. I could easily give everything away. I could, but I won't. If you go looking for lots of reviews, it won't be hard to work out what It Ends with Us is about. And if you do, you should still read it, but I think it's better if you don't. I think you should go into this book knowing as little as possible. Just realize that this is something very different from Hoover's usual new adult romances (that I admittedly have had all kinds of problems with).So I don't want to say too much, but this is an extremely powerful story and it's not what most people will be expecting. It gets its power from the singular first person narrative (I'm honestly not a big fan of the alternating male/female POV romances) and we experience everything through Lily's eyes. When she falls in love, we fall in love; when her heart is broken, our heart is broken; when she gets it all wrong, so do we.I cannot stress how important and damn smart this book is. There is no black and white characterization - it's much deeper and more complex than that, and therefore, far more emotional. It peels back the layers of characters and relationships to do something that so many other authors have tried and failed to do - to make you understand a situation that for most people makes no sense. It's very sad, painful and exceptionally honest. My heart hurt while reading it and I almost cried several times.As well as all this emotion and sadness that I'm being coy about, Hoover also brings out some of her very best writing. Little gems of honesty about human nature and relationships that are all the more painful because of their resounding truth. It's such a quotable book, but unfortunately most of the quotes are spoilers, so I shall refrain from posting them.There's so many great things to mention, but I keep getting distracted by my feelings. The narrative is interspersed with letters that Lily wrote as a teenager and they are addressed to Ellen Degeneres - a strange touch that ends up being absolutely perfect. Shit, just writing this review and remembering the story is an emotional experience.And then there's the absolutely fantastic female friendship. I want Allysa to be my best friend. Hoover clearly knows her audience of 16-25 year old women, creating characters with their quirks and habits - Allysa, for example, is a self-confessed ""Pinterest whore"", which made me laugh. But seriously, she is the best friend ever and she says one of the most perfect lines in this book.Anyway, I'm just going to start rambling soon because I read this book in a whirlwind of emotions throughout a single day. I've been up since a ridiculous time and I need to go sleep now. But really, give this book a chance. I thought it was excellent.Trigger Warnings: (view spoiler)[Domestic abuse (physical, occasionally graphic). Attempted rape. (hide spoiler)] Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"
1686,5.0,"at the beginning i told myself i knew what i was in for and i was completely wrong. there are very few times, personally, when a book feels like it’s become a part of you. like you can physically feel it become a core book that you know you’d never stop thinking, talking, and recommending to those that would enjoy it. this is definitely that booki don’t think this book could have been written more perfectly. from the writing, the plot, to characters…nothing is fabricated. it is raw emotion and realistic. you fall in love with Lily. You want the best for her and you fight with her from cover to cover. i adored her character and reading her journey.i was so scared that this would end it a way that would have been unrealistic or just covered up in hearts and butterflies like we didn’t just witness 300+pages of trauma. but it didn’t, it quite literally ends with us. and you won’t know what that means until the very end. yes i cried. a lot. all for different reasons but i ended the book with the biggest smile on my face. it truly felt like i was on a journey with Lily, like i was vicariously living through her. this is definitely a favorite book of mine that i’ll be taking to the grave. i loved it so much and if anyone has anything negative to say about it you are simply wrong. i get the hype now and i was blown away. it went above and beyond from my expectations. if you plan to read this book, look up TWs because it’s very very intense. more intense than i realized. do not romanticize these characters because that’s just speaking over their trauma and experiences. and READ THE AUTHORS NOTE, it tells you how this came about. every page of this is worth it, if you can handle the subject matter of course. "
1687,5.0,"This book was really heavy. If you tear out most of the pages, it's not as heavy. But when you do that, the book just doesn't make any sense. "
1688,5.0,"Phenomenal! This book will make you fall in love, rip your heart out and force you to reconsider your preconceived ideas about abuse. This is the most moving book that I've read in a LONG time. It was absolutely addicting, but so difficult at times. I don't cry very often, but this one had me crying big, fat tears. It's been a couple of days since I finished 'It Ends With Us' and I'm still thinking about Lily's story. It's one that'll hang with you. In so many ways, her story gutted me. Yet, it was also inspiring.Lily grows up in an abusive household. After watching her mother suffer for years at the hand of her father, she tells herself that she'll never allow any man to treat her that way. She grows into a strong and independent woman, leaving behind the horrors of her childhood...Or so she thinks.Despite everything she's promised herself, Lily finds herself in an abusive relationship. The behavior and cycle is so insidious that you almost can't believe what is happening. Ms. Hoover manages to weave the violence into a relationship that is otherwise seemingly perfect. It is so skillfully written that you won't want to believe what you've read.  I found myself making excuses for the abuser. I didn't want to believe that he wouldn't change. For the first time, I could understand why women make excuses for abusers. I can only imagine how strong that pull must be in reality if I felt so strongly about a fictional character. I am in awe of Lily. Her strength and conviction blew me away. I don't think I would've been strong enough to do what she did. She was an amazing character.This was a beautiful and heartbreaking book. I recommend it to everyone. It is a must read."
1689,5.0,"I honestly don't know how I feel.There are times I am angry and times I am sad. And then I'm both. And it's the worst, because there is a war raging inside me, and the winner side keeps changing. How is it possible to switch from denial to sorrow to fury to acceptance in a heartbeat?

“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.” 

I did my best not to cry. I felt sick, but I clenched my jaw and forced myself to keep reading, trying in vain to ignore the tremors that ran through my body. But when the last chapters came, and Colleen's note in the end, I couldn't take it any more. I dissolved into angry, hot tears, and I checked my chest to make sure my heart was not bleeding. Lily's story had a lot to teach. I think I died a little when I realized that sometimes love is not enough. Regret, good will, they're not enough to fix some wounds. On the contrary, they make them deeper.

“Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”

It Ends with Us is the most personal and daring and painful book Colleen Hoover has ever written. Abuse and domestic violence are a delicate subject, and when I found out they were this book's main theme I thought about not reading it. It was a moment of cowardice, a moment I didn't want to witness this side of relationships. But I owed it to myself, as a person and as a woman to proceed. Because pretending a problem doesn't exist does not make it disappear. There will be spoilers below so if you haven't read It Ends with Us, you should probably stop here.

“Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen.” 

Naked truth coming. I was one of the people who don't understand. The people who, when they hear about abuse, the first thing that occurs to them is why doesn't she leave him? Why does she let her fear guide her, and she's so selfish that makes her children witness such horrors inside their home, that was supposed to be their sanctuary? But what we should ask is what is wrong with him? Instead of making excuses and trying to justify him, we should take a moment and consider how she feels, and the difficult decisions she has to make. Ryle broke my heart into millions of pieces. I fell in love with him, and I kept wishing that Colleen would delete these words, these scenes that hurt me and disappointed me and shattered my belief in happy endings. A part of me, a part I tried to smother, a part I am ashamed that exists, wanted him to change. To try harder, and for Lily to let him try harder. Me, who judged them for not leaving. In the end, I felt sorry for Ryle. For losing the love of his life, for destroying his only chance at happiness. I don't forgive him, I just wish that a magic wand would make everything better.

“So much gravity, pushing down on my emotions. Everything shatters.My tears, my heart, my laughter, my soul. Shattered like broken glass, raining down around me.” 

Lily is a hero. She had dignity, and courage and strength. At first I was judging her mother for staying, but witnessing through Lily's eyes her challenges, feeling her heartbreak and her dilemmas, made me regret all the ugly things I thought. Loving the person who hurts you is a greater torture than the physical act itself. And damn it I loved Ryle, and I hated Colleen for that. I hated her for making me swoon and laugh when she was about to shatter my soul. The Katerina that started It Ends with Us is a different person than the Katerina that finished it. Remorseful, destroyed, wiser.

“Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.” 

A part of me wants to forget this raw, powerful, inspirational, beautiful and ugly book. But the dominant part, even though it suffers, is glad I read it and learned.To every single person out there, READ IT.To every woman in Lily's place, BE BRAVE AND BOLD.To Colleen Hoover, THANK YOU. For sharing this with us. With me.

“Just keep swimming.”

1690,1.0,"2.5/5 ♡ this book sends a really important and worthwhile message, but it's not necessarily enjoyable.IT ENDS WITH US was not what i expected it to be. i started the novel knowing next to nothing about the storyline except that it's a colleen hoover book (NA romance) and that it's good (my friends kept raving). but if i'm being honest, i was a little disappointed. i was hoping for a light read with lots of ~FEELZ~ but instead i got something much more intense – not bad, just unexpected.the main plot revolves around abusive and toxic relationships within families. it really opened my eyes to the emotions of those in these types of situations and helped me gain a lot of perspective. because of this, i think it's important for everyone to read this, but i can't say if you'll like it.for the majority of this novel, i DIDN'T like it. i was definitely interested and curious, but i didn't care for the characters as much as i thought i would. i was frustrated and annoyed at the situations, and some of it felt artificial, rushed, and sterotypical. it all seemed so... fictional. usually the romance satisfies me, but even that didn't do it. buuuuuut it wasn't so much that i didn't NOT like it. it was simply okay when i expected it to be ~amazing~.(view spoiler)[there were two romantic tropes that bothered me because i don't like the tropes themselves and because i didn't think it was executed THAT well: insta-love and love triangle. ryle was too good to be true; a hot, young, smart, compassionate, arrogant, sensitive, rich guy suddenly appears and falls head over heels for our main character. they – somehow!! – meet again and this time he's literally BEGGING to have sex with her. suddenly, this fuckboi wants to be in a committed relationship and plans on having kids with our lucky lady. um......... okay????? i didn't feel anything for their relationship and ryle seemed like a plot device to me. and when she didn't leave him the first time, i knew i KNEW he would do much worse again. and i didn't feel surprised when it happened; i didn't feel surprised when she asked for the divorce – a little relieved maybe, but not surprised.then there's atlas, who i felt had more depth than ryle and lily but also not thaaaat much. he was probably my favorite character, but i felt his story (the letters) were kinda.. anti-climactic? their relationship was confusing to decipher, but i still loved them. it made me sad to think lily didn't end up with atlas IN THE FIRST PLACE but i guess that would make the whole purpose of the book redundant. (hide spoiler)]even though i didn't enjoy the process of reading this book, i'm grateful to have read it. there are some books you read for pleasure and there are some you read to gain knowledge and perspective. this is the latter."
1691,5.0,"If you need me I'll be sweeping up all the pieces of my shattered heart. Dear God! It's amazing how you can read a story that is simultaneously gut wrenching and beautiful. I'll be honest, I managed to make it through this ENTIRE book without shedding a single tear... until I hit CoHo's note/acknowledgements at the end and ugly cried. The fact that this story had so much basis on real life events that meant so much to her shined through in her writing. Clearly you can guess the ending of the story (to some degree) by the title, but a majority of what makes this story so breathtaking is the journey there. ""It Ends With Us"" caused me to look at domestic abuse in ways I never allowed myself to in the past. As a society we are quick to judge women (and men) who stay in abusive relationships without taking into account what the process really is like for them. We get a slight glimpse into the fragile situation of how incredibly difficult it is to leave a dangerous relationship when you love the person who is causing you harm. I won't say more for fear of ruining the reading experience for someone else, but this book was so much more than a flimsy romance novel. Highly recommended! (Maybe I'll stop ugly crying by the time you've finished reading it.)"

""We all have a limit. What we're willing to put up with before we break.""
When was the last time a book just completely slayed me, cutting me so deep and evoking such strong emotions? It feels like my heart has been filled, then broken, filled, then broken. In the end, I'm stunned by what I read.It Ends with Us starts out innocently enough. We follow the courtship of Lily and Ryle. He is handsome, successful, and so thoroughly smitten by Lily he can barely think. He makes advances while claiming he doesn't do relationships. She rebuffs him while secretly pining for him. Really, it's all fun and a bit frivolous, your standard romance.But then we arrive at the core of this story, which I won't spoil because it's best to read it from Colleen Hoover's own words. I'll just say that the main topic in here is something that a lot of books try to tackle, but very few do right. Hoover's portrayal is brutal and compelling, and it's hard to look away. Her nuanced approach makes the whole thing ring true, and she brings a humanity to it that is both sobering and heartbreaking.I read this book years ago when it first came out, and I remember thinking highly of it, though not much else. So when I read it again this time, I admit I was shaken by how hard it hit me. I think it's because I'm older now and have more experience with love and relationships, so I'm able to appreciate this story even more.My suggestions if you're going to read this book: have a box of tissues ready and don't skip the author's note at the end. I sobbed my way to the finishing line, then read the author's note and sobbed some more. This is a riveting and worthwhile read, though at times difficult, and it showcases Colleen Hoover at her best, taking her contemporary new adult genre and elevating it to soaring heights."
1693,5.0,"reread, just to see if my previous statement holds up.and in case you were wondering - yes, this is still my favourite CoHo book. ____________________________this is, without a doubt, my favourite book by colleen hoover. im still trying to process everything i read, but goodness me. this book, this book, this book. where do i even begin with something as beautiful, and real, and devastating as this? just thinking about this story immediately gets my pulse racing and my stomach in jitters. this book covered so many brutally heavy topics that it left me shattered in the best way possible. it was a heartbreaking and heartwarming story, all at the same time. it made me question and think about some standards i have for myself, because you never really know how you are going to react in a situation until you are faced with it yourself. and because of that, you should never judge another persons circumstances. i think this story effectively shows that theres not always a right or wrong answer. not everything is black and white. and sometimes, when it comes to love, you just have to listen to your heart and thats the best you can do. my only critique was i desperately wanted more of atlas and his story. he was such an interesting character and i didnt feel like i got enough of him to be satisfied with his storyline. but overall, this story has stolen my heart. i also know this story was particularly personal to CoHo, so i just wanted to say how honoured i was to have read something she felt strongly enough about to share with her readers. i think it made the book so much more meaningful than it already was.↠ 5 stars"
1694,5.0,"You guys are always telling me this author writes vaguely shitty romance novels and is unbelievably overhyped... and yet this masterpiece exists? I call bullshit because this was masterful.If you have read this book and also follow my reviews, you know the topic of abuse is one I sort of talk about a lot. this book got it right. this book got it so, so right. 
So let’s talk about why.

→ character work ←
I knew I would love Lily from the moment she stood up at her abusive father’s funeral and refused to speak. And oh boy, was I right. Lily works so well as a protagonist because she isn’t the archetype. She has been through abuse herself and she is so, so sure it would never happen to her. She would leave if even one thing happened. She would. ...But then she doesn’t. She reads as absolutely, totally real. And her character development? Fucking iconic. 
→ friendship focus ←
Something that really bothers me a lot in romances like this is that a romance tends to save the protagonist, and I think this book - despite marketing that made me concerned this trope would rear its ugly head - 
does the opposite.
 The lead friendship here between Lily and Alys is so 20/10 and so important. And even though there is a touch of romance, I think the book is very explicit about it not being healthy for Lily to jump right into a new relationship. I appreciate that a lot. 
→ narrative treatment ←
I think this is one of the only books I have ever read that actually seems to understand that 
abuse is a mortal sin.
 The wild thing is, aside from his moments of extreme rage, Rylin never appears to be that bad of a guy. He apologizes every time. He continuously seems to account for Lily’s feelings. But his actions against her are enough. There is no question in the narrative on whether she was being unempathetic: Lily was right to leave, no matter how he treated her in the aftermath. And I think that means a lot to me, how his character is nuanced but also irredeemable for Lily. I mean, aside from these three things, everything about this novel was basically good - the writing is extremely clean and easy-to-read, there are some really really funny moments, the romance that does end up occurring is genuinely sweet, and it's overall a win - but on a personal level? I am destroyed. This book is not just good, this book is Fantastic. and that's my opinion. goodnight. Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube"

This book is a masterpiece…

“Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.” 
I won’t summarize this book to you because this is a Colleen Hoover book. She doesn’t need an introduction. She is Colleen Hoover. Her name is enough reason for me to read her books… <3But you should know just one thing about this book… “THIS BOOK WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE…“This book will make you realize whatever bad things you live in your own life that we shouldn’t give up from ourselves … We just have to keep swimming until we reach the shore… This book given me a lot of things to think about… And I never found myself a situation like Lily did. But when I start to read this book I felt that like I was the main character in this book. Colleen made me feel Lily’s all good and bad moments. One time I found myself laughing out loud and another time I found myself crying with her… And I must warn you, you’ll cry like a river… I even cried when I read Colleen’s note end of the book. I finished the book almost 36 hours ago and I’m still trying to gather myself. I'm really stuck right now with my own thoughts. I wanna tell you more about this book but words will only fail me because it’s really so hard to write a review about this book. It’s so damn hard. But nothing I said won’t be enough to explain how powerful is this book… Nothing will never ever enough to express my love about this story... So please stop losing time and read this amazing book. Trust me you won’t be regret for reading it. ;)Colleen Hoover, thank you very much for this unforgettable story. THANK YOU! <3Ps. If I have a bad day I’ll think about this book. And if life gets me down, I’ll just keep swimming until I reach the shore… <3

1696,5.0,"4.5 estrellas.Wow. Solo puedo decir... wow.No esperaba que Colleen me fuera a sorprender así. Si ven mis videos saben que cada libro que ha ido sacando me ha gustado menos y menos, ¿pero este? Es de lo mejor que ha escrito. Estoy sorprendida de una muy buena manera.Escribiré mis pensamientos completos pronto."
1697,4.0,"SPOILER FREE REVIEWAs a member of the human species with a Y chromosome, I admit that the allure of the romance novel eludes me, even though I'm a particularly hopeless romantic myself. The thought of reading about a prolonged courtship isn't something to get all excited about. After all, how many people out there are actually interested in hearing about my own misadventures in the dating arena?On second thought, don't answer that.So when I started diving into It Ends with Us: A Novel by Colleen Hoover, I expected pages of the same old trite that have filled thousands of romance novels ever since the first caveman dragged the first cavechick by the hair back into his stone-age pad. Wouldn't you know it? I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Let's take a brief rundown of the requisite elements and see if this novel has them:  	 Girl Meets Boy - CHECK  	 Boy is Impossibly Handsome - CHECK  	 Boy is Impossibly Rich - CHECK  	 Boy is Impossibly Talented - CHECK  	 Boy has Mysterious Name - CHECK  	 Boy is Emotionally Aloof - CHECK  	 Girl Tries To Deny Feelings For Boy She Just Met - CHECK  	 Boy Makes A Move - CHECK  	 Girl Pretends Not To Like It - CHECK  	 Boy Says Something Clever and Sexy - CHECK  	 Boy and Girl Have Wild, Raunchy Sex - CHECK  Okay, the last one actually doesn't happen for a good while owing to the tried-and-tested phone-call-interruption-just-when-we're-about-to-do-it cliche, but it's still there.Here's a description of when the two lovebirds first meet:I feel his voice in my stomach. That's not good. Voices should stop at the ears, but sometimes - not very often at all, actually - a voice will penetrate past my ears and reverberate straight down through my body. He has one of those voices. Deep, confident, and a little bit like butter.

Here's another one:This guy is beautiful. Well-manicured, smells like money, looks to be several years older than me. His eyes crinkle in the corners as they follow me, and his lips seem to frown, even when they aren't.Now, why would I give four stars to a book that overuses so many tropes?Because Colleen Hoover knows her audience so well it's almost criminal. Her writing is clean and lucid. The protagonist is fleshed-out. The story tugs at the heart. Everything else can be forgiven.And by the end of the first half of the book, it becomes painfully obvious that this novel is not about romance. It's about heartache.Our protagonist is a 23-year old wannabe florist named Lily Blossom Bloom (yes) who meets brooding neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (again, yes). Lily's father has recently passed, and she's trying to come to terms with her less-than-stellar relationship with dear ol' dad. Flashbacks are interspersed throughout the book via Lily's high school diary, and we quickly find out that her first love was a homeless guy named Atlas Corrigan (for the last time, yes) who lived in an abandoned shack near her childhood home. To say that dad and Atlas did not get along is an understatement.Lily is a smart and driven woman, and it shows through her personality. She balances the pleasures of love with the pleasures of work. A couple chapters in, she decides to pursue her dream and open a flower shop:""Sweet, life, pink, spring."" I repeat. And then, ""Allysa, you're brilliant!"" I stand up and begin pacing the floor. ""We'll take everything everyone loves about flowers, and we'll do the complete opposite!""Nice one, Lily.But of course, this wouldn't be a good novel if all we ever read about is how good Lily is getting it at the office and in the bedroom. Midway through, disaster strikes.I won't say what kind of disaster, but there's quite a few of it, both in present time and in the flashbacks. And then there's love. And then there's disaster. And then there's love. And then there's disaster. And then there's love.This book may overuse so many things we've come to expect of romantic comedies, but when I figured out the real message Colleen wanted to impart, I swept all the small things under the rug. This novel is a heartfelt plea for the readers to empathize with men and women who are caught up in relationships that are causing them turmoil and pain. It's a call to have an open mind when confronted with a similar relationship in the real world, both for the man, the woman, and their families. Finally, it leaves us with a beautiful if not sad moral lesson that the right thing to do may sometimes also be the hardest thing to do.People say that teenagers don't know how to love like an adult. Part of me believes that, but I'm not an adult so I have nothing to compare it to. But I do believe it's probably different. I'm sure there's more substance in the love between two adults than there is between two teenagers. There's probably more maturity, more respect, more responsibility. But no matter how different the substance of a love might be at different ages in a person's life, I know that love still has to weigh the same. You feel that weight on your shoulders and in your stomach and on your heart no matter how old you are.The book is peppered with phrases like the one above, and the more I read, the more I got the feeling that the words were coming from the author's mouth and not the protagonist's.At the beginning and end of the novel, there is a personal message left by the author, and the motivation for this book suddenly becomes clear. They say writing is a private and cathartic process, and for Colleen, this certainly was extremely private and cathartic. It must have taken a lot of effort to write. It's only fair that it took a lot of joy to read."
1698,3.0,"“As hard as this choice is, we break the pattern before the pattern breaks us.”This is my first Colleen Hoover novel. So far I've stayed away from her books for several reasons. You might even call it prejudice, but my judgement didn't fail me. Here's why:First of all Colleen's ratings are mile high and I'm usually a little doubtful when it comes to that. I just have this feeling that this novel/author is very likely overrated.Second of all the plot synopsis of every single one of her books seems - how do I say that without sounding mean? - boring. Uncreative. It's always the same in a way. Like Nicholas Sparks (who by the way is a huge homophobe which is the one big reason I'll never ever read one of his books or watch his movies) you know exactly what to expect. A pretty, white and probably starcrossed couple falling in love. Lots of melodrama. A few big shock moments here and there. You know what I'm talking about.The third reason: It's just so straight. And I love a fair share of gay. And I really don't care for straight sex scenes.About this book:Ah well sometimes even I am a slut for clichés and Colleen hits them all. She's a pro. So yes I rolled my eyes a during the first few pages when a tall, dark, hot stranger meets the main character on a rooftop in the middle of the night and they immediately share their deepest thoughts with each other. But secretly I also enjoyed it. I enjoyed their perfect lives and their luxury and the fact that a 24-year-old girl opened a successful and even revolutionary flower shop. I mean, sure why not.The characters seemed fine but the only one I really cared about was Atlas. He really seemed to have character depth while the others just fell a little flat. But then again this is not the kind of novel where I expect the characters to be complex.The names are just horrible. Gosh honestly, this is so typically American, such a white people thing. ""Let's just add an 'e' to my brother Rile's name and that's exactly what I'll call my daughter. Rilee."" ""I love Ellen Degeneres and Finding Nemo so my daughter's middle name will be Dory. And by the way, my name is Lily Blossom Bloom, nice to meet you."" Do I have to say more? Yup, my head hurts from rolling my eyes this much.Now this book tackles one big topic and it's called domestic violence and abusive relationships. And in my opinion, Colleen did a good job of portraying them. Of course, I have no experience with this particular matter so I can only judge it from the outside. But as the author explained in her afterword every (abusive) relationship is different and plays out differently. She herself wrote about a young woman's struggle to free herself from this violence. It wasn't an easy fight and she will probably have to fight it in the future. Of course, I wished for her to end it right when it started, but this often isn't the reality. Then again it's a book, which has the power to set an example for other men and women and it shouldn't even have gone this far. But then again it wouldn't have pictured the struggle a person faces when he or she experiences such violence. You see, this discussion could go on and on.In a nutshell: I didn't connect with any of the characters or got emotionally involved in any other way, but it's an entertaining book with a surprisingly deep turn.Find more of my books on Instagram"
1699,2.0,"*Hey. Hi. Someone recently jumped on this SUPER old review to make a snarky comment (people tend to hop on here from time to time). This is from 2016, howsabout we let it die?? Feel free to put your comments, your opinions-all comments are welcome-whatever. But if I so much as feel you're harassing me, attacking me, or being a total douche about my PERSONAL feelings on a PERSONAL review-MY OPIONION, MY RIGHT-then you will be blocked or ignored. Not every author is for every person. I figured that was clear....so I guess I will make it clearer: I haven't read another book by this author since this review was written. I do not harass authors and I do not read books by authors I do not connect with. That's the responsible thing to do. Now it's your turn to respect what I wanted to say, and STILL stand by after all these years, and move on along or comment nicely. Thank ya thank ya******I. Am. DONE.

I do NOT like books that manipulate me. I do NOT like authors who think it teaches life lessons by making everything literally the WORST scenario possible. I do NOT like books that I endorse, tell 100 people to read (when I'm at 47%) because it was so amazing-wonderful-addicting-beautiful, and then have to eat crow because a million dreadful things have to happen to get to the fucking point. And for those who ADORED this book, do NOT come at me and tell me I am wrong, didn't understand the message, whatever. I do NOT like being manipulated (SEE ABOVE) when I was already okay with how things would eventually turn out. I didn't need five more fucking stabs in the stomach to get the fucking message. For those who keep talking about all their feelings and how they are having trouble writing a review because of all their feeeeeelings...that's manipulation you're feeling, people. And I am so mad I don't care who I'm offending. I loved the idea behind this book. I did. And even though I felt so much love in one way, I was okay with the devastation everyone spoke of. But then-All. That. 

SHIT. I will never forgive Hoover for this. Ever. I think I am FINALLY done this time. I am ALWAYS the black sheep on her books...and I have no fucking clue why I keep coming back for more. Probably because I loved Miles (THE ONLY BOOK I'VE EVER LOVED BY HER, making me the opposite of everyone, yet again) so much and want another win...but there's only so much bullshit I can ingest per author and she might have just met her quota. 

And it's this author's twisted sense of life lessons we need to learn. Oh, and PS, I LOVED BOTH GUYS SO MUCH IT HURTS-so don't even try that one on me. Sorry, guys. I slept on it, and I was even madder today. And I assume my attitude concerning this novel will only get worse, so it's best I post today and let it be.

1700,4.0,"”Oh, I want you, Lily. Make no mistake about that. I just don’t want to want you.” I thought really long and hard about how I’m going to review this book and what it always comes down to, is that I actually don’t want to review it. This is one of the rare books you just have to read yourself. You have to experience it and feel it and no matter what I’d write in my review, it would never even get close to all the emotions that hit me while I read “It Ends With Us”. This book makes you happy and sad, it confuses you, breaks you, hurts you, makes you question yourself and your thoughts! Hell, it makes you question your own code of ethics. ”The reasoning is the hardest part of this. It eats at me, little by little, wearing down the strength my hatred lends to me.”It would be easy to judge; easy to sit on a high horse, but the way this is written, the way Colleen Hoover conveyed her feelings… It makes it impossible to go out of this book without acknowledging her POV, it makes it impossible not to think about it. I know the world is not white and black. I always knew that there are many shades of grey, but this book? It confronts you with the deepest grey and forces you to deal with it. It poses the simple question: What would I have done? And as usually, the simple questions of life are the hardest and most complicated to answer. ;-)”All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.”We all know what we SHOULD do in certain situations! What is expected of us, but when you’re actually in one of those situations? When feelings are involved? It’s not that easy anymore…I could be vague and probably continue like that forever but I won’t say more than this! It wouldn’t be fair to all the people who still want to read “It Ends With Us”. So all I’m saying is this:- This book is important! - I really liked Lily as a character and I admire her! (view spoiler)[She did the right thing in a very difficult situation and she was so, so, so brave to end her relationship with Ryle!!! It had to be done, for the sake of her child, she had not only to let go of him but also of her hatred for him. And to reach that point, to make that decision, to give her child the opportunity to have a father and to forgive him for what he did? THAT WOMAN IS STRONG!!! <333 She has all my love and being a mother myself who only wants the best for her child, I could understand her decision!  (hide spoiler)]- Atlas is a precious bean and I love that man! <3 (view spoiler)[
  ”I close my eyes as I soak up the familiarity of him. His smell, his touch, his comfort. I’ve never understood how someone can be so rock solid, yet comforting. But that’s always how I viewed him. Like he could withstand anything, but somehow still feels the weight that everyone else carries.”
(hide spoiler)]- I enjoyed the two different POVs from Lily. Her teenage diary entries and the current plot made this a really intriguing read. Sometimes it felt like there were two different Lily’s which dominated the story line and I guess in some way there were, because the years of experience made them two different people. - Alyssa was the best friend ever!!! <333 (view spoiler)[When she told Lily that as her brother’s sister she didn’t want her to leave him but that as her best friend she had to tell her that she HAD to leave him, I actually had tears in my eyes! I loved her for saying this! Because she knew that Lily couldn’t be with Ryle and she loved her enough to help her to make the right decision. And this even though Ryle was her brother!! It takes strength not to let those family bonds get in the way and Issa was a very strong character for sure.  (hide spoiler)]- The ending…. I’ll never get over it. (view spoiler)[I really liked Ryle at the beginning of the book but the first time he hit her, I already wanted her to leave him. To hit your wife is inexcusable, to hit her twice or three times? Unforgivable!  ”You are my wife. I’m supposed to be the one who protects you from the monsters. I’m not supposed to be one.”I really wish I would have found out why Ryle was the way he was, I mean I get that the death of his brother did something with him, but why could he be so nice and caring to his sister and his own child, but felt an urge to hit his wife? Just because he was angry and saw red? For me as an outsider this is kind of tough to understand. A Ryle POV might have helped to understand him better. I mean it was obvious he regretted what he did, that he knew it was wrong, that he wished he would have never done it and that he hated himself for it. But WHY????!!!! WHY, Ryle??!! I guess that’s the main reason why I’m still thinking about this book. I’m having a difficult time to understand his actions, but maybe I’m just overthinking it and he really had no control over what he did… I guess I’ll never know. (hide spoiler)]- Read it, but be warned! It’s not an easy read. Trigger warnings: (view spoiler)[domestic abuse, violence against women, abusive relationships, homelessness (hide spoiler)]Conclusion:This was an emotional and haunting read and totally not what I expected. It definitely kept me on my toes though. XD Colleen Hoover is a great author and I’ll continue to read her other books. In future I just might be a little bit more careful when I start one of them. ;-)___________________________________It was time to consult my ""Bookie Jar"" and to find out what I should read next.Apparently it wants me to read my first Colleen Hoover book ever and I’m so ready for it.I’ve seen her books all over my feed and I’m very curious if I’ll like “It Ends With Us”.I didn’t read many romances lately and I’m really no expert when it comes to this particular kind of genre, so I’m definitely open for it. So far the only romance authors I can recommend are Joyo Moyes, Cecilia Ahern and Nicolas Sparks. *lol*Let’s find out if I’ll be able to recommend Colleen Hoover in future too. ;-P"
1701,5.0,"5/5 incredible stars.Colleen Hoover strikes again.This book has completely misled me, I admit.This is actually the third book I read from this writer. I don't remember much of the first book (Ugly Love), but I'm aware that I loved it. I think I'll read it again soon, to refresh things.Then, I read the book ""Confession."" That's where I fell in love. And strongly. I don't know if you read my review of this book, but if so, I guess you can notice how much this book has affected me.Anyway, the name ""Colleen Hoover"" was engraved in my head, and I came to the decision that I wanted to read more of her books. I admit I didn't really know which book to pick up, so I did it randomly. I have to admit, the impression I got about this book from the description is not wow. But if that's what I got, then whatever.Now I thank my random choice, and big time.Like I said, this book fooled me.I was sure at the beginning that it was such a nice love book. Oh, how wrong I was.Continuing, I realized how amazing Colleen Hoover is, how fascinating this book is, and how important the message and meaning is.This isn’t a book that tells only about love, it is a book about the lives of quite a few women in the world who have experienced it.The plot talks about Lily, a sweet girl who tried hard to rearrange her life.At the beginning of the book, she meets Ryle, a smart, handsome, assertive neurosurgeon. And he really likes Lily.They manage to connect and get to know each other with their secrets. They call it ""naked truth."" The extraordinary truths and familiarity brought them to life together. But how can you forget the sweet guy from Lily's past?Atlas is an absolutely exceptional guy. The book bounces you between the past, written from Lily's diary, to the present. In her diary, Lily talks about Atlas, a child without a home, without a family. Lily helps Atlas, she sneaks him to her house, lets him take a shower, gives him clothes, watch TV together, eat, talk, get to know each other. The connection between them is definitely special. But I guess everything has an end- or... doesn't it?When Lily and Ryle enter an upscale restaurant, Lily encounters Atlas, after so many years, and discovers that he has managed to create and bring his life to a good place.Sounds like a cliche love story to you, right?So it's not.I don't want to do spoilers, so I would be very careful. it’s a book about strong love, with problems that quite a few women get into a cruel situation. There are women who manage to take their feet and walk, and some do not.Our main character, Lily, who is indeed a special hero for me, is going through jolts, ups and downs. Will her love succeed in overcoming logic? Or could logic make it better for her love? You know, a lot of people tend to say, ""Oh, come on, to me it won't happen, I'll never get to that.""Well, it might not. But it can be. Whether it's a man or a woman - whether you're on the violent or innocent side. You can get into that kind of situation. We all can.This is a book that should reach a wide audience - men, women, adults and more. This is a book that teaches a terribly important lesson in life.You know, I learned about that in psychology and sociology. Freud talked about it - it's called a defense mechanism.This is a situation where the person starts to make a “rationalization”. It operates by the subconscious mind. The person may even not be openly aware of it, but only in the subconscious. It is very difficult, and I can talk about it for hours, but I can’t do it here lol.To sum up, that’s why this book is so important.So of course I highly recommend this book. Have a good read, my loves."

“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.” 
I am a mess. Torn. So, so goddamn conflicted. Broken over the what-ifs of this book. Filled with sorrow. Proud. I feel manipulated. Tricked. Heartbroken. Educated. Thankful. Mindfucked. It Ends With Us is nothing like I’ve ever read. It certainly isn’t like any other novel Colleen Hoover has written. The word ‘DIFFERENT’ is just etched into its very essence. I feel like Colleen put part of her story and her soul on a silver platter for us to observe and draw our own conclusions from it and this also became evident within the Author’s Note which, by the way, I wholeheartedly encourage you to read. Hell, no. Scratch that. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ IT ENDS WITH US. Not because of the hype. Not because of the romance. Not because of Colleen’s awesome writing skills. But because of the message. I cannot guarantee you’ll love it. I’m definitely far from loving it and I don’t even think it’s Colleen’s best work. This is the second book that’s ever made me feel the ‘I-love-it-but-I-hate-it’ vibes, the first being Dusty. I rated that one with 3 stars because based on my logic 1 star equals hate and 5 stars equate to love so the average of 3 will do. But I rated IEWU with a full 5 stars rating because if there’s one word to describe this book, then it’s EMPOWERING. And WOMEN EMPOWERMENT deserves 5 stars any given day. Plus, its unraveling is perfect.Without being spoilery, I will say this: this book is heavy. This book knifes your heart and twists it until you bleed all your pre-conceived ideas about certain topics straight out the window. I loved Lily. I loved Ryle. But most of all, I loved Lily & Ryle. Their relationship is so complex and layered and I was overwhelmed with feelings at just how perfect they were together. I laughed, I smiled, I felt my heart catch wings and head into the clouds. And then I cried buckets. Then there’s Atlas, which I did not fall in love with, but he just fit the puzzle perfectly and after a while I found him so lovable as well. And yes, I loved Lily & Atlas too. They were like a weak but brilliant rainbow after a storm.
“In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.” 
Now, now, don’t rush and believe this is some love triangle. I just feel evil now and I will say that YOU HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA MUHAHA. *sobs*I’m not saying more because you should definitely head in blind with this one, as I did. Honorary mentions are needed, however: Alyssa, I swear, she’s the best friend I could possibly imagine; I cannot comprehend how difficult it must have been to say and do some things considering the unique dynamics of her with the other characters; Marshall was another great addition that simply showed how easily men can empower women too; and Lily’s mother is a glorious character. And I will share this: there was one particular scene that left me crying like there’s no tomorrow. The last hospital scene. That beautiful and so very ugly and just 100% gut-wrenching scene. Where decisions were made in the hopes of a better future. Where letting go was worth the love you’ve built piece by piece. Where the cycle of history stopped. Where I had to put the book down and start a sobfest. It gutted me, completely and utterly gutted me. 
“And as hard as this choice is, we break the pattern before the pattern breaks us.”
I read this book in 5 hours. I finished it 24 hours ago. I still can’t stop thinking about it and my stomach is still churning like ashes have taken residence there. I’m an emotional mess. I feel unsatisfied, yet content. Enraged, yet peaceful. This book shows the good, the bad, the in-between. It shows life and love and hatred. It shows how love can become a poison. It shows how love can shackle and hurt, but also save and heal. Honestly, it blew my mind. It doesn’t matter that it made me uncomfortable or that it made me wish things ended up differently. This story needed to exist exactly as it is no matter how broken my heart feels. It is brave and bold.It’s an eye-opener. I realized upon reading that I might have been indifferent or dismissive or downright judgmental regarding some statistics (this sounds weird, I know, but you’ll get it once you read). I never fully grasped some scenarios or some perspectives, but It Ends With Us changed that. It changed me, undoubtedly. And for that, thank you, Colleen. Thank you, Lily. Thank you for making me a better person. "
1703,4.0,"i just finished this a few minutes ago and had to collect myself. everyone told me i would cry while reading this book, and i didn’t, but i still loved it a lot. it was very emotional, and gaining access to the stream of consciousness of a domestic violence victim was very powerful and poignant. atlas is also a king, and i want him. the last line too omg i teared up. all in all, it’s a great book.update: thinking back to this book, i really didn’t enjoy enough for a 5/5, so i dropped it one star. good book, though.

❝I wish cutting my feelings off for the person who hurt me was as easy as I used to think it would be. Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.❞

It Ends With Us was beautifully complicated. It was hot and cold. Up and down. Good and bad. Beautiful and ugly... I'm still trying to figure out how I really feel about it all because I'm genuinely torn on how I want to perceive this storyline. I loved it but in all honesty, I really do think I hate it as well. Not the ""I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-stop-writing-books-and-find-a-different-career"" type of hate but rather ""I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-for-making-me-hate-everything-that-I-came-to-love"" kind of hate because it pretty much summarizes all my thoughts and feelings about It Ends With Us in one sentence.My opinions were completely divided. One side of me, the hopeless romantic, was utterly unsatisfied and angry with the outcome of the story. The opposite side, the one that's all about women's empowerment, was cheering on #TeamLily like it was Independence Day.(view spoiler)[Rather than trying to sugarcoat my thoughts, I'm just going to be completely honest. I was 100 percent team Ryle from the very first time we met him. Just like Lily, I fell in love with every word and every gesture that rolled off of his body. I. WAS. HOOKED. It also didn't help that I kept fantasizing Doctor Mike as Ryle Kincaid. *heart eyes emoji* I loved his ambition. His personality. His confidence. To be honest, I think I might've loved Ryle even more than Lily did but that's another story for another day. That more than likely explains why I took the second half of this book like a blow to the gut.Once we got to the second half of the book, that's where it started going a bit downhill for me as a Ryle and Lily shipper. Every happy moment that ever happened between my ship came barreling down as it collided with pain and abuse. I was angry. I was thrashing. I was yelling at the pages in front of me, ""Why are you doing this Colleen?!"" But most importantly, I was just heartbroken to see such a beautiful couple become so toxic. Everything I loved about the first half of the book was slowly unraveling right before my very eyes as if it never really existed in the first place. I can't even remember how many times I wanted to put the book down because my hopeless romantic self just couldn't handle it anymore. But I just kept on reading because I was guiltily hoping that Ryle and Lily would still have their happy ending despite all that had happened. :/ Sadly, this was where I was torn the most.I have the upmost respect for Lily. She is definitely one of my favorite female characters that Colleen has ever created because she did what a lot of us would've struggled to do in the end: walk away. Lily was such a strong character and I admire her so much for having the strength to stand up for herself. There were numerous times towards the end of the book where I knew I probably would've gave in and forgave Ryle for his actions but Lily was inflexible. She was in a tough position but she put her foot down and demanded better for herself. In the end, no matter if I ship Ryle/Lily or Atlas/Lily, I'm glad that Lily was able to find peace for her and Emmy.As for Atlas, I liked him but I didn't love him. Definitely nowhere near my love for Ryle. I wasn't exactly rooting for Atlas but I wouldn't have minded if Lily chose him in the end. However, I still very much preferred Ryle regardless. I just felt that Atlas was the typical knight in shining armor. Typical good guy you run to. His background story was interesting but him as a character... not so much. He just felt so ordinary and predictable. I wanted to ship Atlas and Lily because let's face it, the signs were practically being shoved down our throats, and although the relationship between Ryle and Lily was developing, Atlas's presence was a like a thorn on your side you just couldn't shake off. But I just couldn't bring myself to ship them blindly like I did with Ryle and Lily.Unfortunately, I was too far gone and too far in love with the idea of Ryle and Lily to make room for Atlas and because of that, I'm not sure if I'll ever be fully satisfied with that ending. I was happy that Lily was no longer a victim of domestic abuse. I'm glad that after all that happened between them, Lily and Ryle parted on good terms. I'll forever be heartbroken over the idea of what could've been. And I feel indifferent to Lily and Atlas. Sorry not sorry, Atlas. That basically sums up all my feelings in a nutshell.To be honest, I was actually feeling a bit more bitter than I'm making it seem after that ending. But after reading the author's note, it really put things in perspective for me and made me look at the story with brand new eyes. I developed a new understanding and appreciation for the story behind the story.I was dying for Ryle and Lily to have their happy ending. Until the very end, I was still rooting for them. It's such an ugly confession to make especially when the couple you're rooting for is toxic and abusive. And I think I feel this way because I never, and hopefully I never will, had to experience abuse. I don't know what it's like and what goes on in the minds of the abused. Colleen did such an excellent job at creating the perfectly imperfect man that was Ryle. Abuse in books has always been a trigger for me and if it were any other book I think I would've put this book down by the first incident of abuse. But Colleen just made you fall so deeply in love with a character that even you couldn't bring yourself to hate him even if you wanted to. YOU were the Lily of this story. But unfortunately, I don't think my Lily would've had the courage to leave. I really wish I could say that I would leave in an instant, but I think I would honestly be lying to myself. You can tell yourself that if you were in Lily's position you would leave in a blink of an eye, but things wouldn't be as easily said and done if you were the one who was actually experiencing it all. And in truth, I think this is exactly what Colleen wanted us to actually sit down and think about because victims who've experienced abuse wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. I wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. It just goes to show how much of a struggle it really is to walk away from someone you love and loves you back in all the wrong ways. I usually never read the author's notes after the book but I'm really glad I took the time to read Colleen's story. It really did make me see the situation from a different perspective. (hide spoiler)]I'd been having a bad CoHo streak for three books in a row (if you're curious, the books were — in order — Hopeless, November 9, and Too Late) and for a moment there I was beginning to think that I was doomed to never enjoy another book written by Colleen Hoover again. But PRAISE. It Ends With Us restored my faith completely in the CoHo hype. Not that I was ever planning NOT to read any more of Colleen's books! Colleen Hoover is 100 percent my favorite auto-buy author. I will always buy her books no matter if I end up loving them or not, and with good reason because Colleen is such an exceptional writer. It Ends With Us still wasn't able to top Ugly Love as my favorite CoHo book of all time but I really enjoyed this book more than I thought I would."

""Everything Shatters. My tears, my heart, my laughter, my soul. Shattered like broken glass, raining down around me."" 
At least now the title makes sense! Boy, do i have a few thing to say about this It Ends With Us! When i decided to give this a second chance this is not what i had on mind. It wasn't supposed to happen, damn it. First of all, this Goodreads synopsis is misleading. It needs to be replaced. Whoever came up with it deserves getting fired. What is the matter with GR users?! First, ACoMaF wins ""best YA fantasy"" award, then this.. THIS!! won Goodreads Choice ""Romance""? What's wrong with you people?! Let's get one thing straight, THIS IS NOT A ROMANCE! This ""award"" was the reason why I've been somewhat skeptical for this long. Why i was so disappointed in Hoover's other book, Ugly Love, is because THIS is what i was expecting from Ugly Love. This has it all. This is what i call love at it's worst. Don't get me wrong, there were love and a dreadful ""love story"", I still won't call it a romance. I can't thank enough Hoover for not romanticizing abusive behaviors. Thank you, Colleen! No, i am not someone who has dealt with anything like this personally, but i am someone who always asks the question ""why stay with someone if aren't treating you with the respect you deserve?"" I'd like to say i am a bit more aware that it's not always that easy. Still not fully convinced, but a little closer. baby steps, people, baby steps. First half was a bit boring & fairly predictable, to be completely honest. It felt like just another typical CH romance. In fact, it wasn't until the last quarter when i started seeing what Hoover was aiming for. Lilly is a very strong character with hidden depths. I am astonished & extremely proud of her. Ryle, on the other hand, is much more complex. No, i don't hate him. If anything, i'm grief-stricken. The ending was perfect. That's what impressed me the most. Last but not least, thank you, Mary, for putting up with me. Thoughts 20% in,*If some random person literally gets on their knees & begs you to ""fuck them"" even though you've repeatedly declined such generous offer, that's a giant red flag. There is an extremely high chance they are psychopathic. What you should do is, RUN! RUN FOR YOUR DEAR LIEF. Not swoon.Buddy read with this sweetie pie, MaryI've read 3 Collen Hoover books so far but unfortunately, none of them i found to be very impressive.Hopeless. ☆Slammed. ☆ ☆Ugly Love. ☆ ☆ You know what they say, 4th time's the charm. Keeping my fingers crossed."
1706,5.0,"Dear Ellen DeGeneres,I should probably start out with an apology. I don't think I've seen a single one of your talk show episodes all the way through. I catch five or six-minute clips here and there posted every so often on Facebook, and I have loved every single one of them, so I don't know why I haven't watched more. You're totally awesome. And another confession: I haven't seen Finding Dory yet, either, even though I loved Finding Nemo. So, yeah, I'm sorry about that too.But I'm so curious right now if you've read It End With Us by Colleen Hoover, since you know, you're such a big part of the story. The way she incorporated you into everything, with the ""just keep swimming"" line and watching episodes of your show and the writing letters to you thing to show the backstory, that was really weird but also different and unique (sorry, I know those two words mean the same thing, but I had to use both anyway). I ended up liking your role in the book a lot. But I'm beginning to believe CoHo has a really evil, diabolical brain. She schooled me so bad.I went in thinking...well, I don't even know what I went in thinking. But I know I don't think that way anymore. I think my entire way of thinking has changed. I tried to compartmentalize. Oh, this is going to be a romance story. Well...it was and yet it wasn't. Then I thought it was going to be a love triangle like Maybe Someday was, and yet it totally wasn't. When the heroine Lily started going back and forth in time, telling two stories about a girl falling in love with two different boys in two different portions of her life, I thought it was going to be another version of Ugly Love, except maybe twisted with Lily taking on Miles's role. But it totally wasn't.This was not a light-hearted story. It was not an easy, feel-good, happily-ever-after that you can crawl into to escape from reality story. It didn't even have a real definitive HEA. I can list all kinds of things that it wasn't and didn't have, but I can't pin-point exactly what it WAS and DID have, except maybe a lesson in life. I feel as if I just lived what Lily lived through. I feel as if I can never victim blame again when it comes to an abused spouse. I can never automatically think ""why did she stay with him?"" because now I know why. All because of Colleen Hoover's diabolical evilness, now I have experienced falling in love with one of those guys and being hurt by him and loved by him, and yet still excusing and forgiving his actions, not just once, not just twice, but every time. Right up into the very last chapter of the book, I was okay with whatever decision Lily made to stay or not to stay with him, because he really wasn't a bad guy. He just did some bad things. And what she did decide was good, but sad, and yet...I don't even know. But I was okay with it. So yeah...I'm really curious how you feel about being mixed up in all this heaviness and serious-issue business. Personally, it's not the kind of story I usually like to read. Stuff that's just too real like that usually gives me hives, and I doubt I want to go out looking for any more stories like this, but I can't say I regret it either. It was just that amazing and just that powerful. Like I said, I was totally schooled by it, and now I go forth with a different outlook on relationships and love and hurting the people who are the closest to you. But I wouldn't want to be schooled this way with every book. I really do need that unrealistic escape more often than not.But I think it was really neat how important you were in the lives of these characters, Ellen, just by being famous and throwing out some witty lines like you do. It really makes you think how everything you say and do can make such an impact on a complete stranger's life, just like Colleen Hoover has now made in mine. And now I feel the need to find some light, fluffy, happy crap to console myself with after reading that life-altering experience. Thanks for listening to me babble!Many hugs and happy reading,Linda Kay "
1707,5.0,"I don't know what happened with this review. It wasn't whole, the likes gone, and the conversations about the book was gone. The audio re-read was great!! Used my bookmark! ♥This book chewed me up and spit me back out. I said I wasn't going to cry, I cried a little. NO SPOILERSThis book is very deep. It touched on some strong subjects. I would like to add so many excerpts (good and bad) but I'm not going to do that either. I would like for those that haven't read the book yet to go into it without knowing too much. There are two people in the book I didn't like, one is from Lily's past (her father) and one is from her current life (Ryle)I very much loved: 1) Atlas2) Atlas 3) Atlas4) Allysa5) Marshall6) Brad7) Darin8) Jimmy9) Lily's MomObviously, I really loved Atlas because I added his name three times (there are not three of him). Allysa is Ryle's sister and Marshall is her husband. Allysa becomes best friends with Lily and helps Lily with the opening of her flower shop and works there with her for some time. Brad, Darin and Jimmy are characters that are only in the book for a short period of time, but that short period had me laughing out loud and I really needed that with all of the deep stuff in the book. Lily's mom had many issues to deal with but I still loved her because she was a good person. Letting bad things happen to you doesn't make you a bad person. The story goes back and forth from when Lily was younger (teens) and when she's a little older. There are a lot of bad things that happened in her childhood. She also meets Atlas when she's a teenager too. They both have troubles they are going through but they had a wonderful bond. I'm going to leave it at that because there are so many strong emotions I have over this book, I'm afraid to say anything else. I loved it and I hated it. And it has the most wonderful ending! I'm am so very happy with that ending ♥♥ Fin ♥MY BLOG: Melissa Martin's Reading List"
1708,5.0,"Audiobook:Agree.. agree... agree... with all 3,743 - 5 star ratings!!!!!!! I didn't think it would happen...but there came a point when tears were welling in my eyes. I was absolutely exhausted from this mornings hike. I took a little deep sleep afternoon nap - When I opened my eyes, I found Paul resting beside me. I said...""do you mind.......LISTENING TO THIS AUDIOBOOK""? I was still too sleepy-tired to put my eyes to work reading from my kindle or a physical book. Plus ....I knew I was almost at the very end of this story. Paul said, ""sure"". He had listened to part of this book on our drive to and from Felton early this morning- to ""Fall Creek""... where we hiked 2.5 hours. He was aware - taking in - much of this story too. Right when the issues - messages - of this novel had hit me the hardest-- Paul was lying next to me. HE HEARD WHAT WAS GOING ON. - WE DISCUSSED THE issues - at some point - later - but at that moment, I turned off the audio - not wanting to get to the VERY END...even though - by now - I KNEW WHAT was coming .....and I reached for Paul to snuggle. I had never felt more grateful and thankful. I wanted to cry - didn't - but felt an urge. I WISHED I COULD TELL EVERY WOMAN ON THIS PLANET THAT I FELT CONNECTED TO THEM!!! My quiet moment of being in Paul's arms were comforting.... (my mind was swimming with thoughts - while emotions were circulating through my body). This HIGHLY RATED NOVEL is NOT ""The Great Gatsby"", ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", ""Anna Karena"", ""Ulysses"", ""Jane Austin"", ""Steven King"", ""Gone With The Wind"", or even ""Harry Potter"".......SO WHAT IS GOING ON??? Personally-- I think it's so well written -- we aren't aware of the writing at all. The writing seems invisible- WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE- but TRUE. -- The story is a breathing entity: a living being.  ....what I'm sad about -- is that it took THIS BOOK ( an author I had never read before - pre- judged & pooh-poohed as a chickie-light-weight-mushy-author) ---to KNOCK SOME OLD RIGHTEOUS MARBLES OUT OF MY HEAD!! I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY WOMEN WOULD ***EVER*** STAY IN A RELATIONSHIP IF THEIR PARTNER HIT THEM!!!! ( even once). Wow..... I get it: ITS COMPLICATED!!!!!I'm still not sure if I'll read any other books by ""Colleen Hoover"", or not, but this book deserves all those high ratings. I'm transformed from this journey. Another 5 star rating from me too!!!! A HIGH 5 star rating!!!!!! *note: I honestly don't even consider this a review. It took me 3 minutes to write-- it came straight from my heart---and there's no effort in that!!!"
1709,2.0,"For those of you who think this is a love triangle. It's not. TRIGGER WARNING : (view spoiler)[It's a story of abuse and she is never with both guys at the same time. So not a triangle.  (hide spoiler)]--------------------------------------------FULL REVIEW ALL SPOILERS HAVE BEEN MARKEDIt breaks my heart a little to say this, but I think it's time I broke up with Colleen Hoover's books. Her first few books are some of my favorite books of all-time, but her latest have been very mediocre and not to mention, frustrating. I went into It Ends With Us with an open-mind, but I still found the book to be trite and I felt a little bad for feeling so meh about it given the context and background of the story.Let me get one thing out of the way. Colleen Hoover is talented. Ridiculously so. There's absolutely no doubt about that. Her writing is beautiful and evocative and she's an author with a ton of potential. However, I sincerely believe she hasn't explored her full potential yet. Maybe it's because she's writing too fast, but despite the topics that she's been handling lately, her books haven't been as strong as her debut series. My biggest complaint when it comes to It Ends With Us was how over the top it was. I get that people in real life have all kinds of issues, but if you're not going to give equal and considerate attention to each issue that you're tackling in a book, then it winds up just being messy. In It Ends With Us, EVERY single character had something seriously messed up happen to them. And I do mean EVERY. There's the homeless suicidal boy, the abusive parent, the boy who shot his brother in the brain when he was 6, the infertility issues and so much more. It's TOO much. It's almost as if the author decided to add all these topics to make the book forcefully emotional, like she tackled all of them just so readers find it an emotional tearjerker. If it had focused on the one big issue, it would have been a much much more powerful story, in my opinion. I have read books in the past that were simple in their writing but were all incredibly emotional and made me cry because of how subtly and beautifully they handled the one main topic that they explore. Taylor Jenkins Reid and Melina Marchetta are examples of two such authors who do this brilliantly.And I don't know guys, this book read very pretentious to me. I'm finding this to be a trend in Colleen Hoover's books lately. I mean just look at those names. Atlas? Ryle? Lily Bloom? I mean seriously? Some of those names are supposed to be funny, but they were very distracting and took away from the story for me. And then there are the letters to Ellen DeGeneres. The protagonist is a huge Ellen fan and addresses all her journal entries to Ellen. I'm a big Ellen fangirl, and I loved that Lily loved Ellen too, but ehh the journal writing felt a bit much for me. Oh and my personal favorite? (view spoiler)[ Lily names her daughter Dory after the freaking fish in Finding Nemo. Am I the only one who thinks this is just weird??  (hide spoiler)] There was also the cheesiness factor which was amped up like nobody's business. I can tolerate some amount of cheese, but this author takes it to a whole new level. The scenes between Lily and Atlas, especially were nauseating. (view spoiler)[Atlas who is homeless and secretly moves into the abandoned house next to Lily is just about to kill himself, when he decides not to because he sees the light in her bedroom and she looks like ""an angel"" who has come to save him or something. Is this supposed to be romantic???  (hide spoiler)] Don't get me wrong, they had some really good romantic scenes, but the whole story was bogged down by cliched lines.I'm also very annoyed at how misleading that summary is going to be for some readers. This is NOT a love triangle. (view spoiler)[I'm not sure why this book is being marketed as a love triangle, because it isn't one. In fact, this needs to come with a trigger warning because it tackles domestic abuse. It just feels like another ""ooh let us try to shock the readers by not mentioning one of the relationships is abusive"". I'll admit the abuse part of the story was handled well and it was clearly a very personal story to Colleen Hoover, but yet, I also felt like it disappeared with all the other issues. Honestly, I'm not even sure what Atlas' role was in this book. He seemed to be there as a consolation prize for Lily at the end once she got away from her abusive relationship. Sure we get to see them as teenagers falling in love, but we don't really get to see them reconnect afterwards and I was disappointed with that. Ryle being abusive was very clear from the first scene he was introduced. I do like how Colleen Hoover went about with his portrayal. It was subtle and felt very realistic. That's why I think this could have been really really good had it only focused on the domestic abuse that Lily underwent.  (hide spoiler)]So yeah, this review isn't very cohesive, I apologize for that, but my thoughts are definitely a mess when it comes to this book. If you're a Colleen Hoover fan, don't worry about my rating and review. Considering the fact that 99% of all the other reviews are 5 star ratings, I have no doubt that It Ends With Us, like every other book by the author, will be a tearjerker hit among her readers. I know this makes me sound like an utter snob, but I expect much much more from her books and just slapping together a bunch of tough issues isn't enough for me to want to give a book a high rating."
1710,4.0,"4.5 starsThere are so many things I want to say. So many feelings I'm dying to share.And way too many thoughts clouding my mind.This is definitely a book that needs to be discussed thoroughly, but not in a review. Not at the chance of ruining the experience for someone else. This is one that you’ll want to share with your friends, your sister and maybe even your mother. At least, that’s how I felt. Whether or not you ever find yourself in this situation, chances are, you might know someone who is. For me, the beauty of this book was the author’s ability to change my perspective. To go from a place of judgment to one of confusion, agony and ultimately understanding. It made me step back and look at a situation that should have been cut and dry or black and white and consider every shade of gray. I’m not going to lie, my headspace was a complete mess and my heart ached. I wanted so desperately for things to be different. For things to be easy. For the right choice to be blatantly obvious. To forgive and forget. To give in to those feelings and accept the bad with the hope that the good would somehow make up for it in the end. This story really hit home with the notion that love is what makes things hard sometimes, not the hurt. Love has the power to blur the lines of acceptance. 
“Naked truths aren’t always pretty.”
MY NAKED TRUTH: I told myself awhile ago, I was done with CoHo. That I would never read another of her books, ever. And there was a part of me that almost managed to forget the addictive quality of her writing. Almost. I can honestly say, this was a powerful book. One I’m better for reading. It managed to make me look at things a little differently and I love that. I appreciate that. So thanks, Ms. Hoover.*Complimentary copy provided by Atria and NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."

1712,5.0,"*****5 STARS*****This is not my real review, please read the unfiltered review here... https://prettymessreading.wordpress.c...So here the thing...I am struggling writing this review because it hits so close to home. Because of that fact this isn’t going to be written like my normal reviews, it will be about me and Lily. It will be a correlation of our lives.As I read this book the little broken girl inside me started coming out. I wanted to put her back. I didn’t want her resurface. I needed her to go back to her hiding place where the adult Danielle wouldn’t find her… She came out nonetheless.I spent my childhood from 6 months to 12 years old in a 3 bedroom, 2 1/2 bathroom, 2 car garage house from hell. My mother had a job at a warehouse and my step-father owned his own construction company. We went to church every Sunday where my step-father’s brother was the preacher. We were clean, never hungry and went on family vacations. It looked perfect from the outside. But the inside was a completely different story.Unlike Lily, my step-father’s abuse reached my brother, sister, and me. I learned from an early age how to take a few blows from a man. It became so normal that they didn’t even hurt anymore.But let’s talk about It Ends With Us…I fell in love with Ryle during the beginning of the book. He was sexy, smart, good in bed – everything I girl could ask for. He was attentive even with his busy schedule at the hospital. He worked for Lily’s heart and never took her love for granted.Lily was funny as hell. I loved her from the first paragraph. I thought, “This is a chick I could rock with.” Plus she was a red head. My inner lesbian has a thing for red heads. She was a badass. She was a woman who knew her self-worth and I loved that about her.When the two of them came together it was pure magic. Here’s this man who doesn’t want anything that resembles love in his life but couldn’t help himself from falling in love with her. That’s one of my favorite things to read about and to see in real life.Atlas, Atlas, Atlas! He was just… perfection! I want an Atlas when I grow up. I really enjoyed reading Lily’s letters to Ellen Degeneres. Getting inside Lily’s head, seeing Atlas the way she did made me love him too. I became so conflicted as to who I wanted Lily to be with.

From this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part.”Maybe those vows weren’t meant to be taken as literally as some spouses that time.For better, for worse?Fuck.That.Shit.

I’ll be honest, it was hard to hate Ryle. Even after everything he did there was a piece of me who hoped he could change. I think that that scared little girl in me wanted to believe he would stop, like I prayed my step-father would.This is one of those books everyone has to read for themselves to find their voice on it. It's not a book to be reviewed, it's a book to be felt.Follow all my crazy...Blog https://prettymessreading.wordpress.com/Instagram https://www.instagram.com/prettymessr...Facebook https://www.facebook.com/prettymessre...Twitter https://twitter.com/prettymessread"
1713,4.0,"I am so glad I read this book. It is one of the most hard-hitting books of all times I would say. It's realistic, relatable and happening.Domestic violence. The one theme that is really important but we choose not to discuss much. The victims accept it most of the time thinking it's their 'fate' and I can understand why we find it difficult to leave the so called 'abusers'.Until it happens to us, we find it somewhat difficult to believe the hurt and the truth that we as victims face. The trauma is real and it stays with us forever. The writing style is really good. The character representation is so damn amazing and it's so clear like the dark blue ocean. You will grasp it and will feel the deepest emotions that lie beneath the words. The chemistry between the characters is sizzling and dark and honest.The ending is so damn satisfying. I am so in love with this dark, realistic read. The plot is simply real and raw.I would like every woman to read this book once. We all need to read this book once!Atlas. He is my favourite character. I will trust my instincts more and help the less unfortunate in times of need. What touched me the most about this read:The characters saving each other at unexpected moments of their lives. Why don't we make it happen more in real? It doesn't take much. We don't have nothing much to lose when we do so.This book has changed a few things about the ways I used to believe as 'normal' being a woman. Yes. I will make my life and my family's life better by taking a stand of my own. Thanks, Colleen Hoover."
1714,5.0,"SPEECHLESS. This book left me completely speechless. It's why this review will be far from eloquent and admittedly a little short. I've been staring at the cursor as it blinks in silence on my computer screen, trying to come up with a review for this unbelievably complex, astonishingly real, and heart wrenching novel. I can't decide what I want to tell you and I think that's because I really 
don't want to tell anything at all.
I went into It Ends with Us with a clear head and absolutely no idea on what was going to happen. It's best that way. This novel is one of those reads that simply knocks you out cold. It's a heavy handed, physical blast to the feels (aka: emotions). You cannot catch your breath while reading. It's settles you into an easy reading pace, makes you feel good, cocoons you in it's warmth, and then when you think you're happy and safe, you're not. It EVISCERATES you. It tears you down piece by piece until you're left confused, torn, broken, thinking, ""I can't believe this is happening. I don't believe it. I don't want to believe it."" I still can't get over it. I still can't process the fact that it threw me so off center. And when I describe this book to people, I keep repeating, ""It's heart breaking, but hopeful."" And I know that doesn't seem really comforting. It doesn't tell you much at all. But here's the thing, I don't want to get into Ryle or Atlas or Lily or the characters in this book. I don't want to break them down piece by piece. I don't want to plant seeds or ideas in your head. I don't want to influence your reading experience. I want you to go in. I want you to READ. I want you to EXPERIENCE it with the same innocence and naivety that I did. I want it to sucker punch you. I want it to ruin you. I want it to heal you. I want you to 
LIVE
 this through Lily's eyes, heart, and mind just like I did. And I feel as though saying anything to you, about anything, is a spoiler. And that is why this review is so pathetic.

1715,4.0,"My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...Wow!I am a bit late to the party for this one. I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't been said already. This was my first CoHo book and it looks like I picked a good one to start with. It's surprising but even though the book had already been out for a while, other than hearing that it was very emotional, I didn't actually know what it was about. I am happy I was able to listen to it without knowing very much. It didn't take very long to see where the story-line was headed. The book's main theme deals with a very delicate and important subject.I can understand the variety of feelings this book brings out in different people. I've seen reviews from friends that absolutely love this book and some from friends that really didn't care for it. I can see both sides. I fall in the middle but more towards really liking it. Does that make sense? I don't know... but that's the best way I think I can describe how I feel about it.I've now listened to handful of audio-books and I'm really enjoying them. I will always love to read books but on those days where I have a headache or my eyes are bothering me, it's awesome to have this choice. In my opinion the narrator for this novel did a wonderful job.....Olivia Song (Great name too!).""It Ends With Us"" is a heartbreaking novel that deals with sensitive and extremely important issues and I think that Colleen Hoover handled it well. Sometimes you have to tell yourself...“Just keep swimming.” "
1716,4.0,"4.5 STARS[image error]Colleen Hoover delivers a story that is not only thought provoking but will indeed get those emotions running amuck. Lily Bloom’s story is told well with wit, heart, and a fantastic cast of characters. Fans of this author will not be disappointed in the presentation and heart that she has placed in this book.
 ‘Imagine all the people you meet in your life. There are so many. They come in like waves, trickling in and out with the tide. Some waves are much bigger and make more of an impact than others. Sometimes the waves bring with them things from deep in the bottom of the sea and they leave those things tossed onto the shore. Imprints against the grains of sand that prove the waves had once been there, long after the tide recedes.’
In chatting with friends and reading other’s opinions on the outcome of the story I’m left with so many, hell too many conflicting feelings. (view spoiler)[ I do think Ryle was redeemable if the author so wanted however I got the pain of what became of their love and survivors need never to go back. (If anyone has a shot of fighting his abusive infliction it would be an extremely intelligent and educated man who has a solid family to support him and a strong will and reasons to do so.) From reading the author's note for the third time last night she wanted to pattern him around her father but her father was an alcoholic who if I read it right didn't help her mother financially when she left or the kids. I think perhaps she didn't go hard enough with Ryle's character because I do think a therapist would find all his qualities, smart, driven, no drug or alcohol problem in the mix, strong support system and will to change a perfect patient to overcome his rage. Also, Atlas was so darn convenient just there on the outer rim of this story waiting to bounce back into Lily’s world. Don’t get me wrong, I liked him a lot but the love connection for me was with Ryle not her childhood friend. Though the ending between Ryle and Lily worked for me it was heartbreaking yet real and I cried and cried for them. To my shock it seems that I read this one a certain way and double the number of friends read it as Atlas and Lily’s love story from the get go. Crazy Right but the easiest way to see where you fall is how you answer this question - Was this a hea?  (hide spoiler)] So you can see my confusion yet the author’s skill in leaving both impressions to be received by readers.

1717,2.0,What I didn't liked? Everything What I liked? The ending
1718,5.0,"*COMPLETELY SPOILER FREEEmotional.Incredibly insightful.Empowering.Eye-opening.Not to mention completely original.It Ends With US is filled with such raw truths I had to stop a few times and just think about a line or passage I just read. It is filled with SO many heartbreaking moments I didn’t think my heart could endure it all.I read this book a few weeks back, and it has stayed with me since. As cliché as it sounds, it is truly one of those stories that will surely stay with me for a very very long time. It made me question things and situations I never thought I would even think twice about. It made me love people I didn’t think were worthy of love and forgive things I didn’t think were forgivable.As always with Colleen’s writing, each of her characters has a distinct voice and each story has a distinct message. It Ends With Us, for me at least, reminded me how easy it is in life to point a finger. To judge someone or a situation you are on the outside of. So easy to say, “If that was me, I wouldn’t have done that.” But this story shows us that sometimes certain situations aren’t that easy to walk away from and become even messier when emotions and love are involved. 
I applaud Colleen so much for writing a story like this. In fact, she deserves a freaking standing ovation.
 In a world with MCs, twists, and plots that are all so similar they all begin to mesh as one, It Ends With Us stands out with its personal, exceedingly touching, and original storyline.I don’t want to say anything on plot or characters. I read this not knowing a thing on either, and was shocked to see how it unfolded. And even though I won’t elaborate on any details and in turn my review is very brief, I really think those who go in blind will appreciate the story and the insanely strong emotion behind it that much more. Go in with an open mind. Go in with an open heart. But be warned this story will probably break it.It Ends With Us is out August 2nd! | http://amzn.to/2ah7LuM

1719,5.0,"""Maybe love isn't something that comes full circle. It just ebbs and flows, in and out, just like the people in our lives. -- Just because we didn't end up on the same wave, doesn't mean we aren't apart of the same ocean.""Colleen Hoover is my favorite author, and this is without a doubt my favorite book from her. I finished reading this book months ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about this story and these characters. This story is so incredibly important and moving and emotional, and this book feels so raw and real. I love that each one of these characters has flaws, some bigger than others, but all of them feel so realistic and have so many layers to them. In this book we follow Lily Bloom, a young girl living in Boston where she meets a Neurosurgeon Ryle on the roof of a building one night. They share a lot of ""naked truths"" as they call it where they share some brutally honest secrets about each other, and I easily fell in love with both of these characters and their chemistry right away. Lily wants to own a flower shop and create her own business and she comes from an abusive home, where her Father abused her Mother. ""No one is exclusively bad, nor is anyone exclusively good. Some are just forced to work harder at suppressing the bad.""As we follow Lily and Ryle's love story, we get flashbacks of Lily's teenage-hood when she fell in love with a homeless boy named Atlas. Lily starts all of her diaries with ""Dear Ellen"" and writes her diaries to Ellen DeGeneres which I thought was super awesome. Atlas is one of my all time favorite male characters, he's so sweet and humble, and innocent and he deserves all the best in the world. I am in love with his character. The flashback chapters kind of reminded me of Eleanor & Park with the way Lily and Atlas would ride the bus to school together, and Lily is a red head just like Eleanor. I thought Lily was so sweet for taking care of Atlas, who was secretly staying in a vacant house next door. Their relationship started out so innocently and grew into one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever read. (view spoiler)[I love how their relationship grew so gradually. It started by inviting him over to take a shower before her parents got home, just to help him out since he was homeless. Then, he started staying to watch Ellen with her after school everyday, and then she took care of him when he had the flu, and those scenes were so sad but also so sweet. I love how he would watch her plant and she would tell him how ""plants reward you based off of how you treat them, like human relationships."" Then Atlas was upset because he agrees ""if they are mistreated they might end up homeless and incapable of anything meaningful."" But then she shows him the tree in the backyard that grew all on its own and says ""some people are strong enough to survive without anyone's help and grow all on their own"" and it was such a beautiful metaphor I was crying. I loved how she took him into her room at night to sleep on the floor instead of the cold empty house. That was sad when she realized he didn't even have blankets or anything, he was just laying on a towel on the floor. ): Then they watch Finding Nemo and ""just keep swimming"" became their new life motto. I also love when he made her cookies and surprised her by showing her he can cook. Then when he gave her the tools from the vacant house even though he has nothing, it melted my heart. He's so fucking sweet and generous. Their relationship started as a friendship and slowly grew into something more and it was so pure and beautiful. I love how he tried to help her when she would cry about her Mom being abused and he was always there for her. And that awful night when Lily saw her Mom getting raped and Atlas had to physically stop Lily from using the knife on her Dad. That was so sad and intense. I was sad when he said he was moving to Boston with his Uncle but happy for him at the same time to finally have a home. I loved the way Atlas talked about Boston, like he was so proud to be from Boston and he always said it was the greatest place in the world and Lily noticed he still has a slight Boston accent. Then, of course that night when Lily and Atlas finally had sex and Lily's Dad hears them and comes crashing through the door, wielding a bat and nearly killing Atlas. ): Those scenes were so fucking sad and it reminded me of Forbidden to be honest. I can't believe that was the last time they saw each other in nine years. (hide spoiler)]I love all the first chapters with Ryle's character. His sister Alyssa and her husband Marshall are two of my all time favorite side characters. They were just so funny and entertaining. I love how Lily always talks about Ryle wearing his scrubs as a doctor and having the ""steadiest hands in Boston"". I also love how passionate Ryle is about being a doctor and he's so driven and goal-oriented. (view spoiler)[That bar scene when Alyssa finally tells them she's pregnant was so cute! I was shocked to find out that Ryle and Alyssa had an older brother, who Ryle accidentally killed. Now Ryle has crazy black outs because of it and anger issues. As I was reading the scene where Ryle first hits Lily, I was completely shocked. I re-read the part over and over making sure I was reading it right, and my mouth was hanging open. I did not expect this book to dive into topics about abuse like this at all. I was shocked because I had fallen in love with Ryle's character and as soon as he slammed her into the wall, I was stunned. I didn't think he was capable of it to be honest and I can't believe he would do that after all Lily has been through with her Dad doing the same shit to her Mom. I was also surprised by how genuine his apology seemed and for a minute I honestly believed he wouldn't do it again either. When Atlas and Lily finally crossed paths again at the restaurant I was screeching with excitement. That scene when Atlas see's them and he looks from Ryle's hand to Lily's eye and puts two and two together was so intense. Ryle has the fucking nerve to say: ""This is the homeless boy you pity-fucked?"" And I nearly lost my shit. I was like AW HELL NO. I love how Atlas was so protective of her in that scene and he threw Ryle out of the restaurant and told her to leave him, it was so sweet. Then the next day when Atlas came to apologize and give her a gift and he gave her an Ellen DeGeneres signed book with the personal message: ""Lily, Atlas says just keep swimming. - Ellen DeGeneres"" like oh my god alskdjlaksa my heart nearly died in that moment. If I wasn't already in love with Atlas's character I definitely was by that point. I was kind of surprised that Lily agreed to marry Ryle on a whim in Vegas, especially because he had already hit her once at that point. That scene when Ryle pushed Lily down the stairs made my stomach turn. Especially when he claimed she fell and she kept mentioning how he sounded more like a doctor instead of a husband. Ryle just gets jealous so quickly and starts calling her a whore for no reason at all and it's really sad. I couldn't breathe while I was reading that scene where Ryle is asking her to read the newspaper with Atlas's article about why he named his restaurant BIBS (better in Boston) and Atlas said it's a tribute to someone he loves and cares a lot about. But then Ryle got so incredibly mad at her and he headbutted her and I couldn't believe it. I was crying so hard because Lily didn't know who to call and Ryle has gone full blown crazy and Alyssa went into labor earlier that night and had the baby so there was no one to call except Atlas. That was so sweet how Atlas instantly knew it was her and dropped everything to come get her. Then when Lily found out at the hospital that she was pregnant with Atlas sitting right next to her I was like alskdlakjsla NO. That scene was written so well, I love how the doctors just casually mentioned how they can't run x-ray tests on pregnant women and she was like what??? I love how subtle it was, I stopped in my tracks and re-read that part because I thought I read it wrong and then I was so shocked. I love how Atlas doesn't judge her at all and he lets her stay at his house for as long as she needs, and it's kind of a full circle with the way he used to depend on her for shelter and now she depends on him, it's so sweet it makes my heart hurt. I love how they watch Ellen episodes together just like they used to and he cooks for her and writes ""just keep swimming"" at the bottom of their notes. Atlas is so fucking sweet, every scene he was in I was swooning for days. When Lily finally sat down and wrote another diary entry to Ellen as an adult, I started crying again. She confessed she was in love with a man who physically hurts her and it was so depressing and sad, but beautiful at the same time. That was so sad when she confessed to her Mom and to Alyssa that she was pregnant but also that Ryle was abusive and she didn't know what to do. I respected Alyssa so much more when she said: ""As your best friend, if you ever take him back I will never speak to you again"" and I think it's really sweet that she has that kind of support. And when she finally has a deep discussion with her Mom about what it's like to be with someone who hurts you constantly. That scene at the end when Lily gives birth o the baby then decides she wants a divorce from Ryle minutes later was so intense and powerful. I was crying when Ryle realized he would never want his baby daughter to be with a man who hurts her and he finally realizes how terrible he's been to Lily. Then Lily just tells him that it happened to her Mom and it happened to her and it would not happen to her daughter because ""it ends with us"" and it was so powerful and I love that the book is titled that. I love that they name the baby after Ryle's older brother, Emerson and Dory is her middle name because of the finding nemo thing. Then, finally nine months after the baby is born Atlas and Lily run into each other and they are just so fucking cute and they make me so giddy. Then it ends with: ""You can stop swimming now Lily. We finally reached the shore."" And then I cried for like 10 days because aslkjdlakjskla they are so cute and Atlas is so cute and MY HEART. (hide spoiler)]This book was so raw and heartbreaking and it was completely different from all of Colleen Hoover's other books. This book was absolutely incredible and one of the saddest books I've ever read, but also one of the most beautiful stories I've ever read. This book deals with intense themes like: drug use, abuse, rape, death, all of it, and yet it finds the silver lining in the sadness. Atlas is quite possibly my favorite male character in existence, I just love and adore him so much, I can't say it enough. This book has affected me on a personal level and an emotional level in a way that few books ever have. The writing style is paced so nicely and I loved how it flowed so easily between the flashback chapters and the present chapters. This book has stolen my heart and I don't really have the words to describe how incredible this book is. It's unlike anything I've ever read before and it has two insanely beautiful story lines going on at the same time that collide in the most amazing way possible. This book is going to speak volumes to young women everywhere and I love the message that this book gives. It's so powerful and honest and I'm so proud of Colleen Hoover for taking on a topic like this. This book is phenomenal and I can't say enough positive things about it. I already want to re-read it and I read it three days ago.""Imagine all the people you meet in your life. There are so many. They come in like waves, trickling in and out with the tide. Some waves are much bigger than others. Sometimes the waves bring with them things from deep in the bottom of the sea and they leave those things tossed onto the shore. Imprints against the grains of sand that prove the waves had once been there, long after the tide recedes. That was what Atlas was telling me when he said I love you. He was letting me know I was the biggest wave he'd ever come across. And I brought so much with me that my impressions would always be there, even when the tide rolled out."" REVIEW BEFORE RELEASE DAY: (written in May 2016)I was provided an ARC from the publishers.Oh my god, I finished this book late last night and I can't put into words how much this book has moved me. Colleen Hoover is my favorite author and I absolutely love all of her books but this book is easily my all time favorite book from Colleen. This book is exceptional and heartbreaking and it's so incredibly raw and real. I haven't cried this much while reading a book in a long, long time. This book is so important and I love the message it sends. Not only is this one of the best books I've read this year, it's one of the best books I've ever read in my life. It's only been a day since I've finished it but I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since and I know this book will be on my mind for so long. This is unlike any of Colleen's other books and she said herself that this is her most personal book to date and it really shows. I could feel the emotions jumping off the page. I sat on my couch and finished this book in one sitting because I could not put it down unless I knew how it ended, and I'm glad I did because this is the kind of book that deserves to be devoured in one sitting. I also feel like this book is even better when you go into it knowing absolutely nothing like I did, because every little plot twist is extremely shocking and amazing. I will post my full review closer to the release date but, my god Colleen this book is phenomenal.Also, I created a playlist for this book of songs that I think go really well with the book, check it out here: http://8tracks.com/itsgabbyg/it-ends-..."

4.5 Naked truth  STARS

 -Es este el mejor libro de Colleen Hoover?  No, no lo creo. -Es mi libro favorito de ella?  No, para nada. -Lo recomiendo?  SI, TODO EL MUNDO DEBERIA LEER ESTE LIBRO (posible exageración mía). Esta es una historia muy compleja y difícil de afrontar, si piensan que Too Late fue una historia demasiado cruda y obscura, esta historia es aun más, pero de una forma mas seria. La mayoría de reseñas dicen que es mejor leer este libro sin saber de que va, yo lo hice de eso modo, y si ustedes quieren esa experiencia les recomiendo que dejen de leer mi reseña en este momento. SPOILERT ALERT  Cuál es el tema principal de este libro, con una portada tan linda? La violencia doméstica.  La autora repite varias veces una frase muy cierta, una critica a la sociedad, una critica a ti, a mi y a todos los que en algún momento hemos juzgado a una mujer que permanece en una relación donde hay abuso. Cuantos de nosotros, no hemos dicho en algún momento de nuestras vida, ""si ha esa mujer le pega su marido es su culpa porque no lo abandona"", o ""que tontas son esas mujeres por seguir con alguien que las golpea.""

""People spend so much time wondering why the women don’t leave. Where are all the people who wonder why the men are even abusive? Isn’t that where the only blame should be placed?""

Esa es una realidad difícil de entender y asimilar, que me llena de vergüenza, pero dejen me meto de lleno a la historia. Lily, la protagonista es un personaje hermoso, bien construido. Una mujer independiente, que creció viendo a su papa abusar de su madre, por lo que tiene bien claro que quiere hacer con su vida, sigue sus sueños, cumple sus metas, y es feliz. 

""I love it when the sky makes me feel insignificant.""

 Lily conoce a Ryle. Los primeros capítulos vemos desarrollarse la historia amorosa entre Ryle y Lily, los vemos enamorarse, los vemos pelear contra esos sentimientos, los vemos divertirse juntos, los vemos ser felices. Rily es un personaje con muchísimas capas, pero igual te enamoras de el, obviamente es guapísimo, es un doctor exitoso, lleno de aspiraciones. Y que se enamora tan fuerte que no podemos dejar de sentir las mariposas en el estomago, igual que Lily.Luego tenemos el primer arrebato de Ryle contra Lily, solo es un empujón, y si me siento mal al decirles que al igual que Lily yo también justifique esta acción. Luego viene otro incidente mas fuerte, aquí fue cuando mi corazón se empezó a romper y al igual que Lily quería mandar a Ryle a la mierda.

""I am in love with a man who physically hurts me. Of all people, I have no idea how I let myself get to this point.""

Pero la autora siendo cruel como es, nos da otra justificación del temperamento de Ryle, y si ya se lo que están pensando, que tonta la prota por darle otra oportunidad después de 2 abusos. Pero la justificación que utiliza es muy fuerte, es intensa, es comprensible, es algo que para mi mente y la de Lily llega a tener sentido. Los protagonistas se casan, pelean, encuentra una manera en que Riley controle su temperamento y no hay mas incidentes, y como dije aquí viene una parte que no les va a gustar. Lily y Ryle son mayoritariamente felices, están enamorados, ambos tienes trabajos exitosos haciendo algo que aman, tienen increíble sexo juntos, la familia de Ryle adora a Lily y ella a ellos. Los momentos felices sobrepasan los dos pequeños incidentes.

""“You are my wife . I’m supposed to be the one who protects you from the monsters. I’m not supposed to be one.”

Luego llegamos al climax, Riley pierde la cabeza otra vez, su temperamento se desata porque ama demasiado a Lily y no puede controlar sus celos, todo se sale de control, pero Lily escapa. Después de esto Lily al igual que yo (especialmente yo que leí esto a las 3 de la mañana), estaba echa un mar de emociones, Lily se entera que está embarazada y todo es mucho peor, esa escena que me hiso derramar un par de lagrimas.

""No matter which option I choose—whether I choose to stay or choose to leave—neither are choices I would wish upon my child. To grow up in a broken home or an abusive one? I’ve already failed this baby in life, and I’ve only known about his or her existence for a single day. ""

Lily sufre una batalla emocional, quizá para ustedes y la mayoría de personas haya afuera es fácil decir, que lo abandone y ya, abandonar aun esposo abusivo es fácil, pero darte cuenta que también estas abandonando a alguien con el que compartes hermosos momentos, a alguien que te hiso feliz, a alguien que amas, a alguien con el que estabas creando una vida. Y si insúltenme lo que quieran, pero me sentí mal por Ryle al verlo sufrir por la separación, entendí sus justificaciones, aunque obviamente no las perdono. 
NO ESTOY DEFENDIENDO A UN ABUSADOR, PERO SIENTO LASTIMA POR EL. 
Quizá si nunca han estado enamoradas esto les cueste mas trabajo de entender o ponerse en la piel de Lily, yo si lo hice, justo en este momento me lo estoy reflexionando. Qué pasaría si mi esposo al que amo con todo mi corazón, padre de mi hija, con el que he estado casi 10 años, un día perdiera el control y me golpeara? Qué haría yo en esa situación? Honestamente no lo se, y rezo con toda mi alma nunca pasar por algo así. El personaje de Atlas, fue mi personaje favorito de la historia, es adorable, pero la historia NO era sobre el, y creo que su personaje salió sobrando un poco, sufrí por su adolescencia y lo ame con todo el corazón. Creo que la unica razon de el, es dar esperanza, mostrarnos que aun en las peores tragedias es posible salir adelante, recordar que solo tenemos que seguir nadando. Adore las menciones de la pelicula de Buscando a Nemo.En conclusión: Gracias Colleen por escribir este libro. No se si cambio mi vida, pero sin duda me hizo ver una perspectiva nueva, me hizo ver como es que una mujer llega a ese punto en una relación toxica, me hizo respetarlas. Creo que cuando llegue un punto en mi vida en el que cruze caminos con una mujer que vive dentro de una relaciona abusiva, mi primer pensamiento no será juzgarla, mi primer pensamiento será escucharla."
1721,3.0,"Me and Colleen Hoover just don’t vibe together. Something about her absolute refusal to use trigger warnings due to her belief that they ruin the “integrity” of books, whilst abuse is a frequent plot point in her books will never make sense to me. This criticism is in no way an attempt to invalidate anything Hoover personally has experienced, because I’m aware this book is close to her heart in many ways. Yet, I can’t shake the feeling of how strange it is to hold such a mindset as she does. Feel free to share your thoughts below, I’m interested to see other opinions regarding this. (I also would like to add that I myself am a survivor of abuse, and am diagnosed with PTSD. As such, I will not allow anyone to attempt to invalidate my stance in regards to this.)"
1722,5.0," I’m not capable of writing a coherent review at the moment. There are a million thoughts inside my head but I don’t know how to put them into words. How many different emotions can humans experience? Because I’m pretty sure I felt them all while reading this book.I thought this would be another sick-lit book. I was wrong. Still, it must be one of the hardest books I’ve ever read. It had a huge impact on me. It both destroyed me and healed me. But most of all, it scared me. I was scared that the heroine would make wrong decisions, that the ending would be wrong, that I would be left inconsolably devastated.It ended right. Give this book a chance. This is Colleen’s best book to date. It will make you think. It will make you proud. It may inspire you. It may change your life.

1723,5.0,"There are very few stories I can honestly say feel like an experience and this is definitely one of them. As readers, we are given a unique perspective into a very difficult issue. One that unfortunately, is not all that uncommon. Ms. Hoover doesn't take the easy route either. No. We are drawn in. We commit to the characters. We feel their love. We feel their devastation. We feel their heartbreak. We feel their confusion. We feel their healing. To say this is an emotional rollercoaster is an understatement. I won't lie to you and tell you that you won't have your heart torn out right along with the heroine. That is what makes this story so powerful. Your comfort zone will be tested. You might even feel things that you would never have otherwise associated with the topic. That's what I found so impactful. The introspection I was forced to face: that things are not black and white and that those murky gray areas can be devastating. I admit that I was hesitant to pick this up, sensing that like my friends, I would be subject to an involuntary emotional cleanse. However, I can't bring myself to be anything but appreciative for this story. It's a story that belongs to many: those who made a similar choice as Lily, those that didn't, and those that have paid the consequences when they weren't the one to make the decisions. If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would do so in a heartbeat. Safety: No OW/OM/Sharing despite H's belief to the contrary. The story deals with abuse. There is an attempted rape. "
1724,5.0,"YA'LL, MY HEART!!!!!!!!! Gosh, this book! I LOOOOVED IT! Absolute massive props to Colleen Hoover for writing this book! "
1725,4.0,"First and foremost, this book needs to have trigger warnings for physical abuse and attempted rape. I understand the shock value packs a much bigger punch, but this book needs some disclaimers. It feels pretty gross that this book is marketed as a love-triangle romance from the synopsis. Now that I got that off my chest, I did like this book. Colleen Hoover is always hit (Confess) or miss (November 9) with me, but she is mostly a hit and always an auto-buy author for me. I think she's a really talented author, and she has one of the best personalities in the book world. Also, her author's note at the end completely gutted me. 

“In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.”

Without giving too much away, this story is about a girl who finds herself still fighting the demons from her past. This book is in no way a love triangle, but we do get glimpses of her past love while watching her fall in love with someone new.This book deals heavily with how easy it looks, from the outside, to leave an abusive relationship, and how far from the truth that really is sometimes. This book in no way glorifies abuse or excuses it, but forces the reader to see feel the struggle abuse victims feel when being in love with their abusers. It's pretty eye opening, and I think worth a read for anyone, because most books involving abuse don't even come close to handling the situation as well as CoHo does. This book is realistic, and heart breaking, and eye opening.Mini-rant on why I gave this book four stars: (view spoiler)[ I hated Ryle from the very first encounter with him. This is the sole reason I'm giving this book four stars, because my hatred for him started way before his abuse: Who in the fuck tells a girl he wants to fuck her, and when she says no he asks what it will take, then shoves his hand up her shirt to make out with her AFTER HE LEARNED SHE IS GRIEVING FROM JUST GETTING BACK FROM HER DAD'S FUNERAL? I don't give a shit about this ""naked truth"" game; this guy was a shitlord from the first encounter, and just kept becoming a bigger shitlord throughout the entire book. If we were able to see more happiness/closure with Lily getting with Atlas at the end, I would have probably given this five stars, but the epilogue wasn't enough. I wish she would have got with Atlas during her pregnancy. (hide spoiler)]

“Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.”

This book also has an amazing female friendship that is sort of unconventional. This was one of my favorite parts of the book, even though one part was a little unbelievable for me. Allysa truly was the real MVP of this book, in my opinion. My biggest complaint, besides not having trigger warnings, was the name of these characters. Like, I'm all about unique names, but this story was way over the top: Lily Blossom Bloom, Ryle, Atlas. Like, please, let's not. Obviously, I'm not going to mark the book down over this, I just feel like it was something that needed to be said, because I felt like the Lord was testing me, personally, with these name choices.

“Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.”

Also, this book made my ugly cry a lot. I mean, a lot, a lot. So, you've been warned. Blog | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Youtube | Twitch "

*Spoiler-free review*
I have a confession to make here, folks:I dismissed Colleen Hoover years ago and I haven't read anything from her since.It's true. Three or four years ago I went through a string of so-so to bad Colleen Hoover books, and I decided to just put her out of my mind. I ignored her new releases, and I lumped her into my mental pile for authors who are ""not for me.""Recently, one of my friends wanted to buddy read this book. I thought, ""Gah, pay full price for a book I'm not going to like?"" However, I sucked it up and sort of grumbled about it, but I decided to give it a go. And this book blew me away.The Colleen Hoover I last read wasn't writing books at this caliber. This was a whole different level. For one, there are none, and I mean NONE, of the tired romance tropes presents in this book. In fact, this book was a little more woman's fiction than romance, if I'm being honest. While I guess it can still be classified, genre-rules-style, as romance, it is more about Lily's life experiences and the lessons that she learns about herself than anything else. There is a romance present, but I don't think it is the main focus of the story. While I'm not typically a women's fiction fan, I think that if this book took any other trajectory, it wouldn't have been as powerful.I typically don't read reviews before starting a book. In fact, I didn't even read the blurb for this one, or if I did, I forgot it before starting to read. I liked that. I think going in blind with an open mind and minimal expectations is the way to go. Though the twists and turns aren't 100% unexpected, the author very much succeeded in pulling the rug out from under me on more than one occasion. I'm usually not a fan of books where people say, ""Wow, that made me think. This book is a thinker."" I usually just roll my eyes internally because I assumed that the readers are being played like emotional pawns. I know, I'm judgy. But in this case, yeah, I was thinking a whole hell of a lot. It made me reevaluate how I perceive others and their relationships, and it made me rethink my biases. People are always know-it-alls until they are in the situation themselves, and then it doesn't seem quite as simple.The author made one right decision after another with this story. I think that is the key to its success. The author made a relatable, human character in Lily, and gave each supporting character their positives and negatives. There are no villains here. No easy answers. Colleen Hoover also made an insanely smart decision to have only Lily narrate the story. There was no other choice, really, but it gave readers a laser-focus on her, which is where our focus deserves to be. While this book has a positive ending, it is also a story that can be described as gritty, difficult, hopeful, powerful, and crushing, all at the same time. It is a long story, but it has a fast-pace, with plot elements thrown in at the right times to keep interest engaged. I couldn't put the book down from the moment I got into the groove, and I read this story all night until the last page. The dedication is also important to read, but make sure you do it after you've finished the story and not before. Colleen Hoover impressed me so much with this story. It made me rethink a lot of things, but most of all, it made me rethink how I judged Colleen Hoover years ago. I won't dismiss her so easily again.  "

One thing I do not understand is why Kyle isn't going to therapy and getting help for his peoblem? He clearly needs it. And he can afford it.

1730,5.0,"(Regular Review) This book tells us the story of Lily, Ryle, and Atlas. Lily is a businesswoman who moved to Boston after graduation. Ryle is doing Neurosurgery residency in Boston. Both of them accidentally meet together one day and fall for each other. Atlas is Lily's first love who suddenly reappears in her life. After a long time, I enjoyed reading a romance novel. But this book gave me a totally different experience compared to my favorite books.
After reading 50 pages 


 My rating at that time 1 star  I was wondering what Ryle was doing. The author said that he was doing Neurosurgery residency. But he was behaving like a roadside Romeo and a kindergarten child at the same time. 
After 100 pages 


 My rating at that time - 3 stars Colleen Hoover slowly fleshes out the character of Lily, and the story slowly starts to become interesting here.
After 150 pages 


 My rating at that time - 2 stars  Cliches and smut regularly seen in romantic novels start appearing here. The author slowly but steadily falls into the bandwagon created by the writers of the new generation.
After finishing this novel 


My rating at that time - 4 stars The novel ended in the best way possible. The author could have easily gone for a more conventional ending that might have satisfied more readers. But she decided to follow her heart and wrote a fantastic latter half for this novel
After reading the authors note 


 My final rating - 5 stars  After you finish reading this novel, please don't forget to read the author's notes in the last part of this book. Colleen Hoover is telling her personal experiences and opening up her heart there. I was thoroughly impressed with what she wrote there. After reading that, I understood that I couldn't give any rating less than five stars for this book. I can never call this a perfect novel. There were many areas in the initial part that I detested a lot. However, the author brilliantly managed to bring everything back on track with her brilliant writing skills. She is discussing some extremely important topics, like domestic abuse, in this novel. She is also giving a great message to the readers through it. I can easily say that it is one of my favorite romantic novels I read in the last few years."
1731,5.0,"This book…. This damn book. It left me speechless. I don't think I have ever loved a CoHo book more than I do right now. This book was everything to me and it left me feeling a whole bunch of emotions. Once I finished the author's note and acknowledgements, you sure as hell know I was freaking balling my eyes out (I'm a crybaby). Also, I may have texted everyone in my contacts to go read this book now or we can't be friends anymore.It Ends With Us is a such a strong, powerful, and emotional novel. I can't express enough how much this has changed my outlook and perspective on (view spoiler)[those who have been abused or (hide spoiler)] just life, in general. (view spoiler)[I always wondered why women, even men, always stuck with their spouse when they did such horrific things to them. However, now in the eyes of Lily, I could perceive that they did so because they were in love. (hide spoiler)] Viewing the story through Lily’s eyes made the book a lot more emotional because whatever she felt, we felt too. Whatever emotion she felt at whatever moment, that was how we felt too. I fell in love with Ryle ever since the moment on the roof. I fell in love with him more and more each time, but I'm not going to say much more like others because I want everyone to experience everything on their own. This book is worth it. Also, once you read the book, I would recommend that you read it again because even though you know what's coming next, you have another chance to actually decipher the emotions and dialogue. This is one of the few books that have changed my perspective on certain topics. I will never forget this book and the author’s note. That author’s note was the end of me. I, as a person and a reader, would like to appreciate and applaud Colleen Hoover for writing this because this must've been so hard for her, but she did it and I believe this is one of her best books yet. There's this one quote in the book that will also stick with me forever, but I don't want to explain what it means to me. I want you to interpret it yourself. “There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”Once you finish this book, I'm warning you that you're going to have a book hangover and trust me, it's going to be horrible. I'm still going through that process. Now, please excuse me, while I go reread this and ball my eyes out some more."

I'm telling you guys, this book is Colleen Hoover at her very best!I have read Colleen Hoover books in the past and they really have such a huge impact to me, but nothing compares to this novel. It's a different take on sensitive issues. And somewhat personal. Colleen Hoover did an amazing job in giving us a glimpse of what it is to have a different outlook in life, family, and relationship. To live in constant struggle. To hate someone dear to your heart and to even feel an ounce of compassion to that person despite your remorse. It very much pucks an emotional punch.

""I fell like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down we're all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding than others.""

Lily's character amazed me the most here. What she's been through in her childhood... it was awful. But I can say that she grew up as a strong person despite it all. I was awed by her determination to live a life far away from her mom where there are so many painful memories that correspond. She didn't want to experience a life similar to her mom's so she kept reminding herself never to become like her in the future.This book delivered such a deep and sensible message that particularly targets women. I thought this is a very important book and everyone should read it because it has a say on something so personal. I fell into the story so easily and at times, I found myself taking a break in the middle of some chapters to reflect and... sob. There were just so many different kinds of emotions emanating from the pages which is of course, typical Colleen Hoover's magic. 

""You make me want to be a different person, but what if I don't know how to be what you need?""

And when I learned in Colleen Hoover's note that this story is inspired from her mom's experience, I fell harder and I wept. I haven't read as good and as personal as this book and this is really remarkable for me. It's something special.

""Not everyone is homeless because they chhoose to be. They're homeless because there isn't enough to help to go around.""

Atlas's character was also unforgettable here. I loved him. Every time I think about him my heart squeezes up so bad I feel like crying. And Ryle... I thought he's also a character that felt real to me. I especially loved his naked truths. I also thought Lily's write-ups in her journal are one hell of an emotional ride. 

""No one is exclusively bad, nor is anyone exclusively good. Some are just forced to work harder at suppressing the bad.""

There are so many things that I wish to say in this review but I'm afraid they will serve as spoilers so to wrap it all up, I'm in love with this book. It's everything and then some. The plot was fairly unpredictable and there were so many lessons entwined that will shake you emotionally and ruin you and turn you into a mess. Another spectacular job, Colleen. Thank you for sharing to us this wonderful piece of journey!

""And when I whisper, 'I love you, too,' it's the most naked truth I've ever spoken to him.""

1733,4.0,oh my god oh my GOD IM A MESS NOBODY TOUCH ME --------pre reading:i'm going along with everyone that recommended me this on my latest status update which was a request for my lovely gr friends to help me choose a book <3so... all my friends have rated this 5 stars. let's see how it goes!
1734,4.0,"4.5 stars. Well fuck, I honestly did not expect this book to be this mesmerizing and enthralling. I am so happy my first CoHo book did not disappoint, but instead had me in a huge puddle of feels and haunting my thoughts 24/7. This book has left me thinking about some heavy topics and so attached to the characters AKSDJKBFQLJFBWILU, I can't even English. I'm so shook by this, you guys don't even know! If you plan on reading this I suggest you stop reading my review right here and go into this knowing nothing. Also, this is going to contain huge spoilers so read at your own risk! I didn't really know what this book was about. I've heard it dealt with an abusive relationship, but I never really cared to check out the blurb or read reviews of this. I was just living under my rock, not knowing that a powerful, awe-inspiring and gripping book like this existed. Honestly shame on me for not reading this so much sooner. I seriously hated the beginning. You know it was the usual, ugh-this-shit-is-boring-when-is-you-getting-better?? and I wish I can go back in time and smack myself really hard in the fucking face for reading this so slowly in the beginning. I admit, I had a hard time with the beginning. It seemed like every other contemporary where girl meets hot boy who does one night stands, but then falls for girl and they get into a relationship, but as I read on it became impossible to put down and everything started making much more sense and got extremely captivating. I really found Ryle and Lily annoying in the beginning. I couldn't find myself caring about how they like each other and want to fuck each other and feel this attraction. I was just like yo can y'all just get a room, fuck, and get it over with? It pissed me off because I was annoyed at them - and like I mentioned before, I wasn't really sure what this book was about. I was waiting for something to happen which is why I was dreadful towards the beginning. As the story progressed, I started to hate less on these characters and started to really like them more! I know, that some people really fell head over heels for Ryle from the start, but I didn't really love him. Sure I sympathized him for what he did, but I couldn't find myself to love him and find him hot. What I loved most about this book was the journal's young Lily wrote to Ellen. In those journals, Lily's past was revealed slowly, which included Atlas in it!! I love him so fucking much asjkbdlqwkjefbowqi. He is legit perfection and I want a man like him in my life. The journal entries were the most interesting for me and I absolutely loved them! I, personally fucking hate when books have journal entries or letters in them and tbh I always skim or skip through them, but this fucking book made me love the journal entries more than anything.This is very spoiler-y and basically gives the entire ending away so beware!I've seen so many negative reviews and DNF's bc of the abusive relationship portrayed in this book. The reader's who dnfed this book wrote that they didn't want to read more of this bc they hated how CoHo was portraying an abusive relationship as okay. I just want to say that, that's not the case at all. What I believe, the message this book is trying to tell the reader is that an abusive relationship is not okay at all and no matter how much you love your abusive partner, or how much your abusive partner loves you, them hitting you is not right and you should not have to suffer that abuse. I love how Lily realized, that no matter how much Ryle and Lily loved each other, their relationship was not okay bc he hurt her physically. I loved how she left him bc his love was wrong. He wasn't loving her the right way. I'm glad she realized this and left him! And it is written in the book towards the ending as well, if I recall correctly. Overall, this book is fucking amazing and I'm shook. ***Guess who else has never ever read a CoHo book?Yep, this girl right here. I mean, I really like my rock lmao.Well, it starts with us here CoHo. Don't let me down!Thanks to Kimi for the push! =)"
1735,3.0,"2.5 stars......I feel like people are going to be shocked by my rating, even not having read the book- because literally EVERYONE has rated it five stars. I honestly haven't seen a rating lower than that tbh. I get that this is an important story. I'm glad Colleen wrote it. I just didn't connect. I think it's more of a 'it's me, not you' thing going on here. I liked the message, and I did get a little emotional at certain points.. but it just didn't get to me. Call me an emotionless bitch, but I just didn't connect with a single character and I didn't enjoy the overall plot. I think what I realized, is that I don't really like Colleen's writing anymore [but I adore her].That shouldn't be surprising after I reread Hopeless & Losing Hope, and found them to be absolutely horrible. And then reading November 9 & Too Late and pretty much hating them too. But I still had hope.. sigh.Anyway, spoilers from here on out so!!!!~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *Let's start with Lily. What's not to like? Strong, successful, funny. I don't know, guys. Something's wrong with me, I swear LOLL. I just found her to be so boooring. Her personality was basic and bland throughout most of the book & that's all I can really say. What I did love about her though was what she did in the end. Leaving any type of abusive relationship takes enormous strength, and constantly making that decision everyday is so difficult. Not to mention when there is a child involved, and your abuser is as charming as Ryle. ....and Ryle. Never liked the guy. I saw right through him in the beginning. I don't trust guys who say they only want casual sex, no marriage, and no kids... and then suddenly say 'nevermind' in like a month. And even if he wasn't such a piece of shit later on, their relationship developed so quickly [6 months of a relationship where they're both working like crazy???] I didn't have the slow burn I loved. Atlas was my favorite. He's a chef [UM HI], he adores Lily, he ACTUALLY knows her, i loved his friends and how resilient he was. I loved his scenes with Lily more than anything tbh. I wish Lily's child had been his :'(The ending... was bittersweet. I hate when pregnancies are just thrown in there. Like, c'mon. It just sucks to know that someone who abused her will always be part of her life and her daughter's. But I guess it is realistic in a lot of ways because many women are tied to their abusers in some way or another. I'm happy she and Atlas will be together, but disappointed for everything that she had to go through first. *p.s: sorry if this makes me sound insensitive in anyway. i just didn't enjoy the characters or the story. but trust me, domestic violence is something i am very familiar with & i'm happy that colleen talked about this & that so many people have embraced this story.*"
1736,5.0,"Oh. My. God.Colleen Hoover, I don’t know why or how it’s taken me so long to read your books, but that is a mistake I will quickly rectify after reading this one!! I have officially joined your fan club.""...sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all that certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide.""Lily Bloom is in need of solitude so she escapes to the roof deck of a Boston apartment building late at night. Her reflection is broken by the appearance of a handsome man who needs to blow off steam—and kicks a lounge chair into submission. This is Ryle Kincaid, a neurosurgery resident who is having a disastrous day. Ryle and Lily are immensely attracted to one another but he admits relationships don’t interest him, so when Lily tells him she won’t just sleep with him, they part ways.But as their paths keep colliding, and they cannot shake the pull of their attraction, they agree to try a relationship, because they know there is no way they could simply have sex and walk away. They realize how strong their connection is, that their feelings are more than lust, but actually love, and they begin planning to build a life together, as Lily pursues her dream business opportunity at the same time.Lily’s love for Ryle reminds her of her first love during high school, Atlas, who left town to join the military and she never heard from him again. As her relationship intensifies with Ryle, an utterly unexpected incident forces her to confront feelings she never thought she would. And at that moment, she sees Atlas again, which further confuses her heart and her mind, and threatens the life she and Ryle have built.This is a powerful, emotional novel about courage, all-consuming love, empathy, and the realization that doing something bad doesn’t necessarily make you a bad person, but loving someone doesn’t mean you have to love all of their flaws. This book has some steamy sex and some scenes of violence which may be a trigger for some.I devoured this book in a few hours and it seriously choked me up. I won’t be able to get this one out of my head for a long time, and I now must read the rest of Hoover’s books!!See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com.You can follow me on Instagram at  https://www.instagram.com/the.bookishworld.of.yrralh/."
1737,5.0,"Oh my! Argh! This is me confronting my ripped apart heart pieces of mine after reading this book! Actually I read the book a long time ago! I was chickenshit to write a review! Because writing meant opening about my feelings. This book hurt me a lot and I couldn’t find enough words to give true definition of “hurt” it gave me! I honestly say this is my longest Colho reading because I putted it down several times. I got pissed! I screamed! I clenched my fists so hard! I cursed entire family tree of Ryle Kinkaid! I haven’t wanted to hire contact torturers to kidnap a character to give the punishment he’d highly deserved for so long. The things he did to Lily: the physical and emotional abuse he gave her were impossible for me to absorb. I felt breathless and I gave up several times. This book sledgehammered my heart and crushed my soul! I returned my reading because the beautiful love story between Atlas and Lily it’s like seeing sunshine through dark clouds and giving me the only hope I could hold. I honestly thought only reading the flashbacks to warm my heart!  What if they reconnected that night when they accidentally meet again at the restaurant. What if Lily went back after him instead of choosing a path with Ryle. That scenario made me so happy but it would never be the same without tremendous angst Colho threw at us because she is expert to bring our the dirties ugliest cries of regular human being! And without pain and suffer, so much sadness, we don’t feel like we read actual Colho story, do we? Never! This book is in development to adapt into screenplay! It’s so compelling to read this heart stabbing, soul sledgehammering story of this book without consuming tons of paper products to dry tears we may shed. I cannot imagine how the movie will affect me. But sometimes words hurt more than actions and I’m so sure there’s no screenwriter has ability to reflect all those emotions Colho made us feel during our reads.  So my advice: stock entire paper products from grocery stores, lock yourself sound proof room not to scare your neighborhood with your screams and howling sounds and give your entire concentration to this lyrical, insanely heartfelt story. It’s one of the most compelling, sad, sensational Colho book I hardly digest the emotional turmoil it gave me! But it’s worth to the pain. Especially that meaningful, sentimental, poetic ending melted my heart."
1738,1.0,"I just do not like Colleen Hoover's writing. In fact, I hate her writing. This is the second book that I've read (fair enough: only the first that I could finish) and for the second time, she has some squicky judgements about drug use and casual sex. It's oddly shaming and always feels really out of place. Also: and this is such a tiny detail but is just so fucking annoying and stupid I have to mention it. There was this weird emphasis on donating to charities and how that makes you a good person. There's some line about how the Magical Best Friend donates to charities and they built three schools (or whatever) in the last year. And oh my god, the main character actually says that her boyfriend can't be abusive because he donates to charities and she's fucking serious. This is like the stupidest thing ever, like not a single bad person has ever donated money to charity. I actually hated the stupidity of this so much I probably would have given the book 1 star just for it alone. It's not only stupid thinking but it's stupid writing because nobody can be that that naive so why on fucking earth would you write your character that way? And what was all that fucking shit about how there aren't good or bad people just people who do bad things? An abuser is a bad person. He is not a good person who does bad things. He is a bad bad bad person who does bad bad bad things. That is black and white and don't fucking try to tell me any different. Donating to a charity does not make it okay to rape your wife, because that is literally the argument that the main character tried to make. Okay, and here's the thing that really killed the book for me: this was 250 pages of abuse as sexy romance and 50 pages of a boring-ass Wikipedia page on abuse. And make no mistake, this was a sexy romance with a lot of sex. Don't get me wrong, I love me some sexy romance. But when the sex is abusive and controlling AND I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR IS A GOOD ENOUGH WRITER TO HAVE MEANT IT TO BE ANYTHING BUT SEXY AND TITILLATING, it's not sexy sex. I mean, come on, the abusive shithead says he wants to fuck the main character (and says it to her!) as his first line? Yeah, hello abuser. And you know what, I absolutely don't think we were supposed to see this as anything but flirting. Except until we are told to see it as abuse. And that's the biggest problem with this book, that the last fifty pages I was hit over and over the head (hahaha, abuse pun!) with this perfect character who has doubts which totally make her a Real Human but she is a Strong Woman so she will stop the cycle of abuse. It would have been more entertaining to just read a pamphlet from the local women's shelter. Absolutely nothing felt authentic. Every single character was perfect and their lives, excepting the abuse duh, were perfect. Magical best friends appear out of thin air, magical businesses appear out of thin air, and magical success of said business appears out of thin air. And this shit wasn't magical realism so yeah, fuck the magical friends and their magical lives. And fuck this magical Strong Woman who will stand up to her abuser. And here's the one final straw: she didn't stand up for herself, she stood up for her daughter. Sort-of. I mean, we didn't see anything about custody hearings or anything like that, just that Strong Woman allowed this abusing abuser to spend time with his daughter, you know, because he really loved her and wouldn't hit her. Having the main character only tell her abuser no because of her daughter just morphed boring, cliched Strong Woman into boring, cliched Strong Mother. Lifetime Special masquerading as YA romance. Oh, yeah, no spoiler tag here because fuck y'all this book deserves to be spoiled. Spoiled rotten and thrown out with the trash."

""SOME BOOKS ARE WRITTEN JUST TO READ AND FORGET AND SOME BOOKS ARE WRITTEN TO TEACH US SOMETHING AND BE WITH US LIKE A LESSON, FOR OUR WHOLE LIFE. LIKE WE'VE LEARNED IT FROM OUR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE""

No matter how much you wanted the characters to fall in perfect cycle in this book but they can't. Because this not a book to read just for fun or because of your love of books. This is a book to make us realise that sometimes we've to break the perfect cycle to make our future cycle perfect. Sometimes we have to make certain decisions which breaks us at the moment but we thank it happened in the future. Like colleen Hoover said, ""Some risks are never worth taking.""Believe me I wanted so much from this book and from these characters and I wanted nobody to hurt in the end. I was angry, feeling betrayed, my emotions were everywhere. I don't understand that why it happened but in the end I totally understood why this book was the way it is. Because it has to. Life is not a wish granting factory.We have to sacrifice one thing for another, even if we love it with every single fibre of our body. I hated the way this book was proceeding but I know somehow that it WAS important, it was important for us to read, to feel, without experiencing it, and without facing this so much difficult phase that somehow our life is not perfect, Nobody's life is perfect. We have to make it perfect by leaving something perfect.This book ... this book Teached me alot. This was not just a book for me. This was lesson everyone should get in life without experiencing it in real. I know without a doubt that this book will remain with me forever till I am living and breathing. The characters, the feeling, the pain, the heart-ache, i felt at the same time they were feeling, I understood what they were going through.Every word of this book is Mine. I have never called any book mine, but i can without doubt that..

This Book Is Mine.

No one can take it from me. No one. It hurted me so much, it teached me so much, it angered me so much. It wakes so many feelings inside me I have never though exists. For me I was a cold-hearted girl but NO i am not. This book prove it for me that I am not. I loved every character, I hate them as much as I love them. But I don't think I have that much in me to ever re-read this book.But I will beg this whole wide world to read this book. JUST READ THIS BOOK. THIS BOOK DESERVE'S TO BE READED !! Thankyou soooooo much Colleen Hoover , thank you so much for writing this and sharing this with us. I know how difficult it is to bleed your heart open with words. I KNOW!"
1740,4.0,"How exciting is it that this book is being made into a movie!!! 🙌🏼 I’m definitely excited for it! 😁4 It PIERCED me right in the HEART stars for Colleen Hoover's It Ends With Us!This book evoked so many feelings in me. It is the kind of book you want to press into the hands of all the women you love and beg them to simply read. I went into the book having forgotten what it about and that turned out to be a blessing. My blissfully unaware heart was captured, enamored, confused, broken and ultimately filled with hope that sometimes if you ""just keep swimming"", things can change and be better than you dared hope. 
""All humans make mistakes. What determines a person's character aren't the mistakes we make. It's how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.""
This book deals with heavy subject matter and it does so with heart. Lily is the kind of character that you immediately find relatable. You are drawn in to her life and easily succumb to her story. Hoover expertly penned this tale. I was feeling the giddy-headedness of new love and then whoosh! I had the literal rug pulled right out from under me! I was in tears! CoHo, why do you do this to me? I swear it felt like everything Lily was going through was happening to my best friend. I was an emotional mess. 
""Cycles exist because they are excruciating to break. It takes an astronomic; amount of pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern. Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiar circles, rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet.""
I love how the story unfolded between Lily's present and her journals enlightening us on her past. Those journal entries were some of my favorite parts of the story. When past and present connect - magic! I was proud of Lily and her choices for both herself and her daughter. The promise made at the end between mother and daughter - the ugly cry tears were flowing! The author's note explains a lot - don't skip it. This was truly written straight from Hoover's heart. My advice - give it a chance to work its way into yours."
1741,5.0,"siempre pensé que ningún libro de Colleen iba a poder superar Hopeless, porque SI, ese es mi libro favorito de Colleen Hoover, pero todo eso cambio cuando leí este libro, la verdad aun no se como describir este libro simplemente puedo decir QUE ES PERFECTO.este libro es de esos en los que tu te enamoras de sus personajes principales y secundarios, les llegas a tener un cariño especial a cada uno de ellos, porque DIOS son tan bellos, tan bien desarrollados, que no tengo palabras para decirles cuanto ame a cada uno de esos personajes. Lily, Atlas, Ryde, Allysa, Marshall, fueron lo mejor de este libro, cada personaje dio lo que tubo que dar en la historia, hacer que la trama de este libro tuviera sentido, y pudiera tener un excelente narración, porque dios LA TRAMA DE ESTE LIBRO ES TAN FUERTE, DOLOROSA, BELLA, pero definitivamente es de esas historias que quedan grabadas en tu alma y corazon, porque simplemente una vez que terminas de leerlo, comienzas a pensar si todo lo que paso estuvo bien o no, si esas decisiones que tomaron los personajes fueron positivas o negativas, porque la verdad yo si pensé en todo eso, estaba tan impactada por todo lo que este libro logro en mi, me hizo sentir y hasta mas todas esas emociones que sentí cuando leí Hopeless, rabia, desespero, dolor, amor, lagrimas, risas, TODO. (view spoiler)[ desde la 1 vez que Ryle hizo eso supe que no seria la ultima vez que lo haría, sabia que eso iba a continuar y no estaba lista, por que Colleen hizo que amara a ese personaje y que el hiciera eso, rompía mi corazon en mil pedazos.  (hide spoiler)]no quiero decirles mas de este libro porque considero que cada persona debe tener su opinión, sin saber mucho de la trama, y de los personajes, que cada persona viva sus emociones por si misma, y tenga sus expectativas por si mismos, sin tener que leer reseñas para poder decidir si leer o no este libro, PERO DE VERDAD LES DIGO SI QUIEREN LEER ESTE LIBRO Y TIENEN LA POSIBILIDAD DE HACERLO, HÁGANLO DE VERDAD, PORQUE ESTE LIBRO ES DE ESOS QUE MARCA TU VIDA ASÍ DE SIMPLE.

1742,5.0,"I don’t even know what to say. I laughed, I UGLY cried. This book was perfect. The end. "
1743,2.0,"Update 11/07/2018*Le he bajado la puntuación a un dos porque después de leer otros libros de la autora me he dado cuenta de que la actitud de la protagonista no era para retratar el círculo de la violencia, sino otro clásico personaje femenino de Colleen Hoover victimizado por un pobrecito señor abusivo con un pasado traumático al que tiene que cuidar y ayudar Y ESTOY HARTA. Ilusa de mí. ILUSA DE MI*La puntuación real es un 4.75 porque hay cosillas que no me han acabado de cuadrar, pero no puedo ponerle menos a un libro que me ha tenido una tarde sentada, sin mover un músculo, hasta que lo he acabado del tirón.Hay muchísimas cosas en este libro que me han encantado: la bella naturalidad con que escribe Coleen Hoover, la forma en que nos cuenta alternativamente dos historias de amor que se explican la una a la otra, las referencias a Buscando a Nemo, que el momento en que descubres el por qué del título es un absoluto MIND-BLOWN.Es difícil hablar de este libro sin hacer spoilers, porque, al menos para mí, el verdadero tema que aborda la novela fue un misterio hasta que llegué a la mitad del libro, cuando todo cobró sentido de golpe. Solo puedo deciros que me parece muy importante que se aborden estas cuestiones en la ficción y que me gusta en casi todos los aspectos como lo ha abordado la autora (algunos detalles se podrían pulir)Y ahora, es cuando vienen los spoilers y bueno, unas cuantas reflexiones(view spoiler)[ La violencia de género es central en It Ends With Us. Afortunadamente no la he sufrido nunca. Me han educado para que sea una mujer independiente, feminista y luchadora. Llevan dándome charlas sobre machismo en el colegio desde que era niña y me leo continuamente sobre el tema. Quiero pensar que si algún día me viese en una situación de violencia de género, sabría como actuar, sabría defenderme a mí misma y decir NO. Quiero pensarlo. Pero, ¿sabéis que nos recuerda este libro? Que en realidad nunca estaremos del todo a salvo, que, aunque pienses lo contrario, LE PUEDE PASAR A CUALQUIERA. La autora no acude a un ambiente empobrecido y desestructurado que resulte una ambientación facilona para este tipo de situaciones, sino que nos pone en la piel de una mujer formada, con su propio negocio y que jamás habría creído que tolerase un golpe de su pareja, y sin embargo, lo hace. Lo justifica, se culpa, el maltratador logra arrastrarla al círculo de la violencia machista y nosotros vemos cómo sucede. No es tonta, no es ignorante, no es algo que ocurra de la noche a la mañana. La violencia de género es una cuestión extremadamente compleja y es imposible abarcarla por completo en un sola novela que habla de una única historia, pero creo que la perspectiva que ha elegido la autora ha elegido convierte a It Ends With Us en una de esas obras que son útiles para la sociedad. En numerosas ocasiones se habla del perfil del maltratador, de qué le lleva a actuar así, pero esta vez, nos hemos puesto en la piel de la superviviente, y es a ella a quien intentamos comprender y no juzgar. Sin embargo hay algunas situaciones que me hubiese gustado que se planteasen o más profundamente o de otro modo y que han hecho que pierda el 0,25 que le falta.En este caso el maltratador es un reputado neurocirujano. Qué paradójico, que una persona que se dedica a salvar vidas golpee a su esposa. Me hubiese gustado que se plantease la reacción de la sociedad, que la protagonista no hubiese llevado en secreto y con tanta discreción (porque, claro, pobrecito, a ver si va a arruinarle su carrera #SARCASM) para comprobar si la sociedad la apoyaba o la cuestionaba (¿Qué pasa cuando el maltratador es ""una persona importante""?) Lo que me lleva al segundo punto. La denuncia. En ningún momento se plantea en profundidad el dilema entre denunciar o no denunciar cuando uno de los principales problemas a la hora de luchar contra esta enfermedad social es que no se denuncia. De hecho me ha llegado a mosquear que a veces tengo la sensación de que al maltratador se le justifica demasiado (oh, pobrecito, que tiene una historia triste y traumática) y se le aplica poca justicia. Que ese señor que ha agredido a su mujer hasta dejarla inconsciente va a ser padre, va a tener una niña a su cargo, va a salir con otras mujeres y va a tener otras novias en algún momento de su vida ¿no va a volver a caer en lo mismo? ""Oh pobrecito, no lo hace a posta, es que tiene arranques, no controla su temperamento"" Precisamente por eso, me inquieta un poco que este personaje salga tan indemne de sus ""prontos"". Como si no pasase nada.  (hide spoiler)]"
1744,5.0,"Colleen Hoover does it again, she writes another masterpiece, but a different kind. It Ends With Us is a book that will be in your memory for the longest time and you will think about it long after reading it.Thank you Colleen Hoover for sharing such a life changing story. Thank you to Colleen Hoover’s mother for being the ultimate hero in this story. I will never forget this book and your story. You have touched every bit of my heart and soul.This book is important to read for people who have been in abusive or manipulative relationships and for people who have not experienced it. For those who have experienced this toxic environment, it can validate the way you were feeling during the relationship. For those who haven’t experienced it, it can hopefully give you insight on those currently in these situations. It may be obvious as an outsider to be quick to judge the woman for not leaving her partner, but there’s so much that goes on inside of her head.A quote that stuck out to me was said by Lily’s mother, who was married to Lily’s abusive father. She said, “We all have a limit. What we’re willing to put up with before we break. When I married your father, I knew exactly what my limit was. But slowly...with every incident...my limit was pushed a little more. And a little more. The first time your father hit me, he was immediately sorry. He swore it would never happen again. The second time he hit me, he was even more sorry. The third time it happened, it was more than a hit. It was a beating. And every single time, I took him back. But the fourth time, it was only a slap. And when that happened, I felt relieved. I remember thinking, ‘At least he didn’t beat me this time. This wasn’t so bad.’” This is such a common feeling for the victims in abusive relationships. The feeling of relief is present because they know that it could have ended so much worse. After an episode, the abuser apologizes and slowly transforms into the person she fell in love with. It’s addicting to know that there’s still goodness inside of a person who does such harm because one will always be searching for his better moments."
1745,5.0,"Let’s be honest when you start a CoHo book you expect greatness. I think that’s the biggest problem with being an author who always delivers. I begin to expect your next book to be even bigger, even better, even more feels. Well, this book, it was EPIC and I can’t imagine another book making me feel the way this one did. I finished this book weeks ago and I am still not over it. I am still reeling from the feelings I had and I can’t stop thinking about it.It Ends With Us follows one girl from childhood through adulthood. It shows how her childhood made her into the woman she is today. It shows how despite everything you can be brave and strong, you can do better, be better and rise above. You can be the change you want to see in the world. Even when you feel powerless your decisions can change other’s lives. Lily is one of my favorite characters of all time. She is right up there with Kate from Kim Holden’s Bright Side. These characters are not just characters to me, they make me think beyond books and into real life. Lily made me realize my own strength. She made me understand things about myself and even my family. She made me want to be the difference I want to see in the world. I refuse to spoil this book or even give anything away. I will just say, you need to read this book. I think everyone should read It Ends With Us because there is something we can all take away from their story. This story will inspire you and make you feel. It will make you fall in love and question every thing you think you know. Colleen Hoover, you continue to blow me away, like I said I have you on a higher platform than other authors. It’s unfair, I know, but when I start your books I already have unfair expectations. Regardless, of my ever raising standards, you continue to blow me away. Thank you for sharing a piece of yourself with us!

1746,4.0,"➦I'm late to the party. I've been trying to gather enough courage to read this book. After finishing it I can say one thing for certain - it's a very hard book for me to rate. ➦So what's this book about? Women who stay in an abusive relationship. Why aren't they able to walk away? After reading this book you will be able to see that it's not always as black and white as it seems. It sure helped me to have a better understanding of someone in such a relationship. ➦This book is a must read only for the fact that it will make you think about subjects you might never have thought about. Perhaps you won't be quick to judge someone in a similar situation. Perhaps you, yourself, will find the strength to break a pattern if you are in an abusive relationship. ➦Beautifully written and impossible to put down, this story sends a powerful message. And although it was voted the best romance of 2016 here on Goodreads, I found myself not being able to connect with the characters on an emotional level.➦Now, before you crucify me here, remember that #shithappens. I found it hard to completely fall in love with the hero because there were two romantic relationships in this book (not at the same time, no worries) I completely understand why CoHo wrote it the way she did but I think I just needed to concentrate on just two people in love to be completely invested here. ➦I made it through the whole book only to BAWL MY EYES OUT during the author's note. Why? The note was so personal and so real and THAT was what really made me feel and sympathize. So I'm probably in the minority of people here rating this book less than 5 stars.

1747,4.0,"4 StarsThe Naked Truth?: Let’s just say that I was wholly unprepared for this novel. I have been on a COHO kick lately.. “It Ends with Us” is my fourth COHO book, (my 3rd in a month). I had seen several friends give this book rave ratings and so I reserved the audiobook at my local library… little did I know that this wasn’t just a typical romance novel, but a romance with more serious undertones, which I was not expecting. What I loved: Lily Bloom. Her honesty, her diary entries and her obsession with Ellen DeGeneres. Who doesn’t love Ellen? Then there’s Atlas. Talk about an upstanding guy. I also loved the epilogue. Heck ya! What I disliked: Ryle. From the moment he said, “I want to f__ you” upon meeting Lily for the first time, I cringed - they didn’t meet in a bar but on a rooftop of a building on a warm summer day. Ryle is a Neurosurgeon thus I immediately thought what kind of man says that to a grown woman? That right there is not romantic, yet Lily, didn’t seem bothered at all. What I appreciated: Nothing in this novel is cut or dry. COHO did an incredible job showing every side of this storyline, which I think is perhaps exactly like real life. This novel and every intertwining storyline is brilliantly done. The characters got under my skin and made me think long and hard. It also made me remember things I have tried hard to forget. The authors note is so extremely important and I must say thank you to Colleen Hoover for sharing her story and writing this incredibly important novel. “Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.”Thank you to my local library for loaning me the audiobook. Published on Goodreads on 1.1.20."

“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.” 

This review contains SPOILERS, sorry, not usually do a review with spoilers but I had many things to say and could not cover allObviously I adored this book, has high expectations of him and has left me more than happy !.this is one of the best books I've read this year.I would like to talk about this book as briefly as possible because otherwise my thoughts would be eternal :).When I read the description, I don't really expected all the feelings who came to me , although I had already heard from the autor that would be a great challenge writing this book by the very personal content, but then I started to think that's what happens with every book of Colleen Hoover, .
the description tells us, in brief ,about where going the plot, but the truth this time not reveal even half of it, so I'm sure you'll be surprised
I liked the characters alot , the protagonist has shown a lot of courage, strength and humanity throughout history.While male characters show very different personalities, different dreams and different thoughts , which it has done even more interesting to the plot.

“All humans make mistakes. What determines a person's character aren't the mistakes we make. It's how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.”

I want to move quickly to talk about the plot, it is absolutely brilliant, touching such a sensitive issue as gender-based violence is not an easy job, you have to be aware of broach the subject with utmost care and respect. I think Colleen has done it so incredible, each chapter it's heartbreaking and I just felt broken inside me and then I felt doubt and fear and I think I've come to put myself in the protagonist's place, although I have never experienced anything like that in my live, thanks to god, I can share a lot of her thoughtsI was one of those people who wonder, why if the person with whom you are hurts you, why you just don't leave him? . And this is what Lily thinks whenever he sees his mother being repeatedly abused by her father, and were really my thoughts too. Then as time passes and his father dies and it all starts, I really thought everything was left behind and PUM! The past repeats itself and is more than heartbreaking. My thoughts was, ok, you're going to leave him, didn't you?

“Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”

 And she doesn't, and she still convincing herself, in her mind, which is not like her mother, because in a way what she is living ""is not the same thing.""And in a way, I can convince myself of it, and even became so convincing and sure of her thoughts that I believed them too, I wanted to believe that it would never happen and I loved Ryle a lot for that time , because I really wanted believe every excuse that he gave to her and every thought of Lily of that he will change or it would not be like her parents, I really had hopes until the end of that could change, and that they could try to be happy together, and every time Ryle managed to break my heart more and more, I suffered alongside Lily, I felt like she felt , and that connect me in an unexpected way with what was happening.Atlas is a great character, a strong man with a difficult youth, I loved it from the start, although I didn't know what would be her future in the plot, every time he appeared makes me very happy, is a very sweet and gentle soul , and always Lily was his ally for whenever he need it, I love how the lives of these characters is linked, It's as if they find themselves every time they needed it and that is magic. The image of first love as Colleen has told in this story to me seemed very beautiful. I fell in love full of his history, his life and achievements :).“Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.” Anyway, although I suffered a bit, too, on the other hand, I have cast me laugh a lot, has hilarious and unexpected parts, so funny , I've enjoyed of them .I left a handful of beautiful quotes that you going to love, which it is likely to remain your mind
The author's note at the end of the book was valuable for me, see Colleen tell his personal story I filled the heart, its decisions in her life and thoughts and feelings for her family, everything is as strong, deep, painful, but lovable and valuable, recommend 100% reading it, will not regret, has cast a sea of tears from me.


“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”

I want to conclude by, saying that we should not judge people by their deciciones without knowing the truth of the heart, when you love so strongly, is not so easy to leave it and this reading has cast me appreciate that. As well would like to dedicate my greatest respects to all those women who suffer from these ills and have childrens to protect, those are strong, brave and struggling women, who I hope they to have the final they deserve ."

1751,5.0,"(Rating bumped up to 4.5 after a re-read. This has never happened before. !!!!)Note: If you plan on reading this, stop right there and don't go any further. I suggest you dive in blind right into it for this one.Wow. I think I've found my new favorite Hoover book. And that's a statement I thought I'd never be saying after my last few reads by her.This book...god, this book was emotionally gruelling. There's nothing about it that took me by surprise, nothing about it I didn't see coming two steps ahead but when I got there, the anguish slammed into me like solid rock.I didn't cry. I may have welled up a moment or two, but no tears were shed. I only ached. A whole fucking lot. Lily and Ryle's story takes us through the lives of an abuser and abused. It doesn't for a second try and excuse the wrong that's being done—something I was afraid of at one point—but rather it tries to make us understand just why the victim would.Colleen Hoover proves to be the ever undying master of stringing words and tugging emotions. This is an author that knows exactly what she's making her readers feel and knows what to do with it. While I immensely enjoyed her lighter works like Slammed and even Maybe Someday, I'd be lying if I said that THIS isn't her most impressive work yet. You can just sense the pure grief, heart and soul that's pouring out of these pages and reading that final author's note only amplified it even more.But the book does fall short for me a slight bit— and the reason for that is Part Two. In the first half of the book, I found myself riding an insane rollercoaster of emotions from both the intoxicating, budding relationship with Ryle and more importantly, Lily's history with Atlas. For some reason, reading the journal entries as we progressed with their story arc invoked more bittersweet emotions in me than the final half of the book did. Maybe it's because I personally empathized with that situation more. Maybe it's because Atlas and those parts were better written. Maybe it's because deep down, I'm just like the most of us and still frustrated that she hadn't left after the first push. Be it what it may, I'm sure those weren't the intentions Hoover had in mind, but she gets her message across either way.Domestic abuse of both women or men is a territory I've never ventured into before when it comes to books and It Ends With Us managed to leave behind an impact that I won't be able to shake off anytime soon. Or ever.____________________________Book song: Twenty One Pilots – Fairy Local____________________________"
1752,5.0,"I loved this book from very first page and even though I knew I was jumping on an emotional roller coaster (what CoHo book isn't an emotional roller coaster?!), I never could have prepared myself for how this book would change my life. This book is everything I expected from Colleen Hoover but it's also nothing I expected. This book showed me a perspective that I never seen before and showed me new ways of looking at things. It's honest and real and raw. Reading It Ends with Us was more than just reading a book. It was an experience and I've learned so much from it. I've never cried so much while reading a book (and I've never cried while writing a review but here I am, crying while writing this review). This is probably the most meaningful book I've ever read. If you read one book this year, read It Ends with Us. "
1753,3.0,"*3.5 stars*Naked Truth? I hate that I didn't love this...Colleen Hoover has tackled some very important issues in this one, for which I have the utmost respect, but I just couldn't get past the nagging feeling that something was missing. Don’t get me wrong, there was a LOT going on in this story…maybe too much. So much that the plot grew a little rushed, and ultimately unconvincing. I honestly feel this book could have been split into two very powerful stories. I loved its candor… its bravery…its rough edges. I just wish certain issues were given more individual focus, even if that meant leaving out some detail in other areas of the plot. Good read overall, and I do believe most CoHo fans will appreciate, if not love this one. There's no question that this author knows how to give our heartstrings a good tug!"
1754,5.0,"4.5 starsDon't be fooled into thinking this is some fluffy, love triangle romance novel. This is a tough read because of the subject matter. If you can mentally prepare yourself for a difficult read, I think it's important to check this one out. If I could hand a free copy of this book to every woman in this world, I would. And to be honest, I think men should read it too as the issues brought up in the book aren't exclusive to just women. After a rough childhood, Lily came to Boston and has started her own business. She meets Ryle, a neurosurgeon, and sparks fly but it doesn't appear like he wants anything more than a one-night stand. And while Lily is left wondering if there really might be potential for a relationship with the charming doctor, she also can't stop thinking about her first love, Atlas. When Atlas reappears in Lily's life, things become even more complicated for her.I somehow managed to finish the story without crying but then I go and read the Author's Note and Acknowledgements at the end and absolutely lose it. The book might be fiction but the fact so much of it is based on the author's childhood just really tugs at your heartstrings. It's also why the story comes across as so raw and authentic. I won't go into spoilers but I will say there is great potential here for something to really click with the reader and take something valuable away from the story. I highly recommend reading it. "
1755,5.0," 4,5-5 EMOTIONAL STARS ""No one is exclusively bad, nor is anyone exclusively good. Some are just forced to work harder at suppressing the bad.""This is by far the most emotional book I read so far by Colleen Hoover!!I gone blind in this story,didn't read the blurb and I didn't know what it was about.Once I start reading it , I find myself inside the story.Everything felt so real,raw,intense and emotional.""It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear."" This book was absolutely incredible and so different from the other books I have read from Colleen yet again it was original,unique and even though the story deals with very serious issues the way Colleen tells the story is so beautiful.The characters are likeable and realistic..I fell hard for them and I was anxious ,upset and nervous about how the story will end.For one more time Colleen delivers an unforgettable story like no other.This is one of these books that you must read!!!  "
1756,4.0,"I don't think I will write much about this book.Everything I could write would probably be bad and it would scare away future readers.I will say that even though it gets 4 stars (because it's Colleen Hoover and I loved most parts of it) I still hated the book. I hated huge parts of it. I think the book should not have been released as a romance book but as a self-help/autobiography kind of thing. I will say a few tiny little things as a spoiler thingy - so PLEASE DO NOT READ THEM IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK!!! (view spoiler)[ I hate love triangles. I think cutting Ryle out of the book would've made the story really great. The drama we lose with losing Ryle could've been added in some other way. But Ryle. I loved him in the beginning and I think, even though it's Colleen's right to do so, it was so totally unfair to this great person to turn him into a bad guy. Colleen says Ryle is really her dad. She wrote the book for her mom. About the life she had when Colleen was young. And comparing Ryle with her dad is so effing unfair because Ryle is not an abusive alcoholic! He's a broken boy who went through something horrific when he was six years old and with some more therapy could've led a perfectly normal life with Lily. So I think Ryle should not have been the bad guy in the book. He shouldn't have been in it at all. Lily & Atlas. That relationship had enough potential for the book. Why waste time making the reader fall in love with Ryle only to make him the bad guy later. REALLY LATER. I almost stopped reading at the 70% mark. Ugh - I could keep on writing sooo many hateful things about this story. But that's not fair, because I really loved it too. At least the Atlas/Lily/Marshall parts. But Ryle just destroyed my reading pleasure. I felt so sorry for him. And I hated him - why didn't he try more therapy - he wanted Lily back.....why not try everything possible?! I hate Lily. What she did or did not do with Atlas? Why didn't she look him up after coming to Boston?? None of that shit would've happened. Poor Ryle would be a happy doc at the Mayo Clinic and he wouldn't even know Lily. But - pfff - it's just a book. No idea why I'm so mad about it all. But I really think Colleen should not have released it as a romance. It's unfair to us readers who love simple romances. But it's also unfair to the poor people who suffer through domestic violence. End of rant. (hide spoiler)]I think most Colleen Hoover fans will love this book - love all the feels and angst and drama etc. And I loved it too. I laughed and cried A LOT....But there were just too many things wrong. Sorry. But please don't let me scare you away!! Everyone needs to decide for themselves! ♥

1757,5.0,"✿•*¨*•✿This is a magical moment...another CoHo book.✿•*¨*•✿ I need to start this review by apologizing because it’s not really going to be a review. Since I wasn’t sure how to review it without giving away too much I decided to highlight some quotes that stood out to me. ♥ “Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.”♥ “I think about how sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all that certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide.”♥ “Five minutes. That’s all it takes to completely destroy a person.”When I finished IT ENDS WITH US I unloaded my feelings on my friends and told those who haven’t read it yet TO READ IT!  For me, this book ranks up there with Hopeless as my favorite CoHo book. I recommend for the best experience to go into this book blind.

1758,4.0,"Naked Truth: I inhaled this one. It was a surprisingly hypnotic read.It started off a little soft pornish/YAish which is so not my thang. Yes, I’m anti YA and haters going to hate.This is a story of domestic abuse and the choices a woman makes.Hoover’s personal notes makes it all the more poignant.4.5 ⭐️ and I can’t wait for her new release. "
1759,4.0,"4.5 STARS.It's usually the sign of a good book when I cannot put it down! And I could not put this book down. As I have said before Ms Hoover's books can be a hit or miss for me. Some I have loved. Others not so much. I am always a bit wary when new books get 5 stars all around, especially on release day or prior to release day. The title alone intrigued me ... ... and there is one part of the book where the title makes perfect sense. Yes, I was a blubbering mess.
I love it when the sky makes me feel insignificant.I like tonight.
 I avoided most of the reviews but thought I should read the book before I saw any major spoilers. So glad I did now. Why not 5, I hear you say? I felt the ending was a bit rushed. Do NOT read the spoiler if you have not finished the book. (view spoiler)[And I honestly would never condone Ryle's actions but I felt to sad for him. I think he could have been redeemable, in one way, but, on the other hand, I am glad the author went the route she did ... (hide spoiler)]

1760,4.0,"Wow! I did not expect this book to have such an emotional impact on me! This is by far the best Colleen Hoover book I've read. She put me in Lily's shoes and made me question my thoughts and opinions and brought a light to a very important issue.This is not a light, fun read. This is a emotional, gripping and scary and very important read. I will be filming a review on it very soon."
1761,2.0,"2.5 starsI just... Wow. It's like I haven't been reading a Colleen Hoover book. Either everyone's up her ass or everyone's reading taste is completely different from mine but come on, this book was so hyped I thought it was going to be mind blowing. It was not. Oops. Listen, first of all, when I started this book I knew that something was off. I couldn't connect with the main character and her first encounter with the love interest was... weird. I seriously don't understand who would've thought that their conversation was real. It sounded like something from a R-rated TV movie for Universal. I don't know, I just had this constant uncomfortable feeling while reading about them throughout this whole novel. I feel like Colleen tried to put every serious issue into this book. It's better to focus on one aspect rather to jumble everything together. This way, nothing was completely developed and just felt flat to me. The Ellen aspect... ridiculous. I can't imagine anyone doing that. But I grew up in a different country and culture, so I'm not sure what Americans really do. (view spoiler)[Write letters in a form of diaries to famous people? Really? OH... And she named her daughter Emerson Dory. Kill me. NOW. (hide spoiler)]And there comes the FINAL moment of the story. When everything goes batshit crazy. Including me because I just kept waiting for the final straw that would make me close the book forever. (view spoiler)[ She included so many issues like abuse, rape, infertility, family issues on both sides, homelessness that I honestly prayed to God that she wouldn't add a miscarriage. That just screams Colleen Hoover. (hide spoiler)]Also, everything felt anticlimactic. The whole book was just getting worse and worse. And I thought it couldn't get worse than that beginning. I was wrong my friends. The ending was even worse. You know what would've been nice? (view spoiler)[ If authors stopped pushing characters into relationships. Did she really had to be with Atlas in the end? Like, couldn't she have chilled out with her baby for a year, worked in her shop, had some fun with Alyssa... just chilled the fuck out? (hide spoiler)]AND THE NAMES. OH MY GOD.  And, you know what else kind of saddened me? I haven't marked ONE SINGLE QUOTE. The writing was off as well. I felt like I was reading an extended script rather than a novel. Bummer.I only have Slammed left to read and after that, I say adios to CoHo.****Before reading this:  I want to marry this cover. "
1762,5.0,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐I started reading this only this morning and have just finished reading the last page five hours later. I could not put this down. I was so emotionally invested in this story from the very first page. I have been putting off reading Colleen Hoover for a very long time due to fear of disappointment but it's safe to say I'm so glad I finally got around to reading this one.Do check trigger warnings if you are going to read this one though!
1763,1.0,"Naked truth?I'm just part of the minority that didn't like It Ends With Us and I'm okay with that. You guys may have loved this, but honestly? I just didn't feel like I was reading a Colleen Hoover novel. The writing didn't read the same, there was massive disconnections with the characters and the story was a little sloppy, all over the place and slightly problematic. I felt like Colleen wrote different chapters at different times and just put them together in hopes of it working. One part of the book I did enjoy was the Letters to Ellen. In fact those were my very favourite parts of this book as they offered some detail behind the context that was Lily's life. It was a shame I just didn't like her character and personality at all, but I applaud Colleen for giving us a different take on relationships."
1764,3.0,My naked truth for IT ENDS WITH US is that I wish I wouldn't of read it because I do feel bad for not liking a story with such an emotional and important subject like domestic violence and a strong character like Lily more than I did. I wished I had enjoyed it more. Unfortunately for me the romance and some scenes in the story were not enjoyable to me and I couldn't connect with the seriousness of this story. The ending didn't work for me as I would have liked more focus put on an important part of the story and I was left feeling that something was missing
1765,5.0,"4,5 ★Puta que pariu, caralho, porra, demônioEu não consigo falar desse livro sem ficar DESGRAÇADA da cabeça, porque ele simplesmente conversou comigo e me tocou de uma forma muito desesperadora. Não consigo formular resenha escrita.Só leiam. Leiam muito."
1766,5.0,"Ms. Colleen Hoover is very well known for her creative love stories that are sometimes cheesy, often a bit smutty but usually beautiful and inspiring. But what makes her stand out as a writer for me is her ability to make readers see through the wide spectrum of shades that begins with white and ends with black. Like what she did with Maybe Someday, in this book she once again allows the reader to see that a person is made of complex qualities- that no person is purely good or bad and that there are a hundred possible reasons behind every action and therefore one cannot be judged by the action he/she does. She makes me realize that not all stories require a villain. Just because somebody does bad things doesn’t make them the anti-hero.But in the end, it’s always up to the person how much bad he or she allows in his/her life. A strong person despite her/his dark past and negative experiences knows when to walk away or stay and contrary to popular belief that love is enough, in some cases IT.JUST.ISN’T and therefore It Ends With Us isn’t just a love story. It’s an eye-opener, a gentle way of reminding us of a very rampant social issue/problem but which is commonly neglected or misunderstood and I thank the author for her courage in writing her most significant novel as to date while drawing from her personal experiences. I have fallen in love with CoHo’s stories, her writing and creativity but after this book, I am in love with her as a person. ‘nuff said. JUST KEEP SWIMMING!  :')"
1767,5.0,This book is everything.Easily one of my top 10 books of all-time.A MUST read.
1768,5.0,It's been a long time since I had those feelings over a book... Epic!
1769,5.0,"""It Ends with Us"" by Colleen Hoover is a very emotional, tug-of-war read!Taking a much needed evening respite on a neighboring Boston rooftop after a terrible, awful, very bad day, Lily Bloom meets handsome-dressed-in-hospital-scrubs-neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid. Both recognize an immediate attraction and a playfully honest Q&A session begins! She tells him she dreams of opening a flower shop. He tells her he has a 'no dating rule' but desires one night of hot sex with her. Lily is intrigued but declines.... They meet six months later when Lily has just hired Ryle's sister Allysa as the first employee in her soon to open flower shop. The attraction is still evident between Lily and Ryle. There is an exception made to Ryle's 'no dating rule' and a loving relationship begins.A year into their relationship, Lily and Ryle have dinner with Lily's mother at a new restaurant and Lily does a mouth-open-double-take! Their waiter is her hometown boyfriend, Atlas Corrigan! Her first love. Her forever love, or so she thought! He's in Boston? She's shocked! She's stunned! Alas is here? She would never have started a new relationship if...... There's a dual timeline created by Lily reading her diary from her high school years. This is when the history of her relationship with Atlas is brought to life. How it begins and how it ends with a promise from Atlas that he will come back for her.This is a book where the author is at her best weaving a story together before our eyes! It moves along so sweetly and then BOOM! An unexpected twist and the story takes a turn. I didn't want to hear it and yet I continued to devour this book. Not all pieces of this story were pretty, some parts were downright tough to hear. But, when all the pieces and parts connected I understood the importance of Lily's complete journey. The audiobook narrated by Olivia Song was an amazing experience! She did an excellent job as the voice of Lily in the first person POV. Her voicing for the other characters was done with the appropriate inflections for believability that continued to bring this book to life. The author's words at the end is a poignant note. I love this author for her writing style. She not only writes beautifully but I discover she is bold and unafraid. So now I love her for her authenticity and transparency! I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy CoHo at her finest! 4.5 stars rounded to 5 stars!  "

I did get a little emotional at certain points. but I wasn't blown away. i was SO curious about it, cause almost all my friends on goodreads gave it a 5 stars so i said to myself, Why not try one more Coho's book (i read hopeless and it was so awful i couldn't even finish it) Awnway, watch out for spoilers if you haven't read the book yet it Ends with us tells a story of one girl Lily bloom from childhood through adluthood, What she has been through, and what made her into the woman she is today. i really loved her at first, Young Lily was my favorite character. despite everything she was still innocent and sweet. and i loved her even more when she helped Atlas. Their relationship was strong their connection was deep. till they went separate ways because of her father. her dad was an asshole who abused her mother when he got drunk. Lily went to college just to run away from the hell she was living with her family, she grew up to be this smart, stron,g hard working, loving person. And THEN she met Ryle and fell in love with him. Ryle is the kind of guy who hates commitment and relationships and doesn't want children, He was bad news (i kept singing i knew you were trouble by taylor swift, God i knew this wasn't going to end well) Anyway, he was charming and he swept her off her feet by being the sexy neurosergent.  ""He spins around and kicks one of the pation chairs behind him....the guys doesn't stop with just one kick, he kicks the chair repeatedly, over and over."" First Red flag!!  ""i'm supposed to be the woman my mother was never strong enough to be"" Damn right! ""Be that girl, Brave and bold"" ""you aren't a bad person, Ryle. i know that. you can still protect me. when you're upsset, just walk away.and i'll walk away, we'll leave the situation until you're calm enough to talk about it, okay? you are not a monster, Ryle.""   He tried to hurt you more than once and he pushed you off the stairs, and he almost raped you and you're still thinking about forgiving him? Bitch, i hope he pushs you off a cliff next time, Maybe then, Just maybe, you'll wake up from your delusional fairy tale."
1773,4.0,"I get now why in the blurb this was called a ""bold"" work from Colleen Hoover. I think this is her most provocative work to date. It really made me pause and think, then think again a lot of times while I was reading. Bravo for Colleen for pulling off telling this story, and the issue involved, in such a delicate but honest and raw way. "
1774,5.0,*adds all of Colleen Hoover’s books to my tbr*
1775,3.0,"Actual Rating: 3.5 Stars""For better? For worse? Fuck. That. Shit.""You know what? I am pleasantly surprised to say that I actually enjoyed this book.I was a little nervous going into it, as New Adult/Contemporary isn't really my scene. This book is an exception. It Ends with Us has some very important things to say about manipulation, love, and abuse. However, it is NOT clear from the synopsis what kind of book this will be. It's marketed as a Romance, but I'm hear to tell you 
THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT ABUSE.
The story is very well written. As someone who has been through an emotionally abusive relationship, I felt the portrayals of abuser/victim were on point.Hoover does well making Lily an extremely approachable main character. She's hardworking & ambitious, but also insecure & unresolved about growing up witnessing an abusive relationship between her mother & father. When Ryle Kincaid enters her life, Lily is swept up into a situation that seems too good to be true. And suddenly it is.Have I ever had a gorgeous neurosurgeon sweep me off my feet? No, I haven't. But I have experienced the horrifying shift from perfect relationship to terrible relationship.It happens over time, and it happens all at once.You always have an explanation for the bad times, and you hyper-fixate on the good times in an effort to erase the bad. There is always something you could've done to prevent the mistreatment. You find the smallest, most convoluted ways to differentiate your situation from all the other abusive scenarios out there. You keep drawing lines in the sand for when you'll leave, and when they inevitably cross that line you just draw a new one.Excuse. Defend. Justify.It is amazing the mental gymnastics you'll put yourself through in order to make everything seem alright when it isn't.I appreciate how honestly these coping mechanisms were portrayed in the story. It was easy to see myself in Lily.I respect that this book does not romanticize or pardon abuse. We are not meant to root for the abuser, we are meant to root for Lily.I docked a couple stars from my rating because there were a few small scale aspects I didn't love. The names. The names in this book are so ridiculous. Lily Blossom Bloom? Ryle? Atlas? Do people name their children like this in real life?Some unrealistic circumstances took me out of the story a bit. There was also a small savior arc that I couldn't really support. Overall though this is a book with a powerful message & an insightful look at how overwhelming it can be to find the courage to love yourself enough to walk away from situations that no longer serve you. Abuse can happen to anyone, and each situation is different. It's easy to think you'd never allow yourself to be caught up in an abusive relationship until you do.Buddy read this with my sweet Kainat!"
1776,5.0,"This book was my introduction into Colleen Hoover's work, and I can tell you I was absolutely blown away! First of all, my attention was caught right from the start by the intriguing characters that were introduced. From there, my emotions became involved to the point where nothing else mattered to me but to continue reading, and living in the world that Ms. Hoover created. I was highlighting like crazy all of the important messages that were scattered through out this story. This will most definitely not be the last time I read her books. I have found me a new author that I can investigate all of her back list, and do it happily!""It Ends With Us"" is a book that you want to go in blind. Do not read spoilers as I felt that my curiosity and intrigue was more heightened when I didn't know what was expected. I will say this though, this story hit very close to home with me. It was not the easiest read for me, and it taught me to look at a subject that I use to look at very differently. I now have had to re-look at my perception of that subject with fresh eyes, and I am so glad that I have so much more understanding now after reading about Lily. I also have a new found respect for one of my family members and what they have experienced in their life. I know it is cryptic, but I really don't want to post spoilers. Just trust me when I say that if you are looking for an emotional book, that will give you a new outlook on life...this is the book for you. An absolute wonderful story, and one that I won't ever forget. This is going down as one of my top faves of 2016!Thanks Steph for the Buddy read and for bringing this book to my attention! I loved chatting with you through this one!♥"

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestThere are two camps when it comes to Colleen Hoover's books: Team CoHo and Team WTH (why the hype?). Until very recently, I was solidly Team WTH. I'd read HOPELESS, the book that made Hoover a big-name hit, and was horrified by how bad I found it. I also tried reading one of her more recent works, NOVEMBER 9, and was so disgusted by both characters that I ended up slogging miserably through all 310 pages of it.You're probably asking yourself, ""If you hate her books so much, why read them?"" The answer is that I like to give authors multiple chances before giving up on them completely. Some are just lost causes for me: for whatever reason, their plots and writing styles are totally incompatible with my preferences. But Hoover had versatility going with her. Yes, I hated both books that I read, but for different reasons: they were both written very differently, about different subjects, with very different writing styles.My hope was that, eventually, Hoover would write a book that would work for me.Ironically, the first book of hers that I ever liked was totally free to read. Hoover published TOO LATE on Wattpad for readers to enjoy without paying a dime. Skeptically, I began reading the book, fully expecting the worst. Instead, I found myself hopping aboard a speeding train filled with drama, abuse, angst, sex, drugs, and violence. Normally, I take what her hardcore fans say with a grain of salt, but this time, they were 100% correct: this book wasn't like anything she had ever written before. It was dark, unpleasant, gritty. The Queen of Fluff had decided to don studs and a mohawk.When her fans then began saying that IT ENDS WITH US was the same - also dark, also unpleasant, and also completely unlike anything she'd ever written - I decided to trust their opinion, and once more, they were totally correct. It's difficult to explain what IT ENDS WITH US is about without delving into spoilers territory, but abuse is a prominent theme. It was a theme in some of her other books, too, but here, I felt that Hoover really went out of her way to deal with it as realistically and sensitively as possible. If you're interested enough to read the afterward, you'll find out why.The best comparison I can think of is to imagine that a character in one of Sarah Dessen's books grew up and then decided to narrate the dramatic experiences in her early twenties. Like all other CoHo protagonists, Lily Bloom has unconventional quirks and an irritating name, but it's seriously downplayed. Likewise, the slut-shaming is completely absent. Lily's friendship with Allysa and Lucy is decent and healthy. Her relationships are a bit more complicated for reasons that are difficult to explain, but I wasn't really happy with either love interest, not even the one I was supposed to be.The negative reviews I looked at complained that this book relies on emotional manipulation to get the point across, and while I didn't take issue with that as much as they did, I totally get what they mean. On a scale of one to Jodi Picoult, this book scores Jodi Picoult. But I was so pleased by the strength of the writing and the satisfying ending that I was able to ignore my qualms. I did have qualms, though, and that's the reason this book is getting three stars from me, as opposed to four or five. I just wasn't invested enough in Lily to feel the feelings that made everyone feel. I did sympathize with her though, and I thought the author's note at the end was really powerful.This is a solid addition to Colleen Hoover's repertoire. There are now two Colleen Hoover books that I did not hate. I'm slowly stepping out of Team WTH, and finding that, while the grass may not be quite as green on the other side of the camp, there are some very lovely flowers scattered throughout here and there for those who care to enjoy them.3 stars."
1780,5.0,"I LOVE THIS BOOK WITH MY WHOLE HEART. 5/5 hands down my favorite book now. I was hooked in right from the beginning, and never wanted to put it down (hence why I finished it within less than 24 hours). Colleen has such a way with her words. She made me fall in love with the characters and the story so fast, and I found myself crying throughout the book because she wrote this so perfectly.I recommend this 100% to anyone and everyone. The morals of this book are so good and so important to bring attention to. Again, I love this book with my whole heart and can’t wait to re-read it and also watch the movie!!!"

There is no such thing as bad people. We're all just people who sometimes do bad things.
It Ends With Us is a devastating, evocative story of forgiveness, empathy, understanding, and impossible choices. I had to set this book down and step away from it more than once, I had to take moments to cry and feel and breathe. I had a visceral reaction to every page, a physical ache to forgive the unforgivable, emotional  distress over witnessing such devastation, grief over all that is lost. Friendships are born and broken in these pages, lives are saved and destroyed, lessons are learned, souls are crushed, hope is restored and dashed, the people you least expect to hurt you do, the people you least expect to save you will. I felt the raw intensity of falling in love, of falling apart, every note of humor and joy and despair so acutely. I felt this book in a way I know I will never forget.
Maybe love isn't something that comes full circle. It just ebbs and flows, in and out, just like the people in our lives.
Ryle Kincaid, Lily's present day love interest and successful neurosurgeon, is arrogant and sexy and driven and I fell for him instantly. Atlas Corrigan, the kind, affectionate teenager from her past, is beautifully broken and I loved him immediately and intensely. It was difficult to fathom a future for 24 year old florist, Lily Bloom, that didn't include both of these men who were so dear to her at varying points in her life, and my heart hurt knowing we couldn't have them both. Colleen Hoover vividly and humorously juxtaposes the past with the present, threading the heaviness of Lily's youth with the lightness and humor of her diaries to make for an emotional storyline peppered with both devastation and wit. When the two parts of her life converge, the boy from her past who had nothing and the man from her present who has it all, Lily must decide what it all means for her future.
If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.
Going in, I believed this was merely a romance about a woman who'd have to make a choice between the two men she'd loved after their paths unexpectedly collided, but I soon realized that It Ends With Us is so much more than I could have ever predicted. This story shattered me. I loved every character thoroughly, connected with them in different but equal ways, and that's why the events in this book are so inconceivable. There was no predicting the course of events that would occur within these pages. Things happened in this story that I never saw coming, couldn't believe were actually happening and everything I thought I knew, thought I believed in, became uncertain. To experience Lily's journey properly, the reader has to first be made to love these characters the way she does, then be blindsided by their unthinkable behavior as she is, and then experience the heartbreaking decisions she's forced to make right along with her... and Hoover deliberately and exquisitely ensures we do just that .
I think about Ryle. I think about Atlas. I think about how sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all that certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide.
I'll tell you now that this story is not what you think it is. It's different. It's bigger. It's more. It's romantic, no doubt about that. The undeniable chemistry between Lily and Ryle wars with the passionate history between Lily and Atlas to make for an emotional, tumultuous journey of love and heartbreak. But this story is something else entirely. It's a story of familial drama, of friendship, of healing and rebuilding and finding peace with things that can't be changed. It's about experiencing the best and the worst in people and deciding what's worth the risk. It's a love story... two actually... but to simply call this book a romance significantly dims the brilliance that is It Ends With Us. Colleen Hoover fans like myself will find everything they love about this author within these pages. But readers should set their expectations and preconceived notions aside because, while this story is signature CoHo, it far exceeds anything we've ever seen from her before. Hoover steps outside the box in the very best ways with It Ends With Us, but this isn't just her toeing the line. This is Colleen Hoover making a new box, a bigger box, an extensive, impressive, more polished box. Colleen Hoover just took the old box, the one with Slammed and Maybe Someday and November 9 and Hopeless in it, blew the lid off it, dumped it all inside a huge new box, so all our favorite signature COHO stuff is still in there (the humor, the smart dialogue, the enigmatic characters, the captivating storyline, the heavy themes, the raw emotions.) But now it's a much larger box with a whole lot more stuff in it. New stuff. Beautiful stuff. Powerful stuff. Stuff we've never seen. Things we didn't expect. This new box is glorious and ugly and fantastic. It's a box of CoHo taking chances. It's a box of CoHo getting unbelievably personal while broadening horizons all at once. It Ends With Us is an exciting, fresh box filled with the old classic CoHo and a bunch of other awesome and beautiful things that can't even be named. This new box just blew my mind. 
In the future... if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again... fall in love with me.
This is, hands down, the best book Colleen Hoover has ever written. Is it my favorite? I don't know how to answer that. It feels wrong to describe the course of events in this book as my 'favorite' anything. It feels wrong to call a book I wish had never been written 'phenomenal.' But I'll call it that because that's what it is. It's the most powerful, beautiful, haunting story this author has ever delivered. It's also one of the most profoundly important books I've ever read. I was deeply effected by this story. I felt everything this author set out to make her reader feel while reading this book. The love, the hope, the devastation, the grief, the fear, the sadness, the loss, the conflicting emotions, all of it. I got it. I was so far in this story, in these characters, on this journey, I don't know how long it'll take me to find my way out. This is not a feel good story. This isn't heartwarming. This is tragic. And it's perfect. Every single detail, every brick in the wall of the structure of this story, was meticulously placed by this author and it was done so magnificently. I don't know if it's my favorite because this story made me feel things I don't ever want to feel again, but the fact that she made me feel THAT WAY means this story was executed perfectly, that it is, under no uncertain terms, phenomenal. "
1782,5.0,"I've loved every book Colleen Hoover has ever written, but I did not expect IT ENDS WITH US to hit me in such a profound way. There's a line in this novel that goes like this, ""There's no such thing as bad people. We're all just people who sometimes do bad things."" It was a line that resonated with me and a line that sums up the message in this book perfectly....You'll fall in love with characters, you'll feel frustrated with characters. You'll feel like some actions are unforgivable, while also hoping somehow it will all magically work out. You'll wish you could rip out certain pages and pretend they didn't happen. I've never been so conflicted while reading a book but this novel reminded me once again that not every story―fictional or not―is black and white. If you want a book that is going to make you feel, you shouldn't hesitate to pick up IT ENDS WITH US. It's not only one of my favourite books of the year, it also has one of my favourite titles ever....the last few lines before the epilogue gave the title a whole new layer of meaning that I never anticipated. Thank-you Colleen Hoover for yet another beautiful story...Lily's is going to stick with me for a while."
1783,5.0,"Honestly, this is probably the best book CoHo has ever written. I wasn't even going to pick it up because I had some problems with her last few books, but I am so glad I did. "
1784,3.0,"We can start by saying that this book is no fairytale for sure. I started reading it expecting another cliche but it was not. This book was different and i liked that about it. Reviewing without any possible spoiler is pretty hard since reading CoHo's books without knowing anything about them before is always the best.  My first experiences with CoHo were the best, i don't know if being a newly active reader was the reason or her new captivating stories and writing style but i was surely hooked. Yet, tastes change with time. Even though Slammed and Hopeless are still 5 stars for me, I couldn't get into Ugly love, maybe someday and Nov 9. I can say i have read all of her books but not novellas, and this book was surely different, in a good way . It had a messageStory starts with Lily, a girl in her twenties who moved to Boston to follow her dreams. She graduated from college and now working for a decent company. However, life wasn't always easy on her. And she swore to never repeat her mother's mistakes. She meets Ryle the charming neurosurgeon who is anti-relationship, yet he feels more than attraction toward Lily. As they grow closer, an unforgettable person from her teenage days reappears but Lily knows what her heart wants.  Now, major spoilers ahead, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Growing up in an abusive family she surely felt hatred toward her father. Atlas, the homeless boy next door, was her great support but she was his savior. Yet, life was hard and they drifted apart. Surely Lily and Ryle would like each other. Surely he would be prince charming, great looks, money, funny, smart until we discover he has a temper. A really bad temper. First thing i want to say to Lily, stop crying for God's sake. She cries at least twice in each chapter! Get a grip on your feelings girl! I can't say she didn't stand up for herself because she did. Still, i didn't feel connected to the characters that much. This book has two of the little things i absolutely hate in a book. 1)Insta-love. They chatted for what? 2 hours? She told her life secrets to a stranger so easily and was almost ready to sleep with him on the rooftop? OK, she said no sex but make out? Seriously?! 2) Love triangles. Fine, i let that pass, i understand, it's one of the rare occasions where i try to understand yet, yet it's annoying nonetheless. A part of her will always love Atlas, true. He was always the only one for her.Before you marry someone you're supposed to tell him about your past, after all, you'll spend all your life with him, it's not right to hide anything, not fair, maybe not intentionally hide but it still is keeping secrets that will haunt you later. OF COURSE, HE HAD NO RIGHT. What i'm saying is that both of them should have opened up more about their past before taking any life changing decisions. this one is more than major: (view spoiler)[ I personally know someone who shot his younger brother accidently while using a gun when they both were no older than 12. He became a wonderful modest person, it's not like he was bad or something but he's is now a greater person, no abuse no violence, the most peaceful person you can meet. I believe he is trying to make up for what he did but well, i just liked to point out that it doesn't necessarily ruin you, i know he hasn't healed on the inside but he's living with this scar and handling it more than well. As much society influences our characters, people become what they choose to be, but then again everyone handles the same situation in his own way which was violence for Ryle. (hide spoiler)]I liked the idea of the book and moral of it, i just had my ups and downs. It is a page turner. It's not a light read, for sure. The ending was satisfying for me, the best thing about it even. It was really good to read from the perspective of someone who was abused, her feelings, her thoughts, what she went through and how she acted. Well, Love is blind but it needs limits, but unfortunately, not all the human population realizes this."
1785,5.0,"Genre: Contemporary RomanceType: StandalonePOV: First Person - FemaleRating: Ryle Kincaid was a highly successful and ambitious neurosurgeon. He dedicated his time to his career and never interested in a committed relationship. That was until someone came into his life and shattered his walls.Lily Bloom was not afraid to take risks to make her lifelong dream come true. When she met Ryle, life couldn't be more perfect. But when Atlas Corrigan came back from the past, it reminded her of something she should never forget - sometimes, there's some things not worth the risk. This book comes with a lot of hype way before the release. I keep seeing words like ""heartbreaking"" and ""life changing"" but I never knew what the story is about until I read it (which is the best way to read this book). And yes, now I understand why the reactions.
 “I feel like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down we’re all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others.”
I admired Ryle's drive and ambition. But at the same time, I also love seeing him bending when it came to Lily and how he changed everything he believed before her.
 I think about how sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all that certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide.
Lily was also an admirable character. It required a lot of strength to be in her situation.But my favorite character since the beginning is Atlas. The moment he was introduced in the book, I knew I would love him.
 “There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”
As for the story I do not want to say anything, but I'd like to address the subject - the situation and the dilemma the characters were in. Like a lot of things in life, it is never just black and white. It is very easy to judge when you are not the one wearing the shoes.
 All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.
I do not have personal experience with such issue, but I've seen it happened to people I know. And yes, on first impression I myself made judgement. But then I also realized I knew nothing about what happened behind the curtains. It most likely won't justify it, but we all should at least acknowledge it that there are reasons for why certain things happened.It Ends With Us is a story of people in difficult situation and how they found strength to survive it. It is raw, real, and something many people would be able to relate to.Note:This book was not that sad for me until the ""breaking the pattern"" scene. That one shattered my cold dark heart :( lol!✦ ☘ ✦ . . . (F)BR With Loyda . . .✦ ☘ ✦For more reviews/reveals/giveaways visit:

“I feel like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down we’re all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others.”
I don’t even know where to start with this review. A day after I finished and I just can’t stop thinking about this book. It was just so powerful. Colleen Hoover is definitely a favorite of the Sisterhood, so when Atria generously sent us the ARC for It Ends With Us, we couldn’t contain our excitement, we really, really wanted to read it. This book has a theme about “naked truths”, when is naked truth time, you have to be brutally honest. My naked truth is that even though I love Colleen Hoover, I have not loved every Colleen Hoover I’ve read. However, there is no denying that even though I haven’t loved some of her previous books (well, mostly Ugly Love), her writing is incredible, and no two of her books are the same. With each book, she surprises me more and more. Her popularity is not due to overhype, she’s truly the real deal.
“Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.”
So what is It Ends With Us about? I wish I could tell you, but I can’t. And trust me you would thank me for it later. This is truly one of those books you have to go in blind in order to truly appreciate the development of the story and all of the twist and turns. I feel like everything I say about it could spoil your reading experience and I do not want that. I will say that this is definitely not a love triangle regardless of the blurb. The best way I can describe it is to say that this is plain and simple Lily’s journey. She’s the main character, she’s the center of this story and everyone else to me was secondary. I loved brave and bold Lily so much. I laughed with her and I cried with her. But above all I tried to put myself in her shoes many times while I read this story. I tried to understand what she was going through and tried to understand why she made the decisions she made.
“We’d just been two people who helped each other when we needed it and got our hearts fused together along the way.”
While reading this book I went through all sorts of emotions. I laughed, I cried, I got sad, I got angry. By the time I finished I was emotionally wrecked. I was happy and heartbroken at the same time. This book is really heavy, it deals with heavy subjects but it’s so well done and so necessary. This book is just so much more; it’s so personal and so raw. I feel like everything in this book is so well crafted, everything has a place, everything has a purpose. Even if this is not necessarily a feel good story, this book was perfect, in every way.
“In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.”
This book is now definitely at the top of my favorite books ever. Definitely one of my Top Favorites of 2016. Is it my favorite Colleen Hoover book? I’m not sure. My heart was so heavy reading this. Plus, November 9 was also amazing. Is it her most personal book? For sure, just read her author’s note and you will understand why (AFTER you read the book). Do I recommend this book? Absolutely and without a doubt. I think EVERYONE should read this, EVERYONE. And we should discuss this more. So, go pick up a copy of It Ends With Us, I promise you’re in for a powerful ride, this will change you forever.
“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”

1787,4.0,"Wow, what a book!!! I usually stay far away from this author's books. Not that her books aren't excellently written, it's more about keeping my sanity and my heart in one piece. If I had known how I felt after reading this book, I might have never picked it up in the first place because this book messed with my head and heart. I hate that the author made me care about all the characters, including one specific one, and then just pulled the plug. It was like getting the rug pulled out from underneath me. My head and heart had a hard time catching up with everything that was going on.I was this close to throwing my kindle out the window. I couldn't believe what I was reading. Everything I thought about this story was suddenly turned upside down.But after some time, and when I was thinking rationally again, I realized how much skill went into this book. It Ends With Us was one of the best example of what a master storyteller can do with a great plot. I was floored by how brilliant it all was.I can honestly say that this book will stay with me for a long time. "

It Ends With Us nos cuenta la historia de Lily, una chica que ha tenido una vida difícil en medio de problemas familiares y que decide mudarse a Boston justo después de la muerte de su abusivo padre. Allí, una noche en una azotea, Lily conoce a Ryle Kincaid, un neurocirujano guapísimo y algo hace click entre ellos. Sin embargo, su historia no empieza inmediatamente, pues Ryle no quiere una relación seria y Lily no va a aceptar algo así. De esa manera pasa mucho tiempo hasta que vuelven a encontrarse nuevamente y el magnetismo que hay entre ellos ya hace inevitable que sus caminos queden unidos. Al mismo tiempo que vivimos la historia entre Kyle y Lily, ella va leyendo periódicamente un diario que escribió cuando era pequeña y en el que iba narrando cómo conoció a su primer gran amor, Atlas. Él era un chico que había huido de su casa y se estaba quedando en una abandonada que quedaba justo al lado de donde Lily vivía. Así, en ese momento, se volvieron amigos y mucho más.Como les decía antes, It Ends With Us es un libro duro de leer porque, desde el momento en el que conocemos a Lily, notamos que ella odia de alguna manera a su madre por haber aguantado tantos abusos de su padre durante tantísimo tiempo, por no haberlo dejado después de la primera agresión. Y, así mismo, Lily siempre se prometió a sí misma nunca quedarse dentro de una relación abusiva... pero las circunstancias de su vida la llevaron precisamente a una. Por otra parte, leerlo es duro también por la historia paralela del pasado que nos va contando. Allí está con Atlas y todo es tan dulce y complicado a la vez. De hecho, si me lo preguntan, mis partes favoritas del libro eran estas cartas en las que Lily recordaba todo lo que vivió con Atlas, cómo se fue enamorando de él y esa última promesa que se hicieron antes de separarse. Mientras avanzaba en la historia de Ryle y Lily, empecé a pensar que todo era demasiado perfecto y, claro, cuando llegaban los capítulos de Atlas, quería que él volviera de alguna manera a la vida de Lily porque Ryle me daba mala espina. ¡Y tenía razón! De hecho, creo que una de las cosas que me molestaron un montón del libro es la excusa o explicación que le dieron al comportamiento de Ryle en ciertas circunstancias. Como ""ay, hizo esto, pero pobrecillo, es que no se controla"". ¡Por favor! Y me daba muchísima rabia que Lily, siendo la chica que nos presentaron al principio siguiera atrapada en la relación de la que toda su vida quiso escapar. ¿Por qué le pongo, entonces, 4.5 estrellas al libro si me molestaron muchísimas cosas? Porque Colleen Hoover plasmó en las páginas de It Ends With Us una situación real, una situación que viven muchísimas personas y que es muy fácil juzgar desde fuera. Si bien Lily se ve arrastrada por las circunstancias y por sus propios sentimientos, llega el momento en el que logra salir de un círculo vicioso, logra romper un patrón y tomar la decisión más difícil y sana de toda su vida. Y no digo que todo haya sido malo y que los personajes sean monstruos. Por el contrario, son personajes reales y no idealizados. Son personajes que cometen errores, que se quedan atrapados en medio de sentimientos muy intensos y que tienen decisiones que tomar. Cada uno de ellos, Lily, Ryle, Atlas... todos son humanos y actúan guiados por sus sentimientos, por el querer protegerse a sí mismos y a los demás. It Ends With Us es una historia dura sobre todo si en algún momento te enamoras de Ryle. Ahí es cuando vas a entrar en conflicto contigo misma por todo lo que sucede allí. Aquí, afortunadamente, me salvé un poco porque siempre me gustó más Atlas que Ryle, jajajaja. "
1790,1.0,No idea how this ended up on my kindle. 30% in and can't take anymore. The least said the better I think............... 
1791,5.0,"Re-read: October 2017Getting in CoHo mode awaiting her new release!Original Review: August 2016Please note: The following review discusses the theme of It Ends with Us but no detailed spoilers are included. However, if you would like to go into your reading experience completely blind, then I recommend you wait until you finish the book to read this review.★★★★½When my son was a toddler, we had an at-home accident involving him running, slipping on the tile, and his toothbrush going into my eye. He was OK but I on the other hand wound up alone at a local urgent care with a swollen and bloody eye. After being treated, I left with some prescriptions, aftercare instructions, a referral for counseling, and a stack of domestic violence resources. My injury was not the result of abuse and I told the provider that. Maybe she didn’t believe me or maybe it was just routine protocol, regardless I didn’t make a fuss. I smiled, took the information, and thanked her for her concern. Why? Because I am very certain she has heard every excuse under the sun and the resistance must be exhausting. Why would I contribute to that? Why give a helping hand any cause to hesitate next time? Because “next time” may very well present a true victim finally ready to take action. Here’s hoping anyways.It Ends With Us is a fictional story based on very nonfiction people and events. Despite my initial thoughts while reading, Ms. Hoover’s purpose was not to smile, nod, and say OK to victims who give violent partners yet another chance, but to offer perspective on why some may struggle with the choice to act. Despite the many factors that likely encourage some relationships to continue in the midst of violence, both giving and receiving abuse are often learned behaviors that take an enormous amount of effort to unlearn. 

“Cyles exist because they are excruciating to break. It takes an astronomical amount of pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern. Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiar circles, rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet.”

 As Ms. Hoover stresses more than once in this novel, the question should not always be why is the victim staying, but rather why is the perpetrator abusing. But if an abuser does not recognize his or her problem and actively participate in help, there’s absolutely no room for heroes. Strength isn’t staying, strength is stopping by moving on. This book is both happy and sad, it's funny, sexy, suspenseful, scary, honest, but also miraculously hopeful. Most importantly though, it gently coaxes readers into non-judgement mode. Perspective does that. It changes people. It changes the self-righteous as well as the downtrodden who may need that little bit of motivation to make a choice. Read this book!My favorite quote:""I think of all the people who have been in this situation before me. Everyone who will be in this situation after me. Do we all repeat the same words in our heads in the days after experiencing abuse at the hands of those who love us? 'From this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health, until death do us part.' Maybe those vows weren't meant to be taken as literally as some spouses take them.For better, for worse?Fuck.That.Shit.""Note: Colleen Hoover ends It Ends with Us with the following resources: ""If you are a victim of domestic violence or know someone who could use assistance in leaving a dangerous situation, please visit: www.thehotline.org. For a list of resources for homeless individuals, please visit: www.homelessresourcenetwork.org."""
1792,5.0,"Everyone loves a great love story.This book gives you TWO of them.💗WINNER - 2016 Goodreads Choice Awards for Best RomanceColleen Hoover is the expert at perfectly describing the glorious feelings of falling in love. On the flip side, she also tackles the sensitive subject of domestic violence with all the dynamics involved.... how it can subtly creep in, be masked to look like something else, and can so easily be passed down from generation to generation. I absolutely loved this story. After reading it, I learned it was partially based on events from the author's own life, which made it even more powerful.This is an important book which covers the emotional gamut with a superb ending. I think it's a must-read for everyone."
1793,4.0,"It Ends with Us, Colleen HooverLily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She's come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up - she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily's life suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, and maybe even a little arrogant. He's also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily, but Ryle's complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan – her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened. With this bold and deeply personal novel, Colleen Hoover delivers a heart-wrenching story that breaks exciting new ground for her as a writer. It Ends With Us is an unforgettable tale of love that comes at the ultimate price.عنوانها: «ما تمامش می‌کنیم»؛ «و کسی نماند جز ما»؛ «با ما تمام می‌شود»؛ نویسنده: کالین هوور؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش روز هجدهم ماه دسامبر سال 2017میلادیعنوان: ما تمامش می‌کنیم؛ نویسنده: کالین هوور؛ مترجم: آرتمیس مسعودی؛ تهران: آموت‏‫ چاپ اول تا هشتم٬ 1396؛ در 380ص؛ شابک 978600384030؛ چاپ نهم تا شانزدهم 1397؛ موضوع: داستانهای نویسندگان ایالات متحده آمریکا - سده 21م‬عنوان: و کسی نماند جز ما؛ نویسنده: كالين هوور؛ مترجم: ساناز کریمی؛ تهران انتشارات میلکان، چاپ اول تا هفتم؛ ‏‫‏‏‏1396؛ در 324ص؛ شابک 9786007845912؛عنوان: با ما تمام می‌شود؛ نویسنده: کلین هوور؛ ‏‫مترجمها: سیدعلی الیاسی، فهمیمه مسرور؛ تهران اندیشمندان کسرا، ‏‫1396؛ در 370ص؛ شابک 9786008811299؛عنوان: ما تمامش می‌کنیم؛ نویسنده: کالین هوور؛ مترجم: مریم فیاض‌بخش؛ تهران نیک فرجام‏‫، 1397؛ در 368ص؛ شابک 9786007159903؛‬عنوان: ما تمامش می‌کنیم؛ نویسنده: کالین هوور؛ مترجم: محمدجواد شجاعی؛ مشهد انتشارات پرثوآ‏‫‬، 1397؛ در 376ص؛ شابک 9786229512401؛عنوان: ما تمامش می‌کنیم؛ نویسنده: کالین هوور؛ مترجم: فرشته افسری؛ تهران آسو‏‫‬، 1398؛ در 248ص؛ شابک 9786226744010؛نقل از متن: «گاهی اوقات کسیکه دوستتان دارد، بیشتر از دیگران آزارتان می‌دهد؛ من خیلی به مرگ فکر می‌کنم؛ به‌ ویژه، امروز که تازه ــ همین دوازده ساعت پیش ــ جانانه ‌ترین سخنرانی تمجید، در مراسم خاکسپاری را، که اهالی «پلتورای مین»، تا کنون شاهدش بوده‌ اند، ایراد کرده‌ ام؛ خب، شاید جانانه‌ ترین سخنرانی نبود، و می‌توانست ناموفق‌ترین سخنرانی هم به حساب بیاید؛ فکر می‌کنم بستگی به این دارد، که نظر مادرم را بپرسید، یا نظر مرا؛ مادرم که احتمالاً تا یکسال، با من صحبت نخواهد کرد؛ سوء تفاهم نشود، سخنرانی من مانند سخنرانی خواهر «استیو جابز»، یا برادر «پت تیلمن»، در مراسم خاکسپاری آن‌ها نبود، که در تاریخ ثبت شود، اما در نوع خود، پرشور بود؛ اولش مضطرب بودم؛ هرچه نباشد مراسم خاکسپاری «اندرو بلوم» تحسین‌ برانگیز بود؛ شهردار محبوب شهر زادگاهم «پلتورای مین»، صاحب موفق‌ترین آژانس املاک، و مستغلات شهر، همسر «جنی بلوم» محبوب، که قابل احترام‌ترین کمک مدرس کل «پلتورا»ست، و پدر «لیلی بلوم» ـ همان دختر عجیب و غریب با موهای قرمز آشفته، که روزی عاشق یک مرد بی‌خانمان، و مایه‌ ی شرمساری کل خانواده شد؛ آن من بودم؛ من «لیلی بلوم» هستم، و «اندرو» پدرم بود؛ امروز به محض اینکه در مراسم خاکسپاری، در جایگاه تمجید از او صحبت کردم، یک بلیط هواپیما، مستقیم به مقصد «بوستون» گرفتم، و اولین پشت بام بلندی را که توانستم پیدا کنم، تصاحب کردم؛ باز هم، نه به این علت که اهل خودکشی هستم؛ من هیچ قصدی برای آنکه خودم را از این بالا پرت کنم، ندارم؛ فقط برای این به اینجا آمدم که واقعا به هوای تازه، و سکوت نیاز داشتم، و آپارتمان لعنتی‌ام در طبقه سوم، به فضای آزاد دسترسی ندارد، و هم‌اتاقی‌ام دوست دارد مدام صدای آواز خودش را بشنود.»؛ پایان نقلتاریخ بهنگام رسانی 28/06/1399هجری خورشیدی؛ ا. شربیانی"
1794,5.0,"Thank you Atria for providing an ARC via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review  I buddy read this book with sis Pearl -- click to read her captivating review :)To be honest, I still have a book hangover. It took me a while to organize my thoughts and come up with words. Most Colleen Hoover's books are emotional and definitely will give you butterflies but this sets on a more serious, deeper emotional level. I'm seriously not prepared to any of this and diving into this blind is simply the best decision and just go with the flow. You better grab some tissues and pillows while reading this book and comfort food when you finished it. I'll try my best not to give a spoiler. Here are my naked truths about It Ends With Us:- The story is so beautiful that it hurts too much. The message in this book left a huge impact as it centers on abusive relationships. - Lily Bloom's emotions felt raw and real.  I'm so torn between Atlas Corrigan; the homeless boy she first fell for and Ryle Kincaid; the gorgeous neurosurgeon she learned to love. - Certainly, you will root for someone and I actually love this character but by 50% mark -- BOOM. Everything changes and it slowly breaks my heart. It's a difficult situation to be in especially when you love this character and grows in you. Seeing a glimpse of his dark side wants you to walk away yet, a part of you wants to stay because you love him so much. It's harder to hate someone you love than hating a person you hate. We all have limits but how long does it take before it lasts? - I AM A CRYING MESS AND MY EMOTIONS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE. COMFORT FOOD IS A MUST.- I am satisfied with its ending. It may be a harsh reality but its necessary. At the same time, I can't help feeling sad with the situation. I have so much respect for Lily's character because her final decision takes guts to really do it. - The real story behind this book moved me. Make sure to read the author's note after reading the book. - Overall, I love this book. It's brilliantly written and not the typical romance. Definitely one of my favorites this year and this book dethrones November 9 as my favorite Colleen Hoover book. Hands down! "
1795,2.0,so goodreads decided to be a bitch and basically delete this book from my shelf so there goes my review and all the understanding comments and suggestions :))
1796,5.0,Currently sobbing so let me process what I'm feeling after reading this masterpiece and then I'll write a proper review bestiesUpdate: I cry every time I think about the book so I'm not emotionally stable to talk about it 
1797,5.0,"Re-read #2 (30/12/2019) This book breaks my heart in the most brutal way ever. That being said, I’m glad to be ending my year with one of my all time favorite books. Most deserved 5 stars! ""There's no such thing as bad people. we're all just people who sometimes do bad things""Oh! After finishing this book i spent two days in a haze. Was i sad? happy? frustrated? shocked? satisfied? I've got no idea!! This book made me feel alot of things. i nearly exploded from all these feelings and emotions! I finished it in a day. I just couldn't put it down!!i don't want to talk about the details of the book because, trust me, its way better to jump into it blindly. honestly, just jump into it!! Anyway, in the first forty percent or something in the book you'll feel like ""oh waaw!"" ""that's so nice"" ""oh really cute"" ""God! i'm in love"" you'll fall deeply in love with all the characters. All of them!!! Lily, Ryle, Atlas, lily's mam, and Alyssa her bestfriend.and, by all means, there is NOT a love triangle in this book. not at all. its more than that! its....ugghh! its jut more than that. ""In the future...if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again...fall in love with me.""Lily is a strong heroine. she's the definition of the word 'strength'. she might be one of the strongest female characters ever. she made me feel like a proud mama with the way she thinks, how she handles everything, and the choices she made. just because we didn't end up on the same wave, doesn't mean we aren't still a part of the same ocean.when you're done with the first forty percent, that's when all hell broke loose! that's the thing about colleen Hoover books, she knows how to hit you where it hurts! I've never questioned myself or my judgment like that, and dammit i felt bad! you know there are these situations where you know for sure whether this thing is right or wrong. No, that's not the case here. i know that i'm being vague, but trust me you don't want me to spoil this to you. And as hard as this choice is, we break the pattern before the pattern breaks us.This book changes your perspective. you can never put yourself in a place of someone else. the book teaches you not to be quick to judge. its not all black or white. you start to see the bigger/whole picture and you find yourself struggling, unsure what to do or how to think. it takes a really strong person to realize that.Colleen Hoover kind of made a huge impact on my life. she made me feel. In addition to that, i've always been a silent reader, so i made a promise that if i ever started writing reviews and voicing my thoughts, i would start with one of her amazing books. i just owe her that much. This book was beautiful, heavy, and made me feel so conflicted. it affected me in a way i never thought was possible. this is one of the stories that you'd never be able to forget. i spent days in a rollercoaster of emotions stopping every now and then unable to get over it.i've finally felt what is it like to get your heartbroken. It stops here. with me and you. it ends with us.Song recommendation:Blindside by Aquilo.Turning tables by Adele."
1798,5.0,"This was a 5-star read for me. I absolutely connected to these characters and the story. It wasn't perfect, but the importance to the story and my love for the content is what pushed it to a full 5 stars for me. Overall I think I think Colleen has her best work here in It Ends With Us. This is the story I have been waiting for from her. I highly recommend!*****SPOILERS AHEAD******I have not been in a physically abusive relationship but the cycle of abuse is familiar. It doesn't have to be romantic or even super obvious to be hurtful and damaging. This story really hit home for me and I am so happy I read it.I really connected to Lily's desire to see the best in someone and give them another chance. She had the best intentions and I think Colleen did an incredible job showing us the situation from the victims perspective - why leaving and walking away is not so easy or black and white. It's usually very complicated and has many layers. Abusers are often the person that abused person loves the most and can be very charming and hide it all so well. I think in a world where people can be so judgmental, it was refreshing to see this story challenge the reader to understand a perspective that most people don't see.I loved the ending, how Lily handled herself and did what she needed to be safe and independent. She had to maintain a relationship with her abuser because of the child, which is a very common thing most people don't stop to think about, and I applauded her maturity in the situation. I was glad she didn't jump into a new relationship right away - she had time to heal and grow and be on her own - but I am so excited for the prospect of her future love :)"
1799,5.0,"When I first read this book I couldn't process everything that happened. My emotions were far too invested in a particular character that I honestly couldn't fathom what the hell had happened. Even at the end after everything had happened, I was still completely blinded by my love for the character that I was pretty much just making excuses for the asshole character. However, after this reread I'm definitely able to put it into perspective and I didn't allow myself to like the asshole character and I was able to actually process and understand what the heck happened in this book.The above bit probably doesn't even make sense since I'm trying to be vague but let's roll with it. This book is honestly the most powerful book I've ever read in my entire life and I'm so glad that I read it. I have no words to say on this heartbreaking book so I'll just leave it here. Pick up this damn bookjust after finishing the second time:I leave for University in 10 minutes and I'm trying to put my makeup on and I can't even see my damn mirror because tears are streaming down my face. I didn't think this book would hurt me so much the second time around but I was clearly very wrong. I felt I took a lot away from this reread and it cleared a lot of things up for me in my head."
1800,5.0,"Wow, this was an amazing book. I enjoyed my first Colleen Hoover book, November 9th, but this one was just out of this world awesome. Lily Bloom, who has recently returned home to Boston after her father's funeral, meets Riall, a successful neurosurgeon. But is he the right man for her, or is it Atlas, the homeless boy she fell in love with in her hometown years ago? I LOVE the way Colleen Hoover so delicately and thoughtfully delves into the subject of abuse. It's so easy to simply say, ""Gosh, why don't people leave?"" and so difficult to comprehend all the forces that make leaving the hardest act in the world when you are at the hands of an abuser. It is not about smart and dumb. It is not about weak and strong. There are a thousand terrible threads tethering you to that... life, your life, and as Lily so aptly described it, it's like dying, but worse. Such poignant writing. I loved the relationship with Atlas, and also the friendship with Alyssa. I love it when strong female friendships are portrayed, and this one was just lovely. Trigger Warnings: (view spoiler)[ domestic abuse, attempted rape  (hide spoiler)]"
1801,5.0,"Holy shitballs this is a long review. I tried to trim but honestly, this is the best I can do and still say what I need to say. First off, some “naked truths.” I am a spoiler whore. I did not go into this book blind as is recommended. To the contrary I knew A LOT of the plot going in. To me, a review hidden behind a spoiler link is buried treasure. “THIS REVIEW IS HIDDEN BECAUSE IT CONTAINS SPOILERS” translates to EmmaSpeak as “SECRETS IN HERE! COME AND SEE!” Clickbait. I can’t resist. But also, I don’t necessarily like going in blind. I want to know stuff. I want to study mechanics and the inner blood and guts of the words on the page. Because I write myself, my main interest is not now seeing WHAT an author did, but HOW she did it. Plot is second to craft. Therefore, it’s safe to say that this review is going to be bursting to the seams in spoilers, under a cut or not. If you don’t want to be spoiled, you really shouldn’t read this. This is a review for those who have already read the book. The dozens of us. ;) OR….if you haven’t read it and don’t care about spoilers with the same glorious, carefree manner in which I don’t care about spoilers, than I shall tell you this book is about domestic violence. However, those words can’t convey the power and complexity contained within this novel. We have Ryle, this hot neurosurgeon with a temper who meets Lily, an aspiring florist, on a rooftop in Boston and so sets in motion their love story. Such as it is. I see why the author wanted you to go in blind, so you walk Lily’s path with her, fall in love with Ryle when she does, etc. But that was never going to happen with me. Even if I had gone in blind, I’d still take a separate journey than Lily, walking alongside her instead of in her shoes.I didn’t like Ryle from the get-go. He is not my cuppa H tea. At all. His actions (pre-abuse) rubbed me the wrong way so I was never going to like him. I was never going to root for them. I was never going to enjoy watching Lily fall for him. (Now Atlas, on the other hand, is an H I love to read about. He’s an H I love to WRITE about. Kind, considerate, and down on his luck. The trifecta of what makes a perfect H.)The fact that I’d spoilered myself all to hell about certain aspects of this book didn’t impinge on my ability to appreciate it. That is part of this book’s genius. I don’t know if the author realizes this, but one doesn’t have to like or love Ryle. It’s not about Ryle. This book is about Lily. Her choices and decisions, her pain and love, her heartache and triumphs, and—by extension—it’s about every woman who’s been in the situation she’s been in. Some other people this book is for: Women who have not been in this situation but think they know what they’d do if they were. (that’s my category)Women who have no idea what they’d do. Men who would never raise a hand to a woman in anger. Men who raise a hand to women in anger repeatedly and promise never to do it again. And it’s for every single solitary person—male or female—who has ever wondered, “Why does she stay?” instead of “Why does he hit?”Aside from the journal entries from Lily’s younger days and her past with Altas, I did not enjoy the first 25% of the book. Those journal entries and Atlas kept me going through the romance with Ryle I was never on board with, but it was when the shit hit the fan between he and Lily for the first time, that’s when this book skyrocketed.  I have not been in a situation like Lily’s so I have no personal frame of reference that would draw me closer to the story. And, as stated, I disliked Ryle from the get-go. Both those facts that should have given me a soft cushion of distance from the emotional impact the book. They did not. From the moment Ryle first lays a hand on Lily to the end of the last chapter, we are taken through the intricate, confusing, multi-layered thought processes of a woman trying to navigate her life in the face of an abusive partner. Someone she loves. A flesh and blood human to whom she has tied her life to, not some clichéd villain. We are taken from Lily’s first doubts and fears through a complex and escalating set of circumstances. The instances of abuse become worse in a sort of terrible parallel with how Lily’s life is more closely bound to Ryle’s. From being together, (being pushed), getting married, (getting thrown down the stairs) becoming pregnant, (becoming viciously attacked)… These instances are tangled together, and we are masterfully guided through Lily’s emotions, all her pain and fear, her love and joy, her doubt and self-loathing. It is an expertly mapped, masterful journey from A to Z, with no aspect left untouched, until finally she comes to an ultimate conclusion that somehow made me cheer in triumph and cry for her loss at the exact same fucking time. My parents were great, my husband is the epitome of kindness and grace. But I have an imagination. I have always imagined myself as the kind of woman who thought, should I ever become involved with an abusive man, I’d leave immediately. First time. No second chances, etc etc. I still think I’m that kind of woman, but I can use my imagination to create a bizarro world in which my husband turned on me. After working so hard for so many years we just moved to a new condo that is the best place we’ve ever lived. Our kids go to one of the best schools in the country. And so I imagine what would happen if I had to leave him. Would I have to move in with my parents who do not live anywhere near a good school system? Take the kids away from their friends. My friends? Would I strike out on my own? I’ve been out of the workforce, writing and raising kids for almost 10 years. Could I get a job to support the girls and me if I moved out? I think about the upheaval in my life of everything my hubs and I worked to build. How it would feel if it all had to come crashing down. How our family would be ripped apart. How I’d have to explain to the girls what happened…Or I could just give him one more chance and keep everything as is. I could take the emotional turmoil and suck it down, keep it inside, so that the surface remains placid and calm, and tell myself it’s for the greater good. “I have a feeling reasoning really kicked her ass a time or two.”A-fucking-men. There is a right answer to this scenario but never, EVER should it be assumed that it's an easy one to make. That right there, is why this book gets five enormous stars. What Lily experienced is not the experience of every abused woman. But it’s not about plot, remember? It’s about the how and the why. To my mind, this author captured and conveyed the essence of this particular brand of emotional turmoil and set it in a context that even this reader, who has no personal frame of reference to speak of, reached complete and utter understanding. And understanding does more to foster positive change in this world than anything else. ES"
1802,5.0,"** 5 ""HOLY SHIT CoHo DID IT AGAIN !"" ** Finally !! I should have known Collen Hoover would be the one to get me out of my reading slump ! I mean, not one of her books ever failed to me, so it really comes as no surprise that I loved this book just as much as each of her previous ones !This review is going to be different from my usual reviews, because in my opinion I can’t go into much detail about the story or the characters or else it would ruin the entire thing to future readers. I think you really don’t need to know much before diving into this book, or any CoHo’s book for that matter ^^ Beforehand, I only read the synopsis and didn’t even read early reviews, I just jumped right into it completely blind, and what I got was definitely not what I was expecting at ALL, the synopsis doesn’t give any hint as to what you’re actually going to get with this story, and I loved it because I love being surprised by books, especially in NA, and CoHo never fails to surprise me with her amazing and unexpected twists, realistic and meaningful characters and serious, sometimes tough, subjects. Like always with her books, I was hooked right from the first sentence, which, let’s be honest, doesn’t happen often for me. Colleen has such a way to make the book so addicting, I was honestly not able to put the book down, which ultimately resulted in my reading it within a day :DShe always writes about female characters who feel so real and to whom it’s really easy to identify, making the story that much more emotional and powerful. Lily, the MC in It Ends With Us, was the star of the book : it’s all about her, her strength, her love, her ambition, her fears. She made me feel everything with her : love, sadness, anger, fear, doubt, guilt, I was completely rooting for her the entire book, she totally made the book !
  Ellen, I am confident that the next sentence I am about to write has never been written or spoken aloud before. When he was wiping that cow shit on me, it was quite possibly the most turned-on I have ever been. 
I also love CoHo’s way of talking about serious and difficult subjects in such a subtle way. She tells her stories with such simple yet beautiful, truthful and meaningful words, and she never fails to make me an emotional mess at the end of it, making me think really hard about life, making me think back on some beliefs, making you try to understand other people’s minds and way of thinking or why they do certain things. Colleen always manages to reach and move me deeply with her imperfect yet beautiful characters and the way she chooses to tell their story in such a unique and wonderful way.   ""In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.” He presses his lips against my forehead. “You’re still my favorite person, Lily. Always will be."" I don’t know if this review is very helpful, but trust me that you really need to go into this book blind and it will take you on an unexpected and beautiful, but also heartbreaking journey with Lily. It’s really not often a book manages to make me feel so many different emotions, to the point I even cried (which is quite rare for me), but it’s Colleen Hoover we’re talking about, she does it perfectly, this woman is a brilliant writer in my opinion, and the fact that this story in particular comes from her personal experience makes it even more meaningful and real. Overall, if there’s one way to sum up this entire book without revealing too much, this quote from the book does it perfectly : 
 ""There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things."" 
 P.S. : If from reading the synopsis you’re fearing a love triangle, NO WORRIES ! There is absolutely NO LOVE TRIANGLE in this book, so you’re safe, trust me ;)"
1803,5.0,"If you're breathing, you MUST, MUST, MUST read It Ends With Us!I have to preface this with saying that I'm the world's biggest snoop. When I friend people on Goodreads I like to look at their favorites list, and THIS book kept reoccurring over and over again, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Why did I wait so long? I have no excuse.Lily Bloom grows up in an abusive household in Maine, and befriends a boy named Atlas who changes her life. Life pulls them in different directions, and after she graduates from college, she moves to Boston. There she meets a neurosurgeon named Ryle, a man who swears he doesn't do relationships, but fate has a weird way of working in people's lives, and they fall in love. I won't say any more than that, there are so many delicious layers to this novel. I'm not going to lie, I'm not big on romance novels, but this one was an exception to say the very least! I couldn't turn the pages fast enough, and I couldn't put the Kleenex down. My Goodness! I've got to say, this is one of those books I was so sad to finish. You know, when you come across a book and think, ""How is anything going to measure up to this after I finish it?"" Well, that's how I feel. I look at my TBR pile and know that there are so many great books to come, but THIS one, well, this one will always have a piece of my heart!"
1804,1.0,"Incredibly predictable, highly overrated and full of characters and ridiculous moments I disliked."
1805,1.0,"Read as part of the ABN Summer Reading Challenge recommended by Lizzie but this has also been recommended to me by a bunch of other people too including Zoha, Masooma and Alafiya... Guys did we read a completely different book??? This book deals with a very delicate subject matter. That of domestic abuse and its associated horrors so be advised there are trigger warnings for abuse in the home including physical, emotional and sexual. (view spoiler)[I get what CoHo was trying to do with this book. How she was trying to paint the picture of how you could unwittingly find yourself in a domestic abuse situation but still struggle with loving and staying with a man who hurts you. But for me this book did not work at all. And I 100% blame CoHo because in my opinion her writing utterly lacks gravitas. It's impossible not to be moved by her author's note that describes her familial experience but despite her personal knowledge of domestic abuse I did not find myself empathising with her fictional characters at all. I felt that the first 50% was an incredibly poor set up for the relationship between Lily and Ryle. It felt like standard NA schlock with an alpha male type love interest and a girl trying to run from her past. I did not believe the romance. It was hello I'm a hot moody bad boy neurosurgeon who wants to screw your brains out but I don't do relationships... Five pages later there's a quasi-relationship but nothing that felt genuine or deep. So that by the time Lily told us how so in love with Ryle she was and found herself somehow married to him I had utterly lost any interest in them as a couple because it simply did not feel like a believably deep and meaningful relationship. And that to me was the biggest flaw of this book. Because I kept querying the why was Lily with Ryle. And that is exactly what I wasn't supposed to do as a reader!!! Because we all know that any one of us could end up in a domestic abuse situation. Like surely that was CoHo's aim? That we were supposed to understand this relationship. And to feel the pain and the trauma and the heartbreak. But because CoHo had written Ryle like an alpha douchebag from page one I kept thinking to myself well surely Lily won't stay with him because in my opinion he's got very unfavourable traits and characteristics from the get go. So she can't fall in love with this kind of man can she? I thought Ryle displayed a lot of domineering traits and some possessive ones very early on in the book before they had gotten serious / married etc. so I couldn't understand it. Lily seemed smart. She seemed clued in but then got swept away in this love story that to me did not work. I personally felt there was an almost romanticised style to their relationship; the eloping to Vegas and thinking you'd have all the discussions that a couple needs to have before embarking on a lifelong commitment during a short plane ride from Boston to Vegas??? Not realistic or incredibly naïve... I don't know... Didn't sit right with me. And that whole sexual situation with the stethoscope?? Was anyone else not weirded out by that? To me that was him displaying such dominance over her and because it happened relatively early on in their relationship I couldn't understand how that didn't trigger warning signals for Lily. I honestly thought that CoHo was going to throw a plot twist at us and have Atlas be the abuser from Lily's past because I thought Ryle's early behaviours were far too obvious. I mean maybe if I hadn't known the book was about domestic abuse from the beginning I might have been led along and then more shocked by Ryle's abusive behaviours???? Doubtful though...Admittedly the story improved slightly once Lily realised she was in a domestic abuse situation and there were some nice insights into how she felt regarding guilt-wise, struggling with her emotions about loving a man who hurt her, wanting to protect her unborn child etc. But all this was slathered in ridiculous melodrama especially with Atlas coming to the rescue and that utterly eye roll worthy epilogue of them coming together... She called her kid Dory..... I legit can't. And giving Ryle an excuse for his abusive behaviour and wrapping things up so neatly with him being a good daddy????? Eh no. Don't buy that at all.  (hide spoiler)]So I'm sorry to those people that love this book especially my friends who recommended it to me. I do think this theme is something that needs to be talked about openly and honestly so that we can rid the perceived shame associated with domestic abuse. Because anyone can find themselves in this situation. Anyone. So for those reasons books that focus on domestic abuse are definitely worth reading and discussing. But this one... Sorry. This just wasn't to my taste because the NA aspect and poor writing really detracted from the serious theme for me. It took every inch of my will power to finish this. This was my second read by CoHo and it will most definitely be my last. A book that I preferred that dealt with the issue of Domestic Abuse is They Were Sisters. To me that was written with much more gravitas and empathy."

(Confession: Trust me, the urge to throwing the book out the window was real.)Guys, I feel so betrayed like this book should've came with a note before I purchased it saying: 

""WARNING: THIS BOOK WILL PSYCHOLOGICALLY, EMOTIONALLY, AND PHYSICALLY DESTROY YOUR SOUL. ENJOY YOUR READ!"" 

Expect a lawsuit for the multiple cardiac arrests I suffered. I almost pre-called the ambulance because I couldn't fight off the feels. Ohh the feels! Thank you, Colleen Hoover, because you've done it again. She has finally wrecked my heart with her beautifully developed plots, compelling characters, and jealous-worthy romance.  As I was reading this, I'll be honest if I tell you that I didn't curse Colleen Hoover.I cursed her. A LOTTrust me, I had 6 valid reasons as to why I did:Reason #1: This book invaded my entire soul and shredded it into tiny, little pieces. (It is beyond repairable) Reason#2:  My tears turned my room into an ocean like my mop officially gave up around page 50. Reason#3:  I think I need a therapist to cope with my withdrawals. Reason#4: Why hasn't anyone invented a rewind button? Because I need it. Reason#5: Reason#6: Repeat again I will love nothing more than to continue this rant of how Colleen Hoover demolished my entire existence with only 384 pages but it's time to get serious. Shall we start? (Note: This is spoiler-free review so you may proceed without any caution)

It Ends With Us

, is a story told by MC Lily Bloom. (Yes, that's her real name but get this. Her middle name is Blossom. I can't even!) Reading the back cover, you already know that something deep, personal and life-changing is going to happen. Lily's life was never easy for major reasons but it didn't chain her down. You get to witness how certain people and events impact her. You learn how these certain things shape and build her into the individual she is. Ryle and Atlas, dear lord, I don't even know where to start with them. Prepare yourselves for them. That's all. I was aware that any book I pick up and read by Colleen Hoover will somehow shred my heart like a tasmanian devil but I was totally unprepared for this. I felt like every page I read, I was hit by a truck load of feels. The plot can be interpreted in a lot of interesting ways but it was soooooooooooo far from what Colleen Hoover really had in store for us. She ventured out to a whole new level and I'm thrilled that she was able to produce a soul-wrenching book. I had the opportunity to step into someone else's shoes and experience a story that is most likely hard to accept and understand in some parts of society. Okay, I don't think I have the confidence to discuss the author's note because:  A) I'm still sobbing.  B) I'm still sobbing.  C) I'm still sobbing. Anyone who is still breathing and haven't read this then I will come after you and be like: You can find this review and my other reviews at Booksprens "

1810,5.0,"Reviewed by: Hello Beautiful Book Blog
Colleen Hoover has written her most powerful novel yet. In this book, nothing is black and white. The experience It Ends With Us gave me was unforgettable and changed my perception of looking in from the outside.
This is a book people 
need
 to read.
“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”
This review is probably going to be pretty short because I refuse to give any details as far as the plot. This book is one you MUST go into blind. I finally understand why Colleen said to start the book that way. Getting to go through everything with Lily was an unforgettable experience. You have to experience everything alongside Lily. You have to be her and find yourself wondering what just happened and what is going on. I promise you, if you read spoilers it will take away from your experience of reading this book for the first time.
“You’re really beautiful when you’re happy.”
You will find that everything is not as black and white as you once thought. There are more shades of grey than are found in Mr. Grey's closet. I found myself wanting to apologize to people I had once judged. This book is an eye opener. I love that so many people are understanding the message. It is a wonderful thing. The raw emotion that Hoover puts on the page makes this book so special. I would encourage everyone to read this, but especially if you are a woman.
“Naked truths aren’t always pretty.”
Lily as a main character was wonderful. She is driven and passionate. She is strong despite her weaknesses. She was a joy to read. I loved Lily and her strength. As every CoHo book has, there were some amazing secondary characters! Allysa and Marshall were hilarious and such good friends to Lily. Other characters who make a short appearance are also hilarious and provide some good comic relief. I always end up loving the side characters almost as much as the main characters in her books. Hoover can make them so real.
“In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.”
If you have read this book I urge you to join the discussion group on Facebook, but not until you've read it. There are so many telling their stories and I am loving the empowerment and understanding this book is bringing forth.Make sure you read the author note after finishing the book. That was one of my favorite parts. CoHo has done it again. I love this woman. It has to end with us.
“Be that girl, Lily. Brave and bold.”
♥******I finally understand why Colleen said to go in blind. Getting to go through everything with Lily was an unforgettable experience. All I have to say is read this now. Nothing is black and white.******It's here! I won't be getting much work done today because It Ends With Us is taking over my life! I can't believe it's finally here!Is that my heart cracking already?"
1811,5.0,"I am a big Colleen Hoover fan. I love everything that she writes. And this book is no exception. I loved it! I also loved when the title was mentioned in the book and I realized what it truly meant.This book is nothing like anything she has written before. I would strongly recommend knowing as little as possible about this book before reading it. You won't regret it.And wow the author's note was incredible.It Ends With Us is a standalone New Adult/Adult contemporary romance. The narrator is 23 year old Lily Bloom.Lily grew up in Maine but now lives in Boston. When the book starts Lily has just come back from a funeral. The book is mostly in the present. But Lily does spend time reflecting on her past. I absolutely loved how this was done (one of the author's favorite celebrities is used in a very unique way).There are a bunch of very intriguing characters in this book. The first is Ryle (rhymes with Kyle) an almost 30 year old neurosurgeon.Another character I must mention is Allysa. She is probably my favorite female character ever. I love her so much. There really are no words.The cover of It Ends With Us is stunning and perfect. The title is easy to remember and perfect for the book.There were just so many amazing twists and turns in this book. I really cannot say enough good things about this story. It is amazing. It is captivating. It is thought-provoking. It is incredible. It is awesome and impressive and exceptional. Just read this book!Final spoiler thoughts (do not read unless you have read the book): (view spoiler)[ At about 50% this book becomes something that I did not expect. When Ryle hurt her I was stunned. And when I found out what he had gone through as a kid it made me confused. Was I not supposed to love Ryle anymore?? And the way Atlas was weaved into various points of the story ... it was fantastic. As I was getting closer to the end I was wondering if Lily would get her HEA ending. I am not even sure what I would say if someone asked me if this book has a HEA. The emotional impact of everything Lily and Ryle went through ... Also when I read the author's note I almost lost it. That was probably the most shocking part of the whole book. Has an author's note ever been so important and relevant and impactful? It is one of the most powerful things that I have ever read. (hide spoiler)]In conclusion, if you love Coho's books then you will love this one. If you have never tried a Colleen Hoover book then you need to start here. This book is gripping and engrossing. But it is also one of the most significant books of 2016. This is a must read."
1812,5.0,"Incredibly heavy, but a must read. Highly recommend."
1813,5.0,"With It Ends With Us, Colleen Hoover delivers what could be her boldest, most ambitious and evocative work to date. Brave, intimate and simultaneously hopeful and heartbreaking, Hoover imparts a story about choices. The bad ones good people sometimes make. The ones that leave scars no one can see. The ones we muster courage to make so that we can break free from a life we never intended.And while It Ends With Us is certainly a story shaped by choices, it’s also one which embodies courage, strength and resilience.For Hoover, this book is intensely personal, and as a reader, I felt it. Felt the heart and honesty of it. Every moment trembled with a vulnerability that echoed deeply, effectively driving home the true and sweeping devastation of the circumstances we often find ourselves in.
“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”
As a teenager, Lily met Atlas Corrigan, a homeless boy who’d grown up in a similar situation, and they clung to each other during the worst times of their lives. Atlas was thoughtful, caring, bright, and so when he moves away to reach for a better life, Lily was crushed.
“I’m going to make a promise to you… When my life is good enough for you to be a part of it, I’ll come find you.”
Years later, on the day of her father’s funeral, Lily meets Ryle Kinkaid atop a Boston roof in the middle of the night. A charming and talented neurosurgeon, Ryle quickly gets under her skin. And while Lily learns Ryle doesn’t do relationships, and she, in turn, doesn’t do one-night stands, she can’t seem to forget that single night, that string of shared moments. She never thought she’d see him again, but fate had other plans.Despite Ryle’s relationship avoidance, he can’t seem to deny the growing connection between them.
“Oh, I want you, Lily. Make no mistake about that. I just don’t want to want you.”
Just as Ryle and Lily’s relationship takes flight, Atlas is back, dredging up all the love and longing she'd once felt for him.But when Lily finds herself thrust into a life that resembles her ugly past, she learns just how difficult it can be to walk away. Both of these men shape Lily’s life in ways unforeseen, both of them love her deeply, one of them becomes her life raft.
“I love you, Lily. Everything you are. I love you.”
Beyond what I've told you, you should go into the story blind, braced for a story that is raw and heart wrenching. You’ll feel Lily's experiences in your heart, in your soul, in your gut. She’s a fierce example of courage and resilience. And of course, despite the heavier topics it explores, it wouldn’t be a Colleen Hoover novel without her singular kind of magic making it all the more special.Brave and bold, emotive and edgy, intimate and irresistible—It Ends With Us will leave its mark.✦ ✦ ✦ ✦ Follow Vilma's Book Blog:  Website | Facebook |  Twitter  | Instagram"
1814,5.0," Holy crap, what a powerful book. It took me some time to gather my thoughts about it, because right after I finished it this was all I could do:  Hoover usually succeeds at hitting me right in the feels but she has taken things to a whole new level with this book. It Ends With Us is one of those books where you have to go into it not knowing anything about it. I would recommend reading this review only if you've already finished the book. All you have to know before reading it is that you NEED to read it.  Lily Bloom: Probably one of my all time favorite female characters. I admired her for the choices she made and I felt her pain and struggle every step of the way.  Ryle: Gah Ryle. A neurosurgeon you guys. Let's be honest, we all fell in love with him. I love that I went into this book not knowing that it dealt with an abusive relationship because I wasn't looking for it. Just like Lily wasn't looking for it. I fell in love with Ryle when Lily fell in love with him so I totally understood her struggle when came time to let him go. I found myself wondering how many chances I would have given him if I were Lily. Just take a moment and ask yourself? Would you have left before? At the same time Lily did? or maybe later? Never? It is a lot easier to judge an abusive relationship when you're not actually in it, but in most cases those girls who stay are usually in love with the abuser. I know it might sound weird to be in love with someone who physically or emotionally hurts you but this book portrays how something like that can happen. There are so many more factors that are intertwined in every relationship so leaving might be a lot harder you think it is.  Atlas: *sigh* I had such a soft spot for Atlas in my heart. I pretty much cried in every scene that involved him. Happy tears, sad tears, all the tears! ALL OF THEM!  The letters to Ellen were my favorite part of the book. I really hope she reads this book one day. I don't think I've ever read a book that felt this real and I feel like it has a lot to do with the fact that Colleen Hoover based this book off of a real situation. I didn't think it was possible to love this author more than I already did but she proved me wrong.  Ps:Colleen Hoover, I want to be you when I grow up. "
1815,5.0,"Dear Colleen,Since Lily wrote letters to Ellen DeGeneres, her favorite TV host, as a diary to tell her and Atlas' story, I thought it'd be a great idea to write the letter to you, my favorite author, as a review.I have a confession to make...I actually picked this book up more than 10 times in this past two years but I couldn't in the life of me get past the first few chapters. I knew It Ends with Us was going to be different from your other books. So, I just stopped because at that time, I was into a sickeningly sweet romance. I'm glad that I did, though. If I read your book then, I wouldn't appreciate it as much as I do now.I read It Ends with Us just the way you told me to ... not tear out most of the pages. It was intense and made a powerful impact on my heart... My heart shattered into pieces while reading it.Your book made me cry and scream.You completely wrecked me, Colleen.Even before I read 'note from the author', I could feel that you were addressing something close to your heart. I saw it in every word... the sadness and the pain. Things only those who experienced knew. It's been days since I finished your book but just thinking of the raw, painful, inspirational and beautiful story and characters are enough to make my eyes well up. (I will not cry. I will not cry again.)It Ends with Us wasn't your usual new adult romance. You daringly poured your heart out ... you made the romance to be a background and a domestic abuse to be a front and center of this story. I've to admit before (and while) reading this book, I was one of those people who asked why they didn't leave ... just walk away. I didn't know it was more complicated than that ... the emotions (love, hate, and anger) made everything so much harder. You opened my eyes to that. Your book somehow changed me.I also wanted to thank you to introduce me to Lily. She was the epitome of brave and bold. I love her so much. I was proud of her and the choices she made. I really want to be her when I grow up.I've read most of your book (I still haven't read November 9 and Without Merit) but It Ends with Us is by far your finest work and it always has a special place in my heart.-Khungkhing"
1816,4.0,"This could be a spoiler review.... Don’t read on if you are afraid... OK so the first half of the book for me felt almost like a YA book. I give it 3 1/2 Stars. YA for me almost never works. The Ellen Diaries at first didn’t work for me. The second half of the book for me was a 5 Star book. Things came together and even The Ellen Diaries came together. I would love to have read this book in my later teens or early 20’s because I experienced domestic abuse from my first husband. I listened to the audio. This is the second book I have read by Colleen Hoover. I didn’t like it nearly as much as the first, “November 9”. I’m late to the party but I would highly recommend this book for women 17-30. Learn about the cycle of abuse early. People don’t change. History repeats."
1817,5.0,"ARC provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review

Bold. Raw. Uncut. Honest. Beautiful. The Naked Truth. Those are the only words that I can describe this heartfelt and powerful book. It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover is one of those rare reads that speaks to you on a deeper and meaningful level. The writing was flawless. The characters were flawed. And the raw poignant and beautiful emotions spoke the naked truth. So how can a book with flawed characters be perfect? It’s simple. This book doesn’t hide anything. It doesn’t sweep anything under the rug. Every bad mistake, choice, love, and action are laid bare for everyone to see that your happiness lies solely in your hands. 

“You warned me. You said one time with you wouldn’t be enough. You said you were like a drug. But you failed to tell me you were the most addictive kind.”I honestly don’t want to recap on what I just read but I want to tell you why this book needs to be read. Here’s the naked truth. We all can say we should of done this, why doesn’t the person leave, or have a plethora of excuses. But in all honesty, you can’t say it until you have lived it. And so I would like to thank Colleen Hoover for writing such an engrossing, inspirational, bold, and raw story of love, second chances, hope and new beginnings. So I think it's fitting that I conclude this review with a letter to CoHo.

“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.” Dear Colleen,Thank you. Thank you for writing a story that strips you bare and exposes every insecurity, flaw, beauty, and vulnerability. Thank you for writing a story that is more than just romance. Thank you for writing a story that inspires, gives hope, and most importantly provide comfort to every Lily out there. Thank you for being awesome. Thank you for your heartfelt prose. And lastly, thank you for the story of Atlas, Lily, and Ryle. ~Michelle, a girl who is still swimming. xo

1818,5.0,"WOW! I feel like I'm just echoing everyone when I say this is Colleen Hoover's BEST WORK YET. She is my favorite author and of course I love all of her work, but she completely hit it out of the park with this one. I'm so glad I had the time to sit an devour this book in one sitting because I'm not sure I could've handled having to put this one down.I know everyone keeps saying to go into this one blind and I fully agree. Personally this is how I go into all of CoHo's books. I may read the blurb prior to the book being released, but I never go back to read it again before I read the actual book. Sometimes it's just better to experience the journey yourself and this is one of those books. The reward at the end of the journey is so worth it. So, once again I'll echo others and not go into the story, but just talk about the things I liked.Colleen has a way with all of her books that really makes you feel. With this book, I felt as though I were walking in Lily's shoes. I loved when she loved and my heart broke when her's did. I felt anger, guilt and confusion for loving the guy who could bring her so much pain. I too wanted to make excuses and hated myself for it. I loved both Ryle and Atlas. They were Lily's two loves at different times in her life and both loved her deeply. I loved the ""naked truth"" times. It's so refreshing to see characters be that open and honest with each other. I honestly didn't know how the story was going to end, but my heart beat rapidly with anticipation. I love when we get to the parts in stories where the title of the book is used, but this one...completely wrecked me. It was so fitting, yet so heartbreaking. It still brings tears to my eyes just thinking about it. Colleen deserves a huge round of applause for this book. The note from the author at the end...Wow! An applause for Colleen's mother too. ""All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.""I can't recommend this book enough. READ. THIS. BOOK!! It's up there on my all time favorite list."

1820,5.0,"Suddenly I start thinking about this book and feel it deserves all 5 stars, not a bit removed from it. Therefore  5 stars4.75 stars I guess that doesn't matter I ended up giving it 5 stars anyway. Childhood friends to lovers are my favorite trope, I like it even more than enemies to lovers. I liked the concept of this book, it felt so realistic, I liked how it was showcased & that finally, someone put light on this issue. I liked that it showed no matter how the person seems to be good, that person can still be bad and it shouldn't be ignored and I liked that despite all the good things about Ryle, Lily didn't end up with him that she didn't ignore all alarming things about him.I might have rated this book 4.75/5 stars but I was not so sure about that till the last chapter. Around 50% I was like 'I will rate this book 5 stars' then somewhere around 92% I was like 'I will rate this book 4/4.5 stars'. The reason why I was going to rate this book 4/4.5 stars was that enough content of Atlas was not given, I wanted more! But later on, I found that this book is not romance so I can't really complain(Why has Goodreads marked it as romance? And it won choice awards too?!! CoHo herself told me this isn't a romance). Somewhere in starting, I didn't feel that connection between Ryle and Lily but since I knew they weren't going to end up together I didn't care about that much but later on though I did feel the connection between them which made things more realistic and increased the number of stars for this book. Also, the note from the author changed my mind about this book a lot and I concluded to give this book 4.75/5 stars.I was really curious to read this book because I knew it was related to the author's personal life.Overall this book is really good I liked it the only thing that I wanted more of Atlas😭😭 Also I didn't find few things relatable with what Lily went through, I understood her, sympathized with her but couldn't empathize with her.P.S: Let me take a moment and appreciate the cover it's just so beautiful, suits this book and it looks even better in hardcover format 😇"
1821,5.0,"Hopeless has always been my favorite since it came out and while I've loved all subsequent books nothing ever topped it, until It Ends With Us ... This book tore me to pieces but healed me in the last 5 pages ... It's honestly very hard to review this book without spoiling it, so I'll be brief.I went into It Ends with us completely blind, had no idea what it was about, not even what the character names were. What I found was a story so raw and real that I had to stop to breath and gather myself to continue on reading several times. This book was very personal to me as I have been in the situation the protagonist will find herself in and at times it hit so close to home that I truly felt like I just couldn't continue. It didn't help that I was reading this on a plane and the people next to me more than likely thought I was having a nervous breakdown ha! The most I can say about this book without giving anything away is that Colleen went deep into the characters, to portray a situation so many people find themselves in and sometimes don't know how to find the way out. She found the good in the characters even through their flaws, even when the good didn't redeem them for the bad. If you have never read a book by Colleen, this is the book you want to read. I found myself laughing, swooning and then bawling ... I was angry and then resigned. By the time I was done with this book I can almost say it was therapeutic, at least for me. It Ends With Us, holds now a very special place in my heart because sometimes there are situations in life that make us feel so alone you feel like you are the only person in the entire universe, but this book reminded me that we are never alone, and there are always people who are going through the same kind of struggles that will want to help and be there for you, if you allow them to help. It also very much reminded me that to be able to love others fully you have to start with yourself. "
1822,5.0,"This is a completely spoiler free review. It’s not even a proper review. It’s just me saying that every person should read a book like this one. It is probably one of the most meaningful and powerful books I’ve ever read.I thought what I loved the most about Colleen’s books was the romance; the characters falling in love, then having to face something, but ultimately finding love again. And she always does that beautifully. But what I learned from this book, is that what I love the most about Colleen’s stories are the women. And Lily, more than the others, had an incredible impact on me. What Colleen succeeded in portraying in this book, is honestly one of the most important lessons girls, and boys alike, should learn today.I wanted so badly to pretend like some scenes never happened, to find a reason, to just skip them. But that’s exactly the point. I wanted things to be different. But that’s not how life works. The truth was just one. Even if it hurts. I read through this book feeling an heaviness in my chest. I was dreading reading on, but at the same time I knew that I had to keep swimming to find the shore.I can’t even tell how many times I smiled, how many times I cried, how confused I was, how heartbroken, and how healed I felt. I will treasure this experience forever. I don’t know how to thank Colleen for the courage and honesty that took her to write and share this book. She tried, and succeeded in showing how we deserve to be loved.Now, I’m going to spend the rest of the day crying.This review can also be found at calloway books"

My mom gave me a rag and told me to hold it to my head because it was bleeding and then she helped me to her car and drove me to the hospital. On the way there she only said one thing to me.“When they ask you what happened, tell them you slipped on the ice.”
I was a mess after finishing this book. It absolutely broke my heart. It was unlike anything I've read by Colleen Hoover, and I mean that in the best possible way. It started out much like her other romance novels - our protagonist, Lily, meets a man on a rooftop, Ryle. There they pour out their hearts to each other in the form of ""naked truths."" They don't see each other again for six months.At the beginning, I noticed that the romance felt much older and more realistic than that of Hoover's previous books. Sorry, I'm just not a fan of the perfectly boring ""bad boys"" in Ugly Love and Confess who are nothing more than control freaks. That is so not hot to me.Ryle, however, was a whole different story. He was charming, smart, considerate, and flawed. As Lily got to know him, I tried to resist his charms, wary of another New Adult love interest. But I couldn't resist him for long. As Lily fell in love, so did I. Ryle seemed too good to be true, something a girl could only dream up. Everything in his and Lily's life was going so wonderfully, it was like something out of a fairytale.And then, after one simple act, everything came crashing down.I don't want to spoil the plot, as I think one of the best things about it is how gradual it progresses and when the big thing happens, it comes as a shock to the reader and changes absolutely everything. I know I'm being cryptic, but I really don't want to give any more details away.It Ends with Us was an emotional rollercoaster. I cried more than once, I felt everything Lily was going through, and I felt pity for those who warranted nothing more than my absolute hatred. The characters weren't black and white, but messy and complicated and beautiful. I have only felt this much for a very few amount of books. It was such a powerful, raw, and informative story.The writing was page turning and completely engrossing. There were so many gorgeous quotes about life and love that I seriously wanted to include ten paragraphs in my review. I felt all the right things at exactly the right time. When I came to the end and reached the Author's Note, I started tearing up again as Hoover shared her own personal story.
“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”
I can't say much else other than read this book. If you're a fan of Hoover's previous works, read it. If not, read it. If you never venture into the New Adult genre, I strongly recommend giving It Ends with Us a try. It was truly amazing."

TITLE: It Ends with UsAUTHOR: Colleen HooverGENRE: Contemporary RomanceCHAPTERS: RELEASE DATE: August 2nd, 2016MY RATING: 5 STARS
 Sometimes the one who loves you is the one who hurts you the most.


IT ENDS WITH US: Twelve hours earlier twenty-three year old Lily Bloom had just buried her father and went to the one roof top that she'd google earthed as having a roof top patio to just reflect on the passing of her father. 
 “ buried my father today and gave an epically disastrous eulogyand now I feel like I can't breathe. ”
A chance encounter with a man on a roof top. A straight shooter who tells it as he sees it. Meet twenty-nine year old Ryle, a heart throb neurosurgeon. An undeniable attraction. 
 “I feel like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down we’re all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others.” 
These two hit it off straight away, BUT as the night progresses they both want different things out of life, he wants to have a one night stand, she just wants more. Weeks go by Another chance encounter, he's the brother of a girl that's helping her set up her florist shop. As questions start to overwhelm her about Ryle, she can't help but reflect about Atlas Corrigan her first love, the homeless guy who was trespassing in the abandoned house next door. This duo formed an unlikely friendship when she was fifteen.

 I know it's been years since I saw him, but I'll never forget what he looked like.It had to be him. I know it was and I know he recognised me, too, because the second our eyes met...It looked like he'd seen a ghost.So I kind of had to jump on the bandwagon with this one, not only because I'm a HUGE #COHOFAN but because of all the currently reading stats and the five star reviews that followed..And I am sooooooo freaking glad I did!! The FEELS!! If you haven't one clicked this do et!! Seriously this is epic, it's so much more than just a love story, it pulls at your heart strings and doesn't let go, it tears it to shreds, and stomps on it, you'll be stuck on an emotional rollercoaster, laughter one minute, sighing the next, frustrated one second, crying the next..A yoyo has nothing on the turmoil this book throws at you!! It's been a few days since I finished this, it's still as fresh on my mind as the day I read those last words, it's also left me in a huge bugga of a book funk. Loved this book, such a powerful, emotional, heartbreaking story. Highly recommend to all!!

1832,4.0,"EXCERPT: As I sit here with one foot on either side of the ledge, looking down from twelve storeys above the streets of Boston, I can't help but think about suicide. Not my own. I like my life enough to want to see it through. I'm more focused on other people, and how they ultimately come to the decision to just end their own lives. Do they ever regret it? In the moment after letting go and the second before they make impact, there has to be a little bit of remorse in that brief free fall. Do they look at the ground as it rushes toward them and think, 'Well crap, this was a bad idea.'Somehow, I think not. I think about death a lot. Particularly today, considering I just - twelve hours earlier - gave one of the most epic eulogies the people of Plethora, Maine, have ever witnessed. Okay, maybe it wasn't the most epic. It very well could be considered the most disastrous. I guess that would depend on whether you were asking my mother or me. My mother, who probably won't speak to me for a solid year after today. ABOUT THIS BOOK: Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up— she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. And the way he looks in scrubs certainly doesn’t hurt. Lily can’t get him out of her head. But Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the exception to his “no dating” rule, she can’t help but wonder what made him that way in the first place.As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan — her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.MY THOUGHTS: Before starting It Ends With Us, I was a Colleen Hoover virgin. 'Where have you been?' you ask. Well, the short answer is, I don't read romance. Except for Susan Mallery, and now I am adding CoHo to my list. Because really, the romance isn't the point of this book, it's the vessel by which she delivers her message about domestic violence. You know - that thing about which we all say, 'I'd never put up with that! Once would be one time too many. I'd be gone and I'd have his/her sorry arse in jail.' Yes, that's what we all say, but if that is actually what happens, the world would be a different place. And Lily knows all about domestic violence. Her father had used her mother as his own personal punching bag for as long as Lily can remember. She hated her father for hurting her mother, she hated her mother for not leaving, and she hated herself for not being able to stop him. So how does Lily end up in the same position? Read it and find out. Everyone, man and woman, should read It Ends With Us. 🤕🤕🤕🤕THE AUTHOR: International and #1 New York Times bestselling author of romance, YA, thriller and Women's Fiction.

“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”

Lily Bloom's life was perfect with all her dreams coming true and finding Ryle Kincaid in her life; she was complete. When someone from the past comes back she was reminded that about risks and her priorities. Ryle Kincaid was successful and he was every woman's dream man. He felt complete with Lily and life was just exactly how it should be. I personally found this story very emotional. I was one hundred percent happy with the final choice Lily had to make for the love of her family. Breaking the cycle scene was one I was ugly crying of happiness, I am sure others probably wouldn't understand but as a parent it would have been such a hard choice but yet the only choice. I personally think you'll need to go blinded into the story however just know the subject in the story is very deep family stuff and is not for soft hearts.It ends with us is a powerful story with deep feelings and raw emotions. Readers looking for a deep story will find this story appealing. This was a F(BR) with my SHHLUT WarFor more reviews/reveals/giveaways visit:  "

This is a hard one to write a review without spoiling, so I took out a lot of my typical fields for this review. Please don't hesitate to pm me if you have any further questions!
Overall Opinion:  This was an enjoyable read. I didn't want to ruin it for myself, so I really had just skimmed through other reviews before jumping in. I hadn't realized that domestic violence had such a huge roll in this book. I didn't mind it at all, but it just wasn't expected. As someone who was in an abusive relationship as a teen, I appreciated the author's insight into the struggle from perspective of both a child witness and a victim domestic violence. She exposed the struggles that go along with loving someone that is abusive, as well as how easily it is for an outsider to judge without experiencing it themselves. So -- no matter my opinion on the book, kudos to Ms. Hoover for that! Now for the not so great...I felt like we didn't get enough closure at all. I feel like we had a bomb dropped in the last chapter right before the epilogue, and we were just given the epilogue to see everyone happy. This is quickly becoming one of my biggest pet peeves, especially because it seems to be happening more and more with authors! I was fully sucked in and committed to these characters, and to have a quick ending like that?!? I feel ripped off! I don't think I'd be as upset if I wasn't invested, so there's that I guess ;)Brief Summary of the Storyline:  I'm keeping this super short to avoid spoilers. This is mainly Lily's story. Lily meets Riley on the night of her father's funeral, and they share some big things with each other with the idea that they'll never see each other again. They are shocked to run into each other again 6 months later, and end up seeing each other. We learn about Lily's childhood and first love through journal enteies, and all of that is brought to life when she unexpectedly bumps into her first love. There are a lot of up and downs in Lily's life, but she does eventually get to a good place and finds a HFN ending.POV: This was told in Lily's POV.Overall Pace of Story:  Good until the end. Otherwise -- it flowed well, I read it fast, and I never skimmed.h rating: 4.5 stars. Lily. I really liked her! I felt for her struggles, and I cheered her on during her times of strength.Sadness level: Moderate. I went into this expecting to sob throughout the whole book. I didn't. Don't get me wrong! I cried. I just didn't cry until the last 15/20ish%, and it never turned into an ugly cry. I know others experienced it differently, so it might just be me *shrugs*.Heat level: Low/moderate. I didn't find the scenes hot, and I don't think they were in there to be hot either.Descriptive sex: Yes, but more about emotional connection rather than physical.Safe sex: Yes. Condoms are mentioned, it I don't remember any mention of past practices.OW/OM drama: Yes (view spoiler)[The h's new love is very jealous when the old love shows up, and it causes a lot of drama.  (hide spoiler)]Cheating: No (view spoiler)[ This is not a traditional love triangle. Even though the h still had feelings for her first love, I felt that she was fully present with her new love and nothing happened between them when she was with him. (hide spoiler)]Possible Triggers: Yes (view spoiler)[ Homelessness, parent abandonment, loss of a parent, and domestic violence (hide spoiler)]Closure:  This didn't have enough closure for me. I think that they are on the right track for a HEA, but I wanted to experience it!! Especially after all the crap they went through to get there!! I guess some others might call it a HEA, but not me! I'd call it a HFN for sure.How I got it: I got it on loan through my public library.Safety: I'd call this one either Safe with exception or Not Safe depending on personal preferences (again -- I didn't want to spoil the book, so PM me if you need further details)(view spoiler)[- Does Not have cheating-  Does  have abuse-  Does Not have OTT sad parts- Does Not have a HEA ending IMO (see above) (hide spoiler)]"

“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”
I’ve read a lot of Colleen Hoover’s books in the past, but I think this one will stick with me for a while. Lily and Ryle’s story has made me feel things that are impossible to put into words! You really need to read this book for yourself to experience the emotional rollercoaster... This made me realize what a lucky person I am, because of the wonderful and loving childhood I had in the past and the amazing boyfriend I have now, who I’m about to move in with and wouldn’t hurt a fly.I’m so conflicted right now though! My feelings are all over the place.I have never hated a character as much as Ryle, even though I loved him to pieces equally as much. Lily was one of the strongest female characters I’ve ever encountered and I’ll never forget about, even though I didn’t always agree with her decisions. I loved that Colleen Hoover decided to write about this topic, but I hate that this actually happens to people.I loved everything about this and the ending was perfect, even though I’d hoped for another outcome."

1839,5.0,"I'm not giving this book 5-stars because I liked it and it made me feel good. I'm doing it because the writing deserves it. The characters come alive and the way complex emotions and situations are explored in this story forces you to feel and it's gut-wrenching. Yeah, it's like this when you are done.I went into this book blind because I read a review that suggested that. I didn't even read the blurb about the story. So, I had no idea where it was heading. But, after reading the blurb now, I think you will still not really know where it is heading unless you read a bunch of reviews. I personally would probably have avoided the book if I knew. It's not that I have any life experience about this subject, it's just that I usually avoid things with too many feels. Not my thing. But, I am glad I read it. Kind of. It was a captivating story.The only thing I would warn people about is that this could be a painful trigger for some people, so if you want to know the subject matter open my spoiler.(view spoiler)[ It is about spousal abuse and explores the mind of a woman who is trying very hard not to repeat the abusive marriage of her parents, but finds herself in love with a man who is becoming increasingly violent towards her.

“You are my world, Lily. My world.”
Nothing…and we mean, nothing…could have prepared us for how this story unfolded. You know a book has affected you when you finish it and sit there numb, unable to even contemplate moving until you’ve processed all the intricacies of the emotional, unforgettable and extraordinary story you’ve been privy to. When, a day later, you catch yourself staring into space thinking about the characters you’ve loved, their situation and their outcome as though you’ve experienced every aspect of the story on some personal level. And then…. struggling to find the words to adequately convey your feelings when all you really want to do is grab every reader and yell, READ this book! When, no matter how emotionally battered you feel, you want readers to experience the pain and courage it took this author to put down her words for us to share.That’s exactly how we feel after reading It Ends With Us. The naked truth? This story wasn’t anything we expected but so much more than we could have asked for. We were left overloaded with emotion at the intensity and direction Colleen Hoover took us in with Lily’s story. This is the Colleen Hoover we love, the lady whose words are like a warm, comforting hug one minute, a kick to the heart the next.
“I love you, Lily. Everything you are. I love you.”
It took guts to write this story because as heartbreaking as it was for us to read it, we can only guess what it took for Colleen Hoover to reach into her heart and bring this book to life. This is an author with the incredible talent to weave a story that left us questioning ourselves, our thoughts and our feelings and with It Ends With Us, Colleen Hoover deserves all the accolades this story will bring.We (fairly or unfairly) placed Colleen Hoover on a pedestal years ago. She’s way up there as far as authors go and we have come to expect the unique and the phenomenal from her. It’s hard not to when she is responsible for books such as: Slammed, Point of Retreat, Hopeless and Maybe Someday. These are the sort of books we treasure and don’t get to experience as often as we’d like.We liked, but didn’t love the last two books we read by Collen. They felt a little ‘safe’ for want of a better word. We know this author, we know what she’s capable of and those two books fell a little short of our expectations, but that’s our opinion and we know others loved them. We were worried our love affair with Colleen’s writing was over and that, readers, would have been a travesty. It Ends With Us has broken that voodoo and we couldn’t be happier…despite having tears streaming down our faces.
“How far would you go, Lily?”“I don’t know.”
Some have told us this is a huge departure for Colleen Hoover but we disagree. This, this is the sort of story we always knew Colleen Hoover would one day deliver. Now we understand the posts we’ve seen from her stating how difficult this book was to write and how much it took out of her because reading it tore us to pieces. We loved these characters with every beat of our hearts so when they hurt, you can bet we hurt too. This one hit us hard. Personally it resonated with us in ways we’d rather it didn’t and would love to forget.Colleen Hoover dug deep for this book and It Ends With Us is testament to how Colleen has grown as an author in the last four years because this story is remarkable, different, honest, heartbreaking and at times agonizing reading. This is not an easy book to get through but by God, it’s rewarding.
“Someone once told me that there is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”
There is so much we’d love to tell you about this book. We’d love to sift through the layers, the complexities, the sheer emotion of the story, but we won’t because the surprise element is what makes this story so palpable and only an author can tell their story. What we will say is that Colleen Hoover sideswiped us big time, many times and that synopsis doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of what you’ll find between the pages of this book. The significance of the title had us in tears.Reliving Lily’s youth was particularly difficult for us both. It was a personal journey we understood implicitly and it hurt to read. We were Lily and that was punishing for us both. In true Colleen fashion, though, she delivers this part of Lily’s story in an imaginatively warm way that had us both tearing up and giggling, our hearts overflowing with warmth as much as dread. Oh how we loved the courageous Lily Bloom. We championed her, we understood her and we felt for her every step of the way from her younger years to present as we lived Lily’s journey.‘Imagine all the people you meet in your life. There are so many. They come in like waves, trickling in and out with the tide. Some waves are much bigger and make more of an impact than others. Sometimes the waves bring with them things from deep in the bottom of the sea and they leave those things tossed onto the shore. Imprints against the grains of sand that prove the waves had once been there, long after the tide recedes.’If you’re a person who shies away from heartbreaking stories or who shuns anything resembling a love triangle (this is not a love triangle) and you allow those feelings prevent you from picking up this book, you’ll be kicking yourselves because this is one of the best reads of this year. We can’t urge you enough to take a step outside of your reading bubble and trust this author to guide you with her beautiful, honest, heartbreaking and raw words. This story demanded to be told, we feel it demands to be read, and as we sit here with tears streaming down our faces, we know we won’t be forgetting this experience any time soon.

1841,3.0,"This book is surprisingly good. This is the first book of Collen Hoover I read. I didn't expect much from this book, I actually had no idea what to expect. This book is not just a random romance rather carries a strong message.  Women around us suffer abuse every day and accept it. It's not okay. I liked Lily, she was strong and brave. The first time Ryle hit her, I was shocked. The second time I was angry, then he brought up the PTSD trauma, I still couldn't forgive him but it made me feel sorry for him. But the last time he almost raped her, I was done with him. I was angry when the first few times she forgave Ryle, but I understand that. It was at the beginning of their relationship and she tried to justify his abuse and most importantly she was confused. However, when she realized Ryle isn't going to change she decided to end things with him. Leaving Ryle is the best thing she did. Atlas is one of my most favorite characters in this book. I wish there was more of him. He really loved Lily and I was shocked how committed he was towards her. The ending felt rushed, I wish it was a bit longer. But I think it's fitting. Lilly got her life together with Atlas and Ryle got to have a good relationship with his daughter after everything he did.I think Lily moved to Boston for Atlas because she knew he will be there. It was clear she loved Atlas from the beginning. When Lilly got to know Atlas lied to her about having a girlfriend because he was jealous and she realized if Atlas told her the truth, she would have chosen him over Ryle without a second thought, I immediately wanted them together.I really liked Ryle at the beginning. Their meeting was cute. But when he started being abusive I realized monsters hide under masks. For me Ryle wasn't a bad person, he just couldn't control his emotion. But does it justify what he did to Lily? No. Miscommunication and lack of communication are a big part of this novel.   Instead of jumping into conclusion if Ryle would talk to Lily lots of problems would have solved. He has no right to hit lily just because he thinks she is cheating. I wanted to see more of Lily and Atlas together. They both suffered a lot. Their love was young and pure. I knew Lily would choose Atlas at the end and I was delighted for them. They had their future planed in Boston and they finally were able to fulfill it. I liked how patient Atlas was for Lily. Overall, it was an emotional read, had a great message about  relationships, abuse, how people judge others without knowing the circumstances  and I enjoyed it."
1842,4.0,"4.5 stars!Check out my full review here : https://rachaelrexds.wordpress.com/20...( Trigger Warning : Book deals with topics such as domestic abuse and rape )It Ends With Us may be a new adult contemporary novel, but it was a very dark novel. Reading this book was very difficult because it dealt with heavy topics that I was not expecting and it was also a very heart wrenching novel. It was still a very important read and it's probably one of the most powerful novels I've read in 2016.“All humans make mistakes. What determines a person's character aren't the mistakes we make. It's how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.”It Ends With Us dealt with heavy topics such rape and abuse and I felt that the author handled both topics very well. Yes, this is a fictional book but the situations that some of the characters were put through are situations that people still face in society nowadays. Reading the scenes with the abuse were very difficult to get through. I couldn't relate to it but it just felt real. I felt actual fear for the characters that were experiencing it and I don't think I can ever forget it. Colleen was very brave in stepping out and writing this novel that opened the eyes of many.Though it was a very emotional and dark read, it was also very hopeful. It Ends With Us showed us that sometimes we just need to gather all our courage and leave situations that are unhealthy or hurtful because our happiness and well-being is always the most important thing. It teaches us to "" just keep swimming "" and to never lose hope. I would highly recommend it to everyone as it is just such a wonderful and important read!"
1843,5.0,This made me cry more than any book has before.
1844,5.0,"Initial reaction: I am dead. Bury me somewhere pretty.Review:I am currently a mess of emotions, thoughts and feelings. This was such a difficult, heartbreaking and emotional book. I knew Colleen had said that this was her most personal and difficult book to write, but I never expected the roller-coaster that I got. This is why it’s so incredibly hard to write a proper review. It’s a book that it’s easy to love, but it’s easier to hate. Not because it’s badly written, but because it presents a sad reality that is incredibly accurate for a lot of people. I’m being cryptic for a reason, I’m trying very hard to avoid spoiling anything. But I can tell you that it’s probably Colleen’s best book to date. It’s not my favourite book of hers (that honour still remains to Maybe Someday), but it most definitely is her best book.  Lily hasn’t always had it easy, but that’s never stopped her from working hard for the life she wants. She’s come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up - she graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything in Lily’s life suddenly seems almost too good to be true.Ryle is assertive, stubborn, and maybe even a little arrogant. He’s also sensitive, brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily, but Ryle’s complete aversion to relationships is disturbing.As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan - her first love and a link to the past she left behind. He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.The most important thing about this book is its message. Which is why it’s very, very important to read it until the end and see the big picture. Because the moment when you realise what the title actually means… you’ll be on the floor, sobbing. It’s a very heavy book and you should know that going into it. If you’re expecting a fluffy romance, you should know by now that Colleen doesn’t do fluffy. She does “let-me-punch-you-in-your-heart-and-you’ll-thank-me-for-it”. She does “let-me-rip-you-apart”. And she hasn’t done it quite like this before. The next important thing about this book is the characters. Which are very well portrayed by these quotes:  “There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.” “All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.”  You’ll feel very conflicting feelings about these characters (except for Alyssa. Alyssa is bae. I wish, with all my heart, that I had an Alyssa in my life). But you’ll be incredibly proud of all of them. Going into this book, be prepared to learn. And reevaluate some notions and principles. And realise that things are never strictly black and white. There are always, always shades of grey. It’s very easy to judge someone, judge their situation when looking from the outside in. But living that person’s life is something altogether different and eye-opening. It’s a book about love. Sacrifice. Salvation. Friendship. Presumption and reality. Family. Love, love, love. It’s a book about life. Read it.*trigger warning for abuseFavourite quotes:“He pulls back to look down at me and when he sees my tears, he brings his hands up to my cheeks. “In the future… if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again… fall in love with me.” “Just because someone hurts you doesn’t mean you can simply stop loving them. It’s not a person’s actions that hurt the most. It’s the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.” “Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen.” ★★★★★ To everyone who got this far, thank you for reading and have a wonderful day! Also, feel free to share your thoughts, comment or tell me anything :)"
1845,5.0,"Naked truth?... I'm always a little overwhelmed and apprehensive when it come's to reviewing a Colleen Hoover book. I always feel like I can't put into words exactly how much her books mean to me. The impact they have. The way she writes is so personal. Her words slay me.  There is no such thing as bad people. We're all just people who sometimes do bad things. Firstly, It's really quite hard to review this book without giving anything away. That synopsis in no way prepares you for what you're going to experience when you open this book. Just know that your emotions are going to get the greatest workout ever. But it's more than worth every second of it, because what you're going to read is so impactful. When Lily Bloom and Ryle Kincaid meet, they expect their brief encounter to be the end of it. Ryle is only looking for a one night stand. A girlfriend and marriage are not in his future. Lily wants the exact opposite. She doesn't do one night stands. She's looking for the happily ever after. And so they go their separate ways. But they can't seem to forget about each other. And just when Lily is contemplating giving in and enjoying one night with Ryle, he decides he want's to give a relationship with Lily a go. Could things be more perfect? Just when Lily is asking herself that exact question, Atlas Corrigan appears. He was Lily's first love. All those old feelings she had for him are there, just below the surface. Will Atlas's reappearance threaten what Lily and Ryle are just starting to build? Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. And then...I'm broken.My heart is on the floor at my feet. It's in a million shattered pieces.  Fifteen seconds. That's all it takes to completely change everything about a person. I'd heard a few people say that this is Colleen Hoover's best work. Personally I was a little skeptical. How could it be better than all her other work? Ha! Wasn't I about to eat my words, because this is hands down Colleen Hoover's greatest work to date. It's bold. It's honest. It's brave. It's raw. It's in your face. It's courage. It's strength. It's a must read!********A copy of It Ends With Us was provided by the publisher for my honest review."
1846,5.0,"Wow, I don’t think I could write a review that would do this book justice. I was expecting the possibility of a run-of-the-mill romance novel (since that was the section it was in at the bookstore), but this is SO much more. It is about love, but it’s also about breaking the cycle of abuse. It’s about making hard choices when you just want to take the “easy” way. My goodness… this is definitely one of my top books of the year. What I loved most about this book is that I really loved the main character, Lily. She’s caring, thoughtful, creative, ambitious, level headed (mostly), and has a lot of self-awareness and self-respect that is highlighted throughout this book. I laughed and cried, and felt moved on many occasions. Well done, Colleen Hoover. "
1847,5.0,"Holy fuck. I am at a loss for words. This book was a tall glass of vodka, and I'm completely hungover. Now this isn't my full and final review, but I want to share my thoughts. From the very first chapter, I knew I was going to love this book. I loved it till the very last page in the Acknowledgments. I knew Colleen could write; I love ALL of her books. But she took this book to a whole new level. Words cannot express my love for this book. It's a beautiful heartbreak. It's empowering. It's honest. It's the naked truth. I encourage everyone to read this book when it comes out. Because DAMN, that was the best book I have had the pleasure to read in a while. You want the naked truth? This is by far, my favorite Colleen Hoover book. "

“Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back.""
~Okay, let's get started, I know that if I don't review this book now, I never will.~First, you need to know that before this book I was in a HUGE reading slump and that I read this book in one night (it's been several years that I haven't done that, quit sleeping to read) so I apology in advance for the spoilers and the mumbling, because this book takes writing to a whole new level>> Do you feel it? The excruciating pain of wanting to make the wrong choice? Was any of the choice good after all?<<This book is my second Colleen Hoover, and yet I can feel something different about it. I can feel that this story is written with guts and not only mind. I knew from the very first pages that this story HAS to mean something to CoHo. This is only at the end when I'm agonizing on the cool hard ground that I realize just how much of her is lying in this book. Her final note was probably what broke me the most. I've witnessed (view spoiler)[domestic violence (hide spoiler)] in my life, but I've never actually lived it on a daily basis. I never truly comprehend it. Until now.
“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”
I think that you should read this book without any clue of what it is about, but if you still want some clue, I would tell you that this book is about love, about what a person can or cannot endure out of love and what she/he chooses (or doesn't choose, that's the point) to let herself/himself endure. This book is about (view spoiler)[abuse and domestic violence (hide spoiler)] and the ripples effect it has on one's life but not only. And it also is about how I realized that even if I claim to be an open-minded person, I was judgmental toward them. I always thought (view spoiler)[
  ""why is she not leaving him?"" ""if she staying that means that she is putting it on herself"" ""we are strong, we can face them, press charge, take our suitcase and leave without a look back""
(hide spoiler)]. This book proved me wrong. This book shattered me.So yes, this book left me depressed, thinking about this story pains me in my soul but it also helped me discover a new part of myself, it allowed my heart to more understanding than it used to be toward others and also toward myself. Spoilers below this pointChoice. To me, this book, as life in general, is all about choices. How do I make the right decision? Is there a ""good"" option or will they both be the end of me? I know that whatever the choice is, I will be hurt, I will suffer, but which one is the best of them in the long run?Those are the question that the main character, Lily, has been asking herself (and I asked them to me as well). And I felt so implicated in her story and her choice(s), and even after this book I still want her to make what would have probably been the worst choice in the long run. She loved Ryle. I loved Ryle as well. I loved them both together. And I wanted love to be enough. I needed love to be enough. And even after this book, I still want to believe that love can be enough. I wanted him to have one more chance. I would have given him one more chance (and how many after that?) I was in the vicious circle of abuse and I was making the choice I promised myself I would never do. I was enduring two failures at the same time: his and mine. He didn't keep his words, and I didn't keep mine. NAKED TRUTH? No matter how I always claimed to be the one who would leave, I wanted to stay for him.
“Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.” 
Lily and Ryle's relationship was so true, so well written, so layered. The same way the book is. This book is not black nor white, the characters are not good nor bad. This is what makes this book so powerful, it was actual reality. I related to it. I will never forget the pain I feel while thinking about Ryle, I still can visualize the pain in his eyes. I liked Atlas very much, I felt him like an old tree, here even when he is not, reliable, home, and I liked that at the end he was part of Lily's equation. Atlas is part of the reason why I admired Lily so much, he is a part of her, of her past and of who she is and why she became the way she is. She is BRAVE and BOLD, she is a role model for any women struggling and she is now part of my favourite heroines ever.
“In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.”

Naked Truth:
 I went into this book blind and had to work really hard to keep my eyes averted from any updates and/or reviews but here's the thing....if you're sensitive to certain harsh aspects of some relationships then you definitely need to check out some reviews before reading. Many people have been touched by these types of situations... in some way and it's not pretty. And even though it's a fictional story with some events based on true life, it was unsettling especially if you're not prepared. 
Naked Truth:
 So contrary to my first paragraph, I am going to be purposely vague. You probably won't understand the rest of the review unless you've read the book. 
Naked Truth:
 I hated that Coho made us like both Atlas and Ryle...it just wasn't fair. (And what kind of name is Ryle? Still not sure if I like it!) 
Naked Truth:
 I also hated that Lily kept the truth from Ryle about things that weren't really a big deal but got turned into a HUGE deal. 
Naked Truth:
 After the first ""incident"", why wasn't there better ~or~ more help? People don't get magically fixed no matter how much they want it.
Naked Truth:
 I liked the ending but I liked the beginning too...and the middle. I just wish I was more prepared for the ""incidents"". And I really liked the book's message...."

“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”
One thing I’ve always thought about writing books is that it’s not incredibly hard to make your reader feel sad, or happy. Even angry. But making your reader experience frustration, indecision, even a little bit of confusion? I’ve always felt like that is so much harder to accomplish. That being said, it's worth it, because if done correctly, it can make a reader empathize with any story, no matter how different it may be from their reality. And that just hits you harder than anything else ever will. 
⇢Vibes
This book was the pinnacle of those hard-to-accomplish emotions. I can’t even begin to describe how conflicted I was about so many elements of the main character Lily’s life. (You’ll get this if you read the book, I can’t say much without spoiling.) Romance, business, friendship. She had so many choices to make, and I think her journey was a fantastic demonstration of the difficult paths that many people are forced to take in life. And I feel like that’s something I can say about all of CoHo’s books; they are real, before anything else. 
“Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen.”

⇢The Plot/Emotions
Because you see, at this point I’ve read a plethora of books that discuss serious topics like abuse and toxicity in relationships. I know with books that are meant to be unrealistically “dark” the lines are often blurred, so I’m not taking about those. I mean the serious books. I’ve read lots of them. However, I don’t think I’ve ever read one that captured the struggle of escaping abusive relationships in astounding detail like this one did. I obviously cannot speak from firsthand experience and am simply using secondhand knowledge to form my opinions, but I can wholeheartedly say that I have never felt so close to feeling the extent of how hard it is to make the choice to leave someone you love even when they mistreat you as I did with this book. Because believe me, I felt it. Again, this is already in spoiler-y territory so I can’t say more, but wow. 
“Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”
 
⇢Timelines
I hate to change topics but I need to say that this book was so captivating. You know how when books switch between the past and present it can at times get confusing and maybe even boring? And you start to wait for the better point of view to come back because you dislike one of the timelines? Well, I never felt that was about the dual storylines in this book. Each and every time Lily went back and read one of her letters, I was immediately transported into whatever was going on in young Lily’s life, and I just had to mention that because it’s so rare that an author can accomplish it. 
⇢Romance
Finally, I need to talk about romance because so many people say this is a story about love. I would have to disagree, but it was of course still so important to the story so I want to say what I think of the ending. Warning: spoilers.  So ultimately Lily left her abusive husband Ryle, and it obviously wasn’t easy for her to do so. Eventually, she found her way back to Atlas, who I definitely wish we saw more of in the present timeline. His whole character could have appeared more, I think. But back to Lily, she did return to Atlas and well, we don’t know much more. It basically only happened in the epilogue, and I was a bit annoyed at first because I expected to see more into Lily’s future with him. But then I thought about it, and I was kinda happy. I’m glad that this book was so much more than a romance novel (not that there’s anything wrong with romance books ofc), and I’m glad that the way things ended made no move to make it to one after such a long journey. It was therefore the only ending that actually would have been satisfying. I'm not against an update from CoHo though. I WANNA KNOW HOW THEY ARE!
“He pulls back to look down at me and when he sees my tears, he brings his hands up to my cheeks. “In the future... if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again... fall in love with me.”

⇢Rating
To finish this off, full disclosure, I was planning on rating this four stars before reading the author’s note. I know, I know, how could an author’s note possibly add an entire star onto my rating? Read it, and you’ll understand. That’s all I have to say :)

Sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all that certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide.

It will never stop being a truly indescribable thrill for me to open a new Colleen Hoover book. An author who, time and time again, keeps delivering unforgettable tales of human resilience and determination, Ms Hoover never stops breaking creative new ground with her stories, and this book is perhaps her boldest one of them all. This is a story of survival, a story of sacrifice, a story about the legacies we are born into and the ones we choose to perpetuate—but most of all, this is a story about a young woman bravely forging her own path in life, and the many devastating lessons she is forced to learn along the way. As we delve into some of the darkest corners of all that love entails, we are also taken onto an unexpected journey of self-inquiry, exploring the limits of our own capacity for compassion, acceptance, forgiveness—all the while steered forward by the creative genius of an author who draws us in with the sheer intelligence of her every word, and then forever marks our souls with the profound messages she leaves behind.

1855,5.0,"Hi yeah so I’m curled on my floor because my heart has been absolutely destroyed...This Colleen Hoover book is by far the one that caused the most tears. I was essentially the wreck the entire second half of the book and couldn’t get my shit together (just ask my friends I was texting while reading this thing) In my opinion, this is also Colleen Hoover’s strongest novel. It deals with a topic that is both close to my heart and many others She wrote a story about realistic human beings and yes... the characters made mistakes and got into situations that weren’t the best... but that was the entire point in my opinion. Situations like those that are portrayed in this book actually happen and to see it play out it such a raw way was simply incredible.My emotions were all over the place so, if you pick up this book, be prepared for emotional trauma. It’s absolutely beautiful and I sincerely hope people will read this and stop saying terrible things about Colleen Hoover as a romance author.That’s all I can handle tonight folks... hopefully this forced me out of my reading slump (: Oh and also Maybe Someday is still my personal fav because I related to it a little bit more but I think IEWU is now my second favorite because MY EMOTIONS "

Life is a funny thing. we only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on thing that might happen someday, or maybe even never.
No sé si es el mejor libro de Colleen Hoover, pero no es mi favorito, porque sé que no lo volvería a leer, al menos no en un tiempo cercano, por el momento creo que fue suficiente.Este libro fue un duro golpe de realidad te dice HEY HEY WAKE UP !  TODAS LAS MUJERES DEBERÍAN DE LEER ESTE LIBRO EN ALGÚN MOMENTO DE SU VIDAMe dejó una gran gran reflexión y tal vez cambió un poco mi manera de pensar porque no juzgaría de la misma manera. Tienen una temática muy fuerte y controversial que es la violencia intrafamiliar¿Cuántas veces no hemos juzgado a una mujer que es maltratada? Por mi parte muchas veces y decimos si yo fuera ella haría esto si yo fue ella haría lo otro, porque no lo deja que lo denuncie, siii que fácil, tal vez para nosotros sí, ¿ Pero te has preguntado la situación y la circunstancias que las rodean y que están viviendo en pocas palabra ponerte en sus zapatos? pues en este libro vamos a ver diferentes ángulos de una situación de violencia y no solo eso si no dos entornos de violencia.
There is not such thing as bad people. we're all just people who sometimes do bad things
ESte libro narra la vida de Lilly nuestra protagonista en dos etapas de su vida 1. Adolescencia donde vive el maltrato de su padre hacia su mamá y como ella justifica aguanta y cubre sus agresiones, haciendo que Lilly se pregunte una y mil veces porque su mamá no lo deja. y conoce a su primer amor Atlas 2. Vida adulta, aquí conoce a Ryle un neurocirujano bad boy con quien tiene un intalove y solo él quiere una one night stand oh que original que con el tiempo tiene una relación sexosa hasta cierto punto bonita.Hay tres situaciones que marcan está bonita historia de amor de Ryle y Lilly- La primera agresión y aquí es donde CoHo se metió en mi cabeza porque hasta cierto punto lo jusfiqué y sí ella LO PERDONA y de verdad Ryle la ama. - La segunda agresión un arranque de ira y celos de él,¿ Cómo se puede perdonar dos agresiones? Maldita Colleen por la razón de los arranques de ira de Ryle, también yo lo hubiera perdonado y tratado de ayudar, así es el amor.-La tercera agresión ...Vemos dos situaciones de violencia muy distintas una donde la el papá es un sádico que maltrata agrede a su mamá y es alcohólico. Y la segunda donde ellos se aman pero él tiene arranques de ira que empaña toda su bonita relación. Pero al fin violencia es violencia y NADIE tiene derecho a ponernos una mano encima aunque hayamos hecho algo malo, ni a humillarnos ni subajarnos.
It takes an astronomical amount of pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern. Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiar circles, rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet.
Tenemos que saber donde están y definir nuestros límites que tanto vamos a soportar, porque no sólo te lastiman a tí también a tus hijos; esa reflexión me encantó. Y otra cosa el amor no lo puede todo tu no puedes ayudar a cambiar tu pareja, tal vez apoyarlo y saber hasta que punto decir HASTA AQUÍ.Naked Truth Tal vez estuviera más en conflicto respecto a Ryle pero Colleen tuvo que meter a Atlas casi Perfecto y se robó mi corazón fue el personaje más bonito de toda la historia y Ryle nunca pudo competir con él. Sorry not sorryAllysa y Marshall quiero un libro de ellos aunque sea un relato corto de su historia está pareja es tan genialPS: Nunca leo las notas de los autores o los agradecimientos y ahora que lo acabo de leer después de 3 semanas de haber finalizado el libro puedo decir que mis pensamientos no cambian y ahora admiro a las personas que han pasado por esta situación y han salido adelante por ejemplo mi abuela que es la persona más positiva que conozco o mi mamá aunque no pasó por una situación similar si una donde su matrimonio no daba para más pero que jamás nos involucró a sus hijos en sus problemas de pareja . Así que mami y abue aunque no van a leer esto de todas maneras lo voy a escribir LAS QUIERO Y ADMIRO MUCHO MÁS."
1858,4.0,"I have finished a 300+ pages book in less than 12 hours!!! 😶😶 What in Earth 😶😶And that's not even me that was Co-Ho's writing ❤ Colleen Hoover 🙏 wow girl wowOkay updating and upgrading my review because I think this baby deserves everyone's attention and more limelight Also every human Being especially girls should read it ❤I am not going to write any Traditional reviewbecause I am way too much emotionally raw to do that. I'll do some Rambling, mindless rambling to be more specific and deliver my perspectiveAnd Don't you dare to read my review if you haven’t read the book yet 😒 GO READ THE BOOK then come back  ❌❌❌❌❌❌Heart Break Alert❌❌❌❌❌❌❌ ..(view spoiler)[Okay It's time to take out some of the bitterness about the fictional characters Whole time I was reading the book I felt a weird Knot in my stomach, I felt nauseous and I was constantly in verge of tears out of anger, out of disgust or out of pity? I can't point out one particular emotionFinally I could cry when the hospital's part came in the end ❤Also Atlas thank u for the happy tears you gave me by baking cookies, giving her the heart, thank u for Loving her angel..You can't justify violence 😊You can't justify abuse 😊..Loved the Ending It was the best part about itWhen you just finished reading about Dean Holder and Gabriel Emerson is constantly on your mind then it is even more harder to digest someone like Ryle, First time he hit YOU ( Lilly) it was an accident Okay fair enough, the second time he was in denial that he even physically hurt you, he technically hide his brother's stroy I feel like in hopes of emotionally fool Lilly 🙂 Yes my heart is with him for his brother's death, but as I said earlier there is no justification for violence in my Dictionary  and the thrid time he almost Raped you, I am not even going to talk about the stitches you got or the injuries, Why? Becausethe mental injuries is much more deeper than the physical ones 🙂the person with who you should feel protected and safe is hurting you.. Why any sensible woman would put up with that?(Especially someone who have seen her mother going Through same shit) ..I know you Weren't Honest with him you SHOULD have done things differentlyBut part of me exactly knows Ryle would have found another excuse to beat you, abuse you or harass you  After Chapter 25 I Didn't even want to read his name 🙂 Okay so many things are currently on my mind I know I am going to start blabbering more but I need to get this out of my system because just like Lilly I also have the habit of writing my heart out So here it goes:..Here's what things I would have done differently 1. I would have waited for Atlas, he clearly asked for four years, If you claim that you love someone so much then you couldn’t wait untill you got out of College??? Since when did a women's physical needs got bigger than her soul's need?2. I would try to find Atlas myself and God sent you himself in the restaurant and things haven’t even started with you and Ryle, You literally played with two men, you know that? You couldn’t give yourself totally to one man?? You proved that Ryle was right to be insecured, If I think that way his doubt wasn’t meaningless You even admitted while being in the marrige you loved Atlas Actually Lilly why your IQ level is so low???Only sensible thing she has done in her life was DIVORCING RYLE3.First time he hit you even if it was an accident which I think accident Doesn't happen 100% unconsciously You saw the sign, Yes u gave him one chance I would have done that too...why your second chance become thrid one?? Okay, in the End I just want to conclude it with this certain hypocritic statement that You Don't deserve Atlas 😊Somehow you ended up with him the Angel himself because u are extremely fortunate Don't fuck up with him Also Lilly thanks for being Bold at the End Because God knows I would've lost my God damn mind if you hadn’t divorced that hideous psychopath. (hide spoiler)]I just want to say It ends with us taught me How to be BoldAnd it made me realise Not Everyone Deserves a Second Chance "
1859,4.0,"This book will linger...It's an ironic title, ""It Ends With Us."" Its fancier than ironic; its incongruous, a paradox. This story will do anything but end. This book will linger. It's like tiny grains of sand you find in random places weeks after you return from the beach. It's a thought you have as soon as you wake up, but aren't even aware you're having it. And then once you realize it, everything comes crashing down. It will linger leaving an aftertaste of hurt, confusion, happiness, sadness. You'll want so badly to be happy. You should be happy. You're suppose to be happy. The ending was happy. It was. Right? It was ambivalent. From the very first scene at the restaurant, I knew where this story was headed, and I was scared. I was terrified. Some people have anticipatory anxiety. I had anticipatory emotions. However, what I didn't expect was the link created between my emotions and that of the victim. I didn't want to see the ugly truth. Even in this moment, my heart still clinches so tightly to the good, the excuses echoing in the back of my mind. It brought me to a level of understanding that I never wanted to experience. I wasn't just a reader looking in, I was caught right in the middle of wanting something that I knew I shouldn't. Those wants still haunt me, the ""buts"" the ""what ifs."" I'm weaker than Lily because I still haven't let it go. It's like being caught in a storm of desperate rationalization. Part of me wishes I could have been more invested in the relationship between Lily and Atlas; there was so much depth to this story that could have been explored. I honestly feel they needed an entire book just to develop their foundation. It was difficult not being able to experience their story first hand. I think maybe that's why I was able to invest so much more into Lily and Ryle. Or maybe this was just how things were suppose to be. Maybe this is why it's so painful. So real.I wouldn't call this book a love triangle, but two relationships paralleling each other. The names of the characters were a little distracting at first, but are overshadowed later by an emotionally poignant love story. Two different types of love stories. Love in a way you haven't experienced before.This book pulled me out of my comfort zone, and won't easily be forgotten. READ ON!!More reviews at: http://www.toughcriticbookreviews.blo..."
1860,5.0,"Eu não tenho PALAVRAS pra explicar a sensação ao terminar esse livro. Esse é definitivamente o melhor livro da Colleen Hoover que eu já li (4 lidos agora, vicío total). E o mais bizarro é que eu chorei mais lendo a nota da autora no final do que com a própria história. Que sensacional, gente.Eu sei que muita gente tem preconceito com Colleen Hoover porque ela escreve romance, porque são new adult e porque tem sexo, mas se eu já desconfiava o quanto ela é uma autora incrível pelos outros 4 livros que eu tinha lido, nesse eu passei a ter completa certeza e nunca mais vou sentir que gostar de Colleen Hoover é guilty pleasure. NÃO ME SINTO CULPADO, a mulher samba! Esse é um livro forte sobre relacionamento abusivo que todo mundo precisa ler. Homens, mulheres e principalmente adolescentes. Essa mulher sabe criar situações incrivelmente realistas. Cada detalhe das cenas, nos gestos, nas descrições, são tão nitidamente reais que diversas vezes eu esquecia que era um livro (ouvi em audiobook) e ficava realmente preocupado com a personagem. Uma das minhas leituras favoritas de 2016, sem dúvida. 43 estrelas."
1861,5.0,"Creía que era imposible superar otras historias que había leído de la autora, pero es que esta historia es absolutamente perfecta.Desde el primer momento ya me había enamorado de sus personajes, Lily es maravillosa desde el minuto uno, pero es que todos los personajes son increíbles. Cada uno de los personajes hacen que la historia haya sido perfecta, porque la trama, por mucho que leas la sinopsis, cosa que no recomiendo para que os sorprendáis más, es totalmente IMPREDECIBLE. Ha dolido leer durante muchos momentos, ha dolido pero ha sido bonito al terminarlo. No puedo decir más sobre esto. Pero este libro me ha hecho sentir cosas, cosas muy fuertes en mi corazón, rabia, dolor, risas, esperanza... y será una historia que quedará anclada a mi, y que recomendaría leer a todo el mundo, porque no es una historia más. Es algo más. Tuve miedo a que me decepcionara, tuve miedo que no tuviera el final que quería, pero fue perfecto, fue totalmente lo que necesitaba esta historia. Jo, no tengo palabras. Si tenéis un nivel de inglés que os permita leer, leed este libro tan maravilloso. No os arrepentiréis. "

1863,5.0,La note de CoHo à la fin le rend encore plus émouvant...
1864,5.0,"I know I'm going to cry a lot when I read a CoHo book. But it still manages to shock me how attached I become to the story and her characters. 
It’s not a person’s actions that hurt the most. It’s the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.
Lily had a hard childhood, growing up with a father who beat her mom on a regular basis. So when he dies, she doesn't feel that much sadness to see him go. On the day of his funeral, just after she gives the world's worst eulogy she meets a stranger on a rooftop. Ryle and Lily have an interesting conversation about life and their ambitions. But they both want different things in life and part thinking that they'd never see eachother again. They do. And the sparks they had that night many months ago are still there. Ryle and Lily are great together. I loved Ryle. But once Lily starts reading diaries about her past featuring Atlas her first love, my allegiances switched. I love me a good love triangle and this one was great! I feel like this book really dealt with the subject of physical abuse in a relationship so well. It felt real and convincing and it had me thinking about what women in those situations have to go through and how strong they are to put up with that kind of shit. Colleen Hoover blows me away everytime, but this is for sure one of her best ones. WARNING: physical abuse, attempted rape"
1865,5.0,Sometimes it is the one who loves you who hurts you the most.Naked truth?I have now words...It was bloody... The end.
1866,5.0,"“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”Well, this is going to be short and sweet because there's really not a whole lot I can talk about. I want to start with the fact that I didn't cry. Which might actually be a first for me because I'm assuming people placed bets behind my back about how much I would cry. Suckers, you all lost. This is extremely emotional. It's personal. It's hard. At first your not exactly sure how to deal with it, and then things get complicated, and even more emotional, personal, and hard. I understand and agree with everyone Colleen did and her need to tell this story. It may not have been something I'd choose to read generally if I knew the entire context, but it's important. I had that a lot while reading, the feeling of importance. That what I was reading meant something, that this could possibly change something for someone. It's deep and poetic without being pretentious or forced. Hoover's work just flows constantly. I finished this book last night and am editing this review eight hours later, so my feelings have had time to settle a little. I need to reiterate again how I understand how and why Colleen did what she did and how she stuck to the characters even when she didn't want to. With this being said, the first 60% of the book or so, I loved. I agreed with every second. The development, the scenes, the relationship, the angst, Lily recalling her first love as a teenager through journal entries, everything. But after this point the story started to shift and get into the nitty gritty. I know character changes can be confusing. Even in real life, you don't expect it. But this was so hard to grasp for me. I felt for Lily so hard because I've been through a *slightly similar* but way less intense version of one of these moments with a friend. I know how it can affect you. I know how you see that person afterwards and the excuses you have. I get it. But that doesn't make me any more comfortable reading about it. Even this morning, I'm not sure exactly what it is but I'm uncomfortable about something. I can't put my finger in it and I'm not sure if I even want to try. I know a good writer will make you feel everything they want you to feel, but it seems that everyone finished this story with hearts (and tears!) in their eyes and a renewed love for the story, but I didn't. I guess I the odd ball out here. I love Colleen, I always will, but this one is sitting with me differently than everyone else. I guess what I'm trying to get across is that, it's okay to feel different than other readers do. Your perception and past experiences will dictate that, but I'm also going to stand firm and say that this story will cause a reaction. Some will be good, some will be bad. I guarantee you some people will not like this book and others will love it. It's all in your perception. But whether you love it or hate it, it will always be important. Everyone, and I do mean everyone, needs to read this. This is not a book for your entertainment. This will challenge you, make you think, make you evaluate and really look at those around you. How you trust others, support others, understand others. All important values and traits that we as humans need to work on expressing more and judging less.I can't really say anything more other than go into this completely blind. I don't want to talk about characters or plot, so I can do is tell you how it made me feel. Enjoy folks! Side note, some people are saying this is a triangle and they won't read it because of such. This is NOT a love triangle. Get it together, everyone! 5 Stars for CoHo's It Ends With Us. JOIN THE SISTERHOOD! FIND US ON: FACEBOOK / INSTAGRAM / TWITTER / WEBSITE"
1867,5.0,"Can I just start by telling you it takes me much longer to read a book by Colleen Hoover than others because I deliberately slow down so I don't miss a single solitary word she has written so I can be completely absorbed in every moment right along with the characters and I deliciously savor each word!Every book Colleen has written, I have read and thoroughly enjoyed each and everyone. They all left me paralyzed in some state or fashion for awhile because I was totally blown away by what I just read and experienced. This one nearly brought me to my knees!So, I was barely through the first chapter of ""It Ends With Us"" and yes, honest to God, I started reading even slower. I swear, it was like having an out of body experience. Lily Bloom and Ryle Kincaid's storylines, as individuals, as well as a developing twosome, gripped ahold of me immediately and pretty much hog tied me to the couch. Nothing seemed to matter for hours, except what was going on in the lives of these two compelling individuals, and what 'Naked Truths' they were going to share next. Then for good measure, Atlas Corrigan's character was weaved deep into the mix of this story, and my heart and stomach took turns doing somersaults. Have Mercy!!!Just prepare yourself, because your emotions will run the gamut while reading this extremely poignant, realistic, gut wrenching novel. If it were up to me, every high school's English reading curriculum would include this book. Please add this one to your ""want to read"" list and share with all your girlfriends. 5++++++ stars!!!"
1868,4.0,"4.25 StarsI wanted to love this story. I had very high expectations, but this wasn't my favorite Colleen story. Don't get me wrong, it was well done... I just never fully connected with Lily and found certain aspects of the story a bit underdeveloped - like I needed more, of what I'm not sure. I just felt like something was missing.. And to be completely honest, it was kind of depressing, but I couldn't put it down either.Perhaps it's because some stuff hit a little close - my father experienced a similar event as a child, so I was a bit more empathetic towards Ryle and struggled with certain characterizations... I still have so many mixed feelings..Regardless, It Ends with Us provides an interesting take on some heavy issues - it was an extremely thought provoking and emotional read."

WOW! Just... WOW. That was by far Colleen Hoover's best book yet!!! I LOVED IT!!! Seriously, I have no words. Brilliant story. And well written. I don't even want to review it, I could never do it justice without being very spoilery. My advice... go in blind. Don't read the synopsis, don't read reviews. Just read the book. I'd give it more stars if I could. Enough said. "
1870,4.0,"Concept: 4.0/5.0Execution: 3.5/5.0 (*I think I am literally rigid one to be pleased when it comes down to love stories.)Characters Bespoken: 4.5/5.0Cover: 4.75/5.0Feels: This one? I don’t know where to start from. Pinning down all the unfathomable feels I am having right now can’t be absorbed by just mere phrases. I was longing for such love story for a long time; by the time I ended it, a bit of faith restored few love stories could be the most hauntingly beautiful ones.When two different perceptions collide there are possibilities as: in the beginning of love or end of the attraction. And if they combine, it becomes - It ends with us.Okay! No more smudgy eyeliners I am getting to the storyline: Lily Bloom: I loved her for her decisive personalized version. At such turning points of life, no choices could have been best as she took. 
“Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.”
Atlas Corrigan: I wish I had someone in life who would love me just like him. *sighs* Not possible! But, he was the strongest pillar Lily could lean upon anytime. 
“In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.”
Ryle Kincaid: At points, I prayed he will save himself and his family from the cyclone that arose due to his wrath. 
“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”
Allysa and Marshall - cutest couple. Disclaimers: The abusive part which literally boiled my blood. (**Thanks to that paagol insaan whose voice calmed me down.) The moment I started hating Ryle, but still understanding him at points frustrated me as hell. (view spoiler)[ Ryle could have taken anger management classes solved the case, taken the therapy and Lily would have even supported him. Instead, she was hell-bent on him and ultimately she left!

"
1874,5.0,"I just finished this book and I am sitting here a blubbering mess. My eyes are red, my nose is snotty, and I still want to cry. Ms. Hoover broke me through this story. I was unable to look away, even when it was very hard to read. “There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”This story is broken into two parts, and each part gave me so many emotions. First, there was Atlas. 
“You have to stop being so perfect,” I told him. “You’re already my favorite person but now you’re making it really unfair to all the other humans because no one will ever be able to catch up to you.”
I adored Atlas. I loved that we got to learn about him through Lily’s journals. Even when the entries were hard to read, I loved the glimpses of the compassionate man Atlas was. Then, we meet Ryles. “Oh, I want you, Lily. Make no mistake about that. I just don’t want to want you.” Again, I fell in love with Ryles, the sexy, cocky, funny, sweet neurosurgeon.Ms. Hoover sure knows how to write some swoon-worthy men. But then… the unexpected happened and I was broken. “I think about how sometimes, no matter how convinced you are that your life will turn out a certain way, all the certainty can be washed away with a simple change in tide.”I don’t want to spoil any parts of this story. Know that once you start it, you will not be able to put it down. Know that you will need a box of tissues to make it through this story. Know that you will never be the same after you read it. And know that you must always keep swimming. ~ Tiffany, 5+ stars~~~ If you ever wondered why CoHo has a cult-like following, read It Ends with Us. I Confess, Maybe Someday was my first Colleen Hoover book. I went into it blind and This Girl saw the light. November 9 was the next one on my list, and I believed—after my heart Slammed into my chest—that it would be my favorite. And then, I read It Ends with Us. Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we’ll never get back. Ms. Hoover puts her heart and soul into her books, Never Never, Losing Hope that the words on the page are the story she needs to tell. I’m so thankful to her for reminding me that, even in the darkest of times, there is hope; to not feel Hopeless in my search for love. Maybe Someday or Maybe Not, my prince will come. He won’t be searching to Find(ing) Cinderella, because that’s not who I am. I’m a strong willed, pig-headed, faithful, loving, kind woman. Just like Lily. She knows her own heart. Life isn’t easy; just like love, which encompasses so many things—heartbreaking love, faithful love, romantic love, and even Ugly Love. Love is one of the most complex and complicated things I’ve ever experienced. Just like Lily. At the end of It Ends with Us, I felt so many emotions, I couldn’t even name them all. I sat on this review for days until I could come up with a way to express how the words from this book grabbed hold of my heart and soul and wrapped around them. I’ll be forever changed by Ms. Hoover’s words. The end was really just the Point of Retreat. The point where I sat to attempt to figure out my thoughts and feelings on this book. All I can say is, if you don’t read anything else this year, read—please, please read—It Ends with Us!! ~ Heather, 10 stars"
1875,2.0,"I know. I know. How could I?  Alright, so I've seriously been going back and forth, trying to find the write words to adequately describe how I feel about this book. I don't make my reviews long, but I really need to get some stuff off my chest. Because this book really bugged me. And drew me in like a drug. I'm really wondering if Colleen Hoover was trying to pull a Shakespeare on me. You know, when you're writing really heavy stuff and think, hey, I want my readers to have some comic relief... So let's throw in a few crazy names to lighten the mood.Lilly Bloom Blossom who runs a florist. What the hell?So, it's just a name. You can't give 2 stars for a book everyone is losing sleep over merely for that reason. No, I'm not that harsh. I've always wondered how and why Colleen Hoover manages to release books like a tap would release water (ah, not the best analogy, but it is 2am right now so please forgive me). Now I know. Because it feels rushed. Because she writes in such a way that you're crazy drawn into the emotions that you realise she doesn't really dig that deep into anything. All the crazy shit is just there to gnaw at our emotions, to make us cry. So to put it nicely: you end up with a cluster fuck and an undeveloped story with so many feels you can barely breathe. And to be very frank, I'm kind of over it. I'm over feeling a bunch of shit just for the sake of it. And believe me when I say I get this book. I've been there. I lived with a father who makes Lily's father seem like a complete angel. But I did cry so I must have felt something. I cried for Atlas. And then, just like that, nothing. Because nothing really happens between Atlas and Lily. Because this really isn't a love story.Oh, you didn't know that? Yeah, the author pulled our leg. Tricked us into thinking this was going to be based on a love triangle, when really it was a story of abuse. A trigger warning would have been nice Hoover. But I guess you needed your plot twist and for all of us to gasp and go: OMG. I won't lie. I didn't really want a heavy read. I wanted a love story as pretty as the flowers on the front cover of the book. So when Ryle first hit Lily, I did gasp. I did go OMG. What I didn't expect was for the rest of the book to be about Lily's contemplation to go back to Ryle or not. Yes, I know what Hoover is trying to do: she's trying to paint a realistic picture of what a lot of women go through. Believe me, I get it. My mum did it for twenty years. So I wanted a love story and I got something that wasn't. Build a bridge and get over it, right? Well, maybe I should. Maybe I will. And then there's the inclusion of Ellen Degeneres. This just felt like a publicity stunt. You know, adding it in with the hopes that Ellen will hear about it, read it to her audience, the world will be talking about Hoover, book sales go up etc etc. And don't even get me started with the name Dory. I am mad right now. I haven't been this mad at a book since Beautiful Disaster (and what a disaster that was). I think I'll sleep now..."

Pero eso de ser el mejor libro de CoHo, para mí no lo fue, vamos, es ""lindo"", tan realista, te involucras con los personajes, sientes el dolor de cada uno de ellos, los amas, los odios, los vuelves a amar, los justificas un tanto...!Por deos! en estos momentos mi cabeza está hecha un desastre para expresar lo que siento, esas últimas páginas, y esas palabras por parte de la protagonista, me torturaban a cada segundo, era indescriptible el dolor que debió de sentir Ryle, personalmente, fue muy cruel, sí se las hubieran dicho al padre de Lily no sentiría lástima o sí Ryle fuera realmente como el padre de ella tampoco, pero no sé si son las emociones en ebullición en este instante, pero sentí que Ryle no era como su padre, en ningún momento le pego ""directamente"" a excepción de casi violarla, ¡para nada justifico ese comportamiento en está escena!, se excedió luego de probablemente leer su diario o simplemente conocer un poco la historia de la madre; aunque como la misma protagonista dijo, debió de ser sincera con él desde el principio, vuelvo a repetir, no justifico su accionar pero no vi a Ryle siendo un abusador tal cual ellos lo son, pero tal vez me dirán ustedes: ""¡se puede convertir, tonta!"" No, me niego a creerlo.Le aplaudo a las autora por escribir este libro y dejar un mensaje significativo para cada mujer, pero estoy en ese porcentaje de lectores que no lo volverían a leer, demasiado para mí y mi pobre corazón, por este motivo nunca me han gustado las historias con tríos amorosos o que se le acerquen (el caso de este), me dejan con un mal sabor de boca que nunca podré olvidar.

1878,5.0,"5+ starsWith It End With Us, Colleen Hoover has easily delivered my favorite book of hers yet. It’s profound and entirely enthralling. This story gripped me from the first chapter and refused to let go until the very last word. It left me fundamentally changed and in awe of Hoover’s talent.I was completely blown away by the strength of the characters in this story. Lily and Atlas are young adults who audaciously stand united against adversity and life’s harrowing circumstances.

""There is no such thing as bad people. We're all just people who sometimes do bad things.""
Como siempre, Colleen nunca deja de sorprenderme. Sea lo que sea, sobre la trama que sea. Estaremos de acuerdo que todos sus libros son de romance y, a su manera, cada uno es distinto y por ende la trama que tienen también.Nunca leyendo a Colleen me he aburrido y esta tampoco fue la excepción. Me enganchó desde el principio hasta el final. Me enamoré de los personajes, de sus vidas, del romance entre ellos, etc.Es difícil poder decir cuál de sus libros me gusta más: unos me gustan más que otros, otros son mis favoritos, favoritos de todos los que he leído de cualquier otro autor. Por razones que quiero ir desglosando a través de mi espero-no-tan-extensa reseña, me gustaría decir que este libro definitivamente pasó a ser mi favorito.Primero que nada, me gusta que con sus libros nunca sé que es con lo que me voy a encontrar entre sus páginas. Cada uno de sus libros me impresionan en la forma en que hace llevar la historia y los sucesos que ocurren en él, como los quiebres de la historia, las experiencias entre los personajes, etc., pero siempre lleva los sucesos a cosas que no me imaginé que podrían suceder y eso me ha ocurrido con Colleen en todos sus libros. Es algo maravilloso que siento que ella provoca en mí, y espero que a los demás lectores también. It Ends with Us comienza un tanto diferente a los otros: el seudo insta-love entre Lily y Ryle fue, como su nombre lo dice, instantáneo, lol. Es sabido que sus personajes sienten atracción el uno del otro de forma instantánea y creo, muy al pesar de lo que otras personas puedan decir, es algo que (en especial por parte de Colleen) me gusta. Sé que a otras personas les molesta, les molesta los insta-love, incluso les molesta no sólo de Colleen sino de cualquier autor. La verdad es que a mí no. No tanto, la verdad. Y lo que es más, a mí me gusta mucho. Con todo y eso, me pareció que la atracción entre Lily y Ryle es la única de sus personajes hasta ahora los cuales se la confiesen en el primer capítulo. O sea, estaba leyendo y Ryle le dice I want to fuck you,Me impresionó y gustó al mismo tiempo, que incluyera la tensión entre ambos desde el primer capítulo.Sus personajes femeninos son geniales y son de mis favoritos. Lily no es la excepción a ninguna de las que ha creado hasta ahora. Tiene fuerza, personalidad, todo lo que es característico en Colleen, incluyendo a los masculinos, que tienen ese no sé qué, que me hacen enamorarme enseguida. Sí, me enamoro de los femeninos también porque me gustan mucho. Me gusta la personalidad que tienen y me he dado cuenta que cada una es especial a su manera pero todas tienen en común que son personajes muy fuertes, que me llaman la atención, y por ende, sus personajes femeninos son pero de lejos, mis favoritos.
""But for the past week, I haven't been able to get you out of my head. I don't know why. At work, at home. All I can think about is how crazy it feels when I'm near you, and I need you to make it stop, Lily.""
Ryle tampoco se diferencia mucho de los protagonistas masculinos y en seguida me gustó. No sé que es lo que tienen sus personajes masculinos pero JDJKJBAK todos me fascinan y hacen que se me paren los pelos. Lamentablemente de Atlas no se puede ver más allá de lo que Lily lee en sus diarios y en un par de capítulos del ""ahora"" en la vida de Lily. Creo que es uno de los primeros libros suyos donde existen dos personajes masculinos que me ponen mal (sí, mal) y esto es porque: Por una parte, en el presente, se encuentra Ryle con sus Make it stop, I still very much want to fuck youEs el típico personaje masculino de Colleen que me pone los pelos de punta. No se sabe que es lo que piensan, o que es lo harán a continuación porque tienen ese aire de misterio que me fascina, y como va a tratar de conquistar a la chica y así. Colleen es especialista en que al principio no sea nada más que un tira y afloja entre ambos porque se gustan, quieren pero no quieren, y eso me estresa demasiado (de una buena manera) y necesito saber en qué parte, en que capítulo, por fin se dignarán a lanzar la primera piedra y volverse ""algo"" y comenzar a salir, etc. Pero luego estaban los diarios de Lily. Fucking diariosLily los leía y ya me enamoraba también de Atlas tbh. Aunque haya sido esto en tiempo ""pasado"" definitivamente Atlas también me gustó desde el principio. No de la misma forma en que Ryle, porque claramente, Ryle podía mostrar más su manera de ser o su personalidad pero Atlas no, pero por ser personaje de Colleen, Atlas también tenía su aire de misterio, distinto al resto, pero de igual manera me gustó mucho. Luego de pasados unos capítulos Atlas también mostró lados de su personalidad y me gustó más todavía. Pero como no todo es color de rosa en los libros de Colleen, algo malo tenía que pasar. Y pasó.Por un instante me costó procesar el momento de la lectura cuando Ryle le ""pegó"". En inglés la palabra fue pushed y eso entre que significa empujar, dar un empujón, golpear. Pero un empujón no es lo mismo que golpear, so... me sentí no sé, marqué ocupado. Luego Lily relataba el dolor que sentía, lo que tenía al lado de su ojo en el mismo momento que cuando Ryle le ""pegaba"" y el quiebre de la historia fue justo en ese momento y por una parte, me resignaba que lo que había leído era efectivamente lo que había entendido pero luego pasó la segunda vez y dije: no me gusta hacia dónde se dirige porque Ryle me encanta.Eso me llevó a pensar más allá del comportamiento de Ryle y sea cuales hayan sido los motivos y las ""justificaciones"" de porqué le pegaba. Él nunca antes había querido nada con nadie, hasta Lily. So... siempre que se ""enojaba"" era algo relacionado con Lily y Atlas. Más allá de que haya sido una persona abusiva, me puse a pensar que posiblemente podría ser un celopata. No podía perder el control más que por otra cosa, más que por el pensamiento de que Lily seguía enamorada de Atlas. Todos sus ataques fueron por él, sus peleas con Lily, así que, definitivamente tenía problemas con controlar sus celos, aunque claro, está también el hecho que se explica a Lily que porqué pierde el control de esa manera y así... pero hay que admitir que también tenía un problema con el enojo que le causaba pensar en Lily con alguien más: so, celopata.Cuando pasó la segunda vez de verdad no quería seguir. No quería seguir leyendo y creer que un personaje tan perfecto de Colleen fuera así. Todos sus personajes masculinos son más bien del tipo idealizado: el chico perfecto que quiere proteger a la chica y daría lo que fuera por ella, algo así más bien cliché, así que durante todo ese tiempo después, me ponía a pensar mientras leía todo se tenía que arreglar pero... después ocurrió otra vez. Sea cual sea el motivo de porque era abusivo, un personaje de Colleen nunca es malo. Todos tienen más cosas buenas que malas y Ryle tenía sus cosas buenas, pero las cosas malas tapaban sus buenas y... eso me hizo reflexionar y me di cuenta (antes del final y leer lo de después) que este libro es distinto a todos los demás. No diría más ""realista"" pero incluso ella misma puso al final que muchas veces quiso cambiar hacia dónde se dirigía la historia porque no quería convertir a Ryle en alguien así, pero este libro es tan personal suyo, que igual lo hizo y siguió y lo convierto en quien ella quería que fuera. Para que el libro fuera así, la verdad es que tenía que hacerlo. Colleen mezcló sus capacidades de hacerme sentir de todo con sus personajes y le agregó una experiencia importante para ella así que por cómo lo hizo y lo manejó, este libro pasó a ser mi favorito. El favorito no sólo de Colleen sino de todos. Por un momento pensé que Lily lo perdonaría porque ya casi llegando al final tiraba a que lo iba a perdonar y que iban a seguir juntos con su hijita y felices para siempre. Por eso el final me hizo llorar demasiado, sobre todo cuando le decía a Ryle que qué haría si su hija fuera a contarle que su esposo la golpeó... eso simplemente me rompió el corazoncito . Quería creerlo pero Lily nunca iba a ser como su mamá pero todo era tan bello llegando hacia el final entre ellos... con cierta tensión y distanciamiento pero de todas formas Ryle trató de alejarse lo más posible, la ayudaba cuando lo necesitaba. Cuando vio por primera vez su barriguita de embarazada y le dijo que era hermosa... I cant. Rompí en llanto cuando todo acabó y ahí, en el capítulo final, se entiende el título... pues yo pensé significaba lo que significaba porque se iba a quedar con uno de los dos, Ryle o Atlas, pero no, significa lo que significa por su hija. Para darle una infancia mejor de la que ella tuvo. Tengo sentimientos encontrados porque el libro sí me gustó, el final de igual forma, aunque me haya dolido en el alma. Me gustó pero siento que me falta, sobre todo me falta de Atlas. Sé que al igual que Ryle y sus demás personajes, él hubiera sido igual de perfecto pero quede con un gustito a poco. Me hubiese gustado que hubiera habido más y aunque cada vez que leía sobre él me enamoraba también, siento que me tiene que enamorar aún más. Me hizo llorar fuerte cuando le confesó a Lily que había ido a esa vieja casa a suicidarse y que no lo hizo porque la vio a ella. Que lo había salvado mucho antes incluso de que ella intentara ayudarlo... omg, por eso necesito más de él, Colleen. Pls.
""Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.""
La nota de Colleen me hizo llorar mucho, más incluso que el propio final del libro. Fue algo muy lindo que compartiera su experiencia al final y que haya explicado el significado del libro no sólo para ella sino también por su mamá. Así que por pienso que el libro es distinto a todos los demás. Es más personal, más doloroso para ella. El compartir algo así no debe ser fácil, incluso si no eras tú la que no vivía en carne propia el abuso. El saber que alguien tan preciado para ti, como la mamá, es golpeado y abusado por tu otra persona querida, debe de doler mucho. Y más todavía si no puedes hacer nada por tratar de arreglarlo. Así es como se sentía Lily. Así es como se sentía Colleen. Siento que siempre los libros de Colleen dejan una enseñanza o al menos nos marcan (bueno a mí si, es mi autora favorita por este motivo) y este libro por haber sido algo tan personal, deja marcado algo mil veces más grande en el corazón de lo que lo han hecho los demás hasta ahora. Muy sinceramente pienso que el libro de verdad vale la pena. No es nada como lo que Colleen haya escrito antes. La historia es desgarradora, es hermosa, triste, buena, etc. Es una montaña de emociones, de sentimientos encontrados. El saber lo que significa para ella y lo que nos está tratando de transmitir con él... Idk. Nunca dejes de escribir Colleen, por favor. So, gracias los dioses de libros por Colleen Hoover. Una vez más."
1883,5.0," 5 BIG HEARTBREAKING STARS    There is no such thing as bad people. We're all just people who sometimes so bad things.  Wow this book. What an emotional journey. This was one of the hardest and most raw books I've ever read. It was so  real  and  riveting . I couldn't get enough of it. I couldn't stop reading yet I didn't want to keep reading. Such a different experience. Reading a Colleen Hoover book is like going through an eye opening journey and this one was no different and was one of the hardest but most worthwhile to battle through.  All humans make mistakes. What determines a persons character aren't the mistakes we make. It's how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuse.   It was so  sad  but I can't begin to express enough how   IMPORTANT   this book is. Every female needs to read this. Every single girl should read this and understand the importance of this novel. Actually, everyone with a pulse should read this book.  Imagine all the people you meet in your life. There are so many. They come in like waves, trickling in and out with the tide. Some waves are much bigger and make more of an impact than others. Sometimes the waves bring with them things from deep in the bottom of the sea and they leave those things tossed onto the shore. Imprints against the grains of sand that prove the wave have once been there, long after the tide recedes. That was what Atlas was telling me when he said ""I love you."" He was letting me know that I was the biggest wave he'd ever come across. And I brought so much with me that my impressions would always be there, even when the tide rolled out.  The best way to fully grasps the importance of this story emotionally is to go into it blind. It follows Lily who meets this amazing neurosurgeon named Ryle and they fall head over heels in love. But Ryle has a dark past and that begins to interfere with their relationship in this worst way. Then Atlas, Lily's first love from when they were teenagers makes an appearance and everything Lily has been building gets shaken.   ""Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a persons actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no one attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.  The way that Colleen Hoover writes puts you right in the situation that Lily is in head first and makes you fall in love with both Ryle and Atlas. And it's so  twisted  because of the kind of guy one of them turns out to be.  I'm sure you didn't miss me like I missed you, but sometimes the things that matter to you most are also the things that hurt you the most. And in order to get over that hurt, you have to sever all the extensions of my pain, so I guess that what I was doing. I was just trying to save myself a little bit of agony.   In between this passionate love story that's going on with Ryle and Lily we get these sweet innocent flashbacks of a life with a sixteen year old Lily and Atlas. Atlas who is this homeless boy who finds hope and a home in Lily. And Lily who is living a nightmare of home life and seeks comfort in him. Those stories were my favorite.   ""Lily,"" he whispers, still holding me tightly. ""I know this is the last thing you need to hear right now. But I have to say it because I've walked away from you too many times without saying what I really want to say.""He pulls back to look down at me and when he sees my tears, he brings his hands up to my cheeks.""In the future...if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again...fall in love with me."" He presses his lips against my forehead. ""You're still my favorite person, Lily. Always will be.""  But I still loved the blooming relationship between her and Ryle. Ryle who is arrogant, smart, charismatic. These are two VERY different relationships and the deeper we dig into the relationship with Lily and Ryle the harder that relationship becomes and the tougher it is to read.   Maybe love isn't something that comes full circle. It just ebbs and flow, in and out, just like the people in our lives. Just because we didn't up on the same wave, doesn't mean we aren't apart of the same ocean.  Two other very important relationships is the friendship she has with Allysa, who I loved! Her and Marshall were amazing friends and their interactions were so much fun to read. The other significant relationship was between Lily and her mother. I loved, loved their scenes together, especially the last one!   Sometimes even grown women need their mothers comfort so we can just take a break from having to be strong all the time. Then the cuteness of the Dear Ellen letters.   just keep swimming  All in all, this was definitely the most important Colleen Hoover book and is a complete MUST READ. I laughed, I cried happy tears then a lot of sad tears. Then the authors note at the end just breaks your heart even more. So many times I had to close the book and walk away because this book makes you feel so many different emotions and at times, not the good kind. But on the other hand, this book definitely has the power to save lives and give some girls the strength they need to make the hard choice and walk away. Thank you Colleen Hoover for sharing your families naked truth with us by being brave and bold. Truly an unforgettable love story.  ""Cycles exist because they are excruciating to break. It takes an astronomical amount of pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern. Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiar circles rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet. My mother went through it.I went through it.I'll be damned if I allow my daughter to go through the it.I kiss her on the forehead and make her a promise. ""It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.""  "

** 10 GLOWING “naked truths” STARS **


“There is no such thing as BAD PEOPLE. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”

There are books that make you happy. Ones that take you to foreign worlds and help you escape reality. Ones that open your eyes. Ones that shock you. Ones that make you cry your eyes out. And then there're ones that become perhaps a bit too PERSONAL for you... They touch something inside you that you've hidden from the world, from all your loved ones, and from yourself. Something you've endured for years, and never spoke of...because talking about it somehow makes it REAL.This is a story that touched my secrets, my 
naked truths
...This is a story about love, mistakes, maybes, choices and strength.This is the story of Lily Bloom.This is the story of my Mom. Of me and my sister.This is the story of many women around the world.

All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.

THANK YOU Colleen Hoover for reminding me that even though there will always be times that I “keep pretending to swim and just float around, barely keeping my head above the water”...all I need to do to make sure I don't lose at this high level game called life is to remember to KEEP SWIMMING. For me and my family. And thank you Mom...for being “brave and bold”, just like Lily. 

“It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's THE LOVE. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”

...with the strong recommendation and support of the lovely Sandy ღCoffeeAddictBooksღ! I couldn't have come out of this journey if you weren't there to hold my hand along the way bestie. I love you! ♥"
1885,4.0,"This is definitely one of the better contemporary romances I’ve read in recent memory. What makes it good is that Hoover deals with some challenging topics, and I found myself wondering which love interest I was supposed to be rooting for. It was more complicated than other romances I’ve read, which I like. A lot. The main character Lily is young but already working hard to achieve her career goals. She’s haunted by hard times she faced in her childhood as well as by memories of her first love. She never seems desperate to fall in love, but then again, she’s only twenty-three when the novel begins. In any case, I highly recommend this for people who like books with romantic elements.

1887,5.0,"I don't know how to put how much I loved this book or how important it was to me into words, but I will try my best. It Ends With Us is about breaking the cycle of abuse. If you read this book, I promise you the following things:- Tons of Ellen references- Swoon worthy romance- A love triangle (I mean, it wasn't really a triangle in the end, I thought the choice was obvious)- Commentary on homelessness in America- Domestic Violence- Excruciating Heartbreak- Lots and lots of cryingI wasn't sure if I was going to like this. It obviously has a lot of hype, and the last romance book I read with a lot of hype didn't strike my fancy, so I was worried that it wouldn't be good. But I was obviously very wrong. I feel like- everyone should read this book. We should read it in school. I'm 100% serious. On Ryle: I'm not gonna lie, I knew Ryle was bad news from the start. From the moment she met him I was like, ""Gurrll, don't do it!"" Sigh. If only characters in books would listen to me. But if they did, books would probably be very boring, because nothing bad would ever happen to them. I don't want to spoil it for you, but I will say that just because someone is a neurosurgeon doesn't mean they're a nice person or a good partner. On Atlas: Yeah, just like I knew Ryle was bad news from the start, I fell in love with Atlas immediately. He is the sweetest and most lovable person in this whole book probably, fight me on that. On The Other Characters: I loved (almost) all of the characters in this book, even though a lot of them were wealthy, I didn't find them spoiled or insincere, I loved Allysa and Marshall and even Lily's mom. Also, can I just say that Allysa and Marshall's story was like the cutest thing ever? Because it totally was. I am an abuse survivor and have had my share of not-so-nice boyfriends, so this definitely struck a chord with me and was a really cathartic read. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Seriously, this is a monumental piece of literature, even if you don't traditionally like romance, I would give this one a shot. "
1888,5.0,i'm definitely not okay. 
1889,5.0,"Wow, what an emotional roller coaster of a ride. This book captured my heart from the start and held it captive even after reading the last page. This book is so much more than your typical romance novel, it delves into an important issue that impacts so many families. Life is not black and white, and love can be complicated and messy, yet also beautiful and unconditional as described in this quote: ""Despite the resentment I've built up in my heart toward him, it doesn't mean the emotions aren't still there. Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.""The personal connection the author had to the story was evident in the beauty and rawness of the writing. I loved the journal entries, and have to wonder ""has Ellen DeGeneres read this book?"".This was the first book I read by Colleen Hoover, it will definitely not be the last."
1890,5.0,"Este libro es una de las mejores cosas que he tenido. Es de las MEJORES historias que he leido, es una historia hermosa y desgarradora a la vez. No puedo expresar todo lo que estoy sintiendo en estos momentos. Nunca había leído algo parecido a esto, y realmente me gustaría tomarme un tiempo antes de volver a leer algún libro que trate temas tan sensibles, no creí que me afectaría de esta manera. Ni siquiera tengo fuerzas para escribir lo que siento y lo que pienso de la historia. Este libro me deja reflexionando tanto y agradezco por ello a la autora. Ha dejado una marca en mi, que no se va a ir nunca, estoy segura de ello. Simplemente maravilloso."
1891,3.0,Okay I changed my rating from 2 to 3 stars because it 'dawned' upon me that it actually wasn't bad....? I can't believe I'm saying this but I actually liked a Colleen Hoover book.
1892,4.0,"This is another heartaching, tearful book of Colleen Hoover. The author gently weaves an amazing story about finding trust, finding your love, appreciating your own life, and be thankful of the little things you have in life. To the outside world, Lily and Ryle seem to have it all. They are deeply in love and truly care for each other. But, as time passes, something alters the picture of their perfect relationship. A frightening pattern is taking shape—a cycle of hurt, denial, and promises.The reality is, many, many people have grown up in dysfunctional homes, so far away from normal we don't even know what normal tastes like. It Ends With Us shows the overwhelming love, soul connection followed by betrayal and pain. The difficulty and deep shame of allowing oneself to be abused. Colleen Hoover does an awesome job of evenly portraying both sides of this dysfunctional relationship. In the beginning, I found myself cheering for Lily and Ryle to make it, despite him being abusive. You get to know the good in him, that he truly does love her and deserves another chance.However, there is a second aspect of this story, when Αtlas, Lily’s first love, reappears after many years. Atlas had witnessed many times Lily’s father’s violent outbursts and had been a victim of his abusive behavior. Atlas recognizes the warning signs on Lily and is worried for her. Ryle’s jealousy for Lily’s ex increases the damage that is done to them. Atlas helps her to cope with the shock of the abuse while Lily wrestles with questions she never dreamed she would face: How can she leave? Then again, how can she stay?This suspenseful story of love, fear, and safety, made me realize that trusting others is not always easy and no matter how much time has passed, previous burdens can haunt you until you have received full closure from the fearful situation. It is a poignant, unforgettable and bittersweet portrait of love, pain, difficult dilemmas and commitment. The darker subjects were powerful and included issues about poverty and abuse. The three main characters that faced life's burdens grew to become close to the reader’s heart. I really enjoyed the book. It had the right amount of suspense that lasted consistently throughout the story. My reason for not giving this book a full 5 is because I felt the ending was a bit rushed. I wish more had been mentioned about Atlas and his role towards the end of the book, because it felt that part was left hanging despite his part in the story. I would highly encourage you to read this. Gripping story from beginning to end!"
1893,5.0,"Initial thoughts upon finishing the book:I don't know how to recover from this book. It was on a whole different level - exceeding all expectations. There just aren't enough words to express how powerful it is and how deeply it affected me. Absolutely Colleen's best book to date. And hands down the best book of 2016. ________________________Review a few months after...I honestly dreaded doing this review. Not because I didn't like the book, because the opposite couldn't be more true. This book was so incredible that I feel any review I give it will be inadequate. You've heard me praise Colleen Hoover's books time and time again, and she's without a doubt my favorite author. But what she gives us with her new book is a complete game changer. She has written a story so emotional and heartbreaking, yet hopeful and moving that any review from me could never do it justice.Colleen has told her readers that this book is very personal to her, and I felt it. It was one of the most eye-opening, emotional stories I've ever read. Her talent for writing a unique story never ceases to amaze me. But it's also the way she makes me think and question things that makes her writing so exceptional.It's easy to judge and form opinions about a person's situation when you haven't experienced it first hand. Colleen does a fantastic job of putting the reader in the shoes of her characters, while packing an emotional punch, and making you question everything you think is right or wrong. I started going into more details about the story, but I really feel like the best way to read this book is by going in blindly, as I did. I had no idea what the book was going to be about, and after finishing it, I'm glad I didn't. But be prepared for the emotional impact it will have on you - and keep the tissues close by! This is a book that will stay with you long after you finish the last page.A beautiful story of bravery, strength and hope - this book will change people's lives. It's without a doubt Colleen's best work.ARC provided via the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
1894,1.0,"I have never read a book by this author before, so I have no connection to her style of writing. But I gave her new one a go because so many people were talking about it. Although the main theme in the story was harrowing, I found the writing itself to be simple and uninspired. Tacky to a point. The characters were superficial and unlikeable and their interactions were inauthentic. I dragged my way through the story hoping that the great parts were still to come, but it was just more of the same - with less subtlety. It is unlikely that I would attempt another of Hoover's books."
1895,4.0,I loved the message Colleen Hoover brought out from this story. Abuse is such a touchy subject and Hoover did an amazing job in making not only that aware but also homelessness. There were so many cute moments in this book as well as equally depressing ones. It was so realistic and honest.Plot - 19/20 Characters - 17/20 Creativity - 18/20Writing - 17/20 Pace - 10/10Ending - 7/1088/100 = B3.5/5 stars

1898,5.0,"Many of you read this a while ago, but I'm sure you still have those raw feelings I'm experiencing now. This is an unforgettable book about love, compassion and some unforgivable behavior. The main character, Lily, is a statue of resilience and Torn Between Two Lovers. (🎶 Mary MacGregor)Staying in a home with an abusive relationship, apparently is not the best decision, but for some it is not even a choice. A home should be a safety net drawn tightly to protect its inhabitants not a forbidden area, but this gives you a look at the sensitive situation that is so heart wrenching it becomes very realistic. While finishing it, I came to a grim face plant that many children experience a disillusional childhood and an apparent need for survival and acceptance being magnified. This brought reality to ""nothing is as it seems"". When Lily was still at home with her parents, she heard her parents go beyond the arguing into physical abuse. She destined her future relationships to never be like her parents. Her compassion for another human was delivered neatly on a doorstep of an abandoned home next door. Atlas, who was a homeless teen tucked away inside did not want anyone to know he was living there. She delivered him food and blankets when her parents were not around to see her. Their friendship grew romantically and spicy! Years later, after Lily finished college and moved to Boston on her own, she started her own Floral business. She meets one of the most handsome and compassionate neurosurgeons, Ryle, that leads into another romantic and spicy relationship. Her life was falling in line with dreams coming true until their relationship suffered insecurities and unforgivable behavior that suffered even more due to her recent encounter with her first love, Atlas. A great story that is written from the heart and soul of Colleen Hoover's childhood experience. When they said it was ""a Must Read"", they meant it. 😭 It was an incredible, emotional ride. “Keep swimming…” Www.thehotline.org victims of domestic violence Www.homelessresourcenetwork.org"

That is not all. There were the “naked truths” and the writing, which I haven’t mentioned…. yet. It Ends With Us is written in a very touching way. It speaks to your heart. Why not 5 Stars, then? Because of the epilogue. It let me down.It Ends With Us, as the title implies, is a distressing, moving, powerful, and emotional story. Lily's story.Lily grew up watching her mother being abused by her father. As a result, she knows very well what she doesn’t want for her life. Talk about life throwing you a curveball… years later, it’s Lily’s turn to fall in an abusive pattern as she met and fell in love with Ryle.Ryle is a handsome, compassionate, funny and smart guy, but with moments of unforgivable behaviour. A really great guy, until he loses his marbles. Honestly, I wish Ryle was a SOB, but he is not, which adds to my mixed feelings. He really wants to change and be a better person. I like Ryle, a lot. Don’t take me wrong, though, it doesn’t mean I wanted Lily to be with him. Unfortunately, I don’t believe he could change. This is not a love triangle but we do have another guy in the story: Atlas.Atlas is a boy who played a big part in Lily’s life when she was 15. His story by itself was already moving. Atlas was kicked out from his house and was living in an abandoned house behind Lily’s. Without electricity, food, clothes or the very basics he had a very hard time. Lily, touched by Atlas poor situation ended up getting involved with him, until her aggressive father gives him the beating of his life. Atlas then, leaves for the marines.As you can see this was not an easy read, but alas, I loved it. I won’t be giving it 5 Stars (remember the epilogue?)But the impact of the story on my nerves, was if as such. I am happy for Lily. There were moments that I thought she wouldn’t make it. “Sometimes… when I’m really missing him… I tell myself that maybe it wasn’t that bad. Maybe I could put up with him when he’s at his worst just so I can have him when he’s at his best.” I am also happy for the message in here. It gives me hope that people can break free from an abusive relationship if they really want, if they are brave and strong.I am sorry but I need to talk about that Epilogue. How I wish there was no Epilogue. Please, don’t throw me tomatoes or curse me. I was in such a high with Lily’s decision about breaking free and moving on. I wanted a HEA for Lily and Atlas. But not the way it happened, bumping into each other in the middle of a street. They hugged, had a laugh, she asked him some silly question and that was it. It didn’t convince me. They’ve been apart for too long and had little interaction when they met again. Everything felt rushed and my heart, sadly, couldn’t follow the pace in that end. It felt shallow.A special note to the Author:Dear Colleen,Your “Note from the Author” moved me to tears.In the story, Lily said to her Mom: “I want to be you when I grow up.” She thought that her Mom was the strongest person she knew. I have to differ. Lily’s Mom got used to stretch her limits. She passively waited for life to run its course and was only set free once her husband died.Now, if there is a person who deserved to hear “I want to be you when I grow up”, this person is your Mom.Hats off to your Mom. She was brave and strong enough to break free from a destructive and abusive marriage when you and your sister were still very young. It takes guts and courage to start all over again, even more as a single mother. I can only imagine how painful and difficult it was. But your Mom did it. And I bet that the person you (and your sisters) become today is your Mom’s greatest reward.Love,Jan xxx (hide spoiler)]"
1900,4.0,I’m gonna pretend HE did not just get away with what he did. 
1901,5.0,"Wow, just wow. I'll come back to write my review when I can make sense of the mess in my head. Absolutely brilliant. Loved it.FULL REVIEWI apologize in advance if this review rambles but my head is still reeling from this experience. I'd also like to caution that this review may contain slight spoilers, although I'll try my best not to mention anything specific, as I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, yet it's difficult to discuss how I'm feeling without mentioning a few things.This book put me through the ringer, and I'm still feeling the aftershocks. I love books that make me question my own beliefs and really give me pause to stop and think. It Ends With Us is one of those books. I have no personal experience of the subject matter but I have always had sympathy for anyone going through such a situation. It was no surprise that I really felt for Lily and shared her pain, grief, heartache, and confusion. I found myself constantly stopping to imagine how I might feel, how I would act, if I was in a similar situation, and I honestly don't know how I would deal with it.What shocked me, what was entirely unexpected, was how much I felt for Ryle. Don't get me wrong, I wanted her to do what she did, and he was definitely in the wrong, but he wasn't a really nasty person. He was hugely flawed, damaged, and he couldn't control his emotions, but there was no doubt in my mind that he loved her. Probably too much which is where his issues stemmed from. When I reflected on the initial scene where they met (so so good - the dialogue was unbelievably brilliant) I could see how self-aware he was. He indulged in one night stands with no strings and he didn't have relationships because he knew he was incapable of same. He should have stuck to that, but then we wouldn't have had a story.I loved the letters to Ellen and the retelling of her time with Atlas. It was heartwarming and gut-wrenching at the same time. I really felt their connection, and I was rooting for them and then I became conflicted because Ryle was so perfect at the start and I felt their chemistry and their love and then...Gosh, my heart is pounding again. And that twist - oh my Lord, I was cut up all over again when that happened.I don't think I'll every forget this book. The last one that ripped my insides apart was Bright Side by Kim Holden (so good - go read it if you haven't already.) Different story but it delivered the same powerful emotional turmoil.My only complaint is that I wanted more of ""present day"" Atlas but I'm greedy like that! A little novella now would be great, Colleen, hint hint!I loved the personal note Colleen included at the end, and the personal connection she had to this story shines through.It is quite simply masterful. Absolutely superb. She nailed the emotions and managed to end it on a positive note and I'm going to be feeling all the feels for a lot while.Highly Recommended, but make sure you have a box of tissues because you'll need them."
1902,5.0,"***EDITED***Definitely a top feminist’s book.Naked truth?:It took me a little over 24 hours to read this book, away time not included.I want to start with the beauty of the progression of this main character Lily Bloom, and how you can see that by even just the first and last sentences.First sentence: “As I sit here with one foot on either side of the ledge, looking down from twelve stories above the streets of Boston, I can’t help but think about suicide.”Last sentence: “You can stop swimming now, Lily. We’ve finally reached the shore.”I think this shows how she went from angry and hurt, vengeful and holding a grudge against her abusive father to falling in love, happy, and put together at the end brings light to the fact that although she was in such a scary and dangerous situation, that in the end she was able to find what she was looking for all along. Happiness, Peace, Love, and Security.This book taught me a lot about domestic violence, and what it looks like to outsiders, verses someone inside the situation. I have a whole different and new perspective on it now, courtesy of Colleen Hoover’s writing.Lily was able to stand up for herself. She was able to be strong. This book shows both sides of those on the inside of the situation of domestic violence. Fear, anguish, confusion, mistrust, and wanting who you thought the person was before. She describes the scene and situation so well, and brought to mind so many thoughts and possibilities I’ve never thought could be possible.Disappointedly, I must say, I did not cry. I was ready to cry, I was told I would cry, and thus I expected to cry. I didn’t. But that’s okay. This book still deserves the stars it got. The 5 golden starts above this review. I wouldn’t change the rating for anything.I will definitely be reading more of Colleen Hoover’s books in the future. In fact, I just purchased three more.Colleen, thank you for bringing light to this situation and educating me on how ignorant the perspectives of outsiders are vs. the truth of the insider’s and abuser’s perspectives.The mother-daughter connection in this book between Lily and her mother is beautiful and taught me about the importance of such a thing. The cover was also very visually and aesthetically pleasing.Read this book if you like:⭐️ books with heavy topics⭐️ potential cry. I’m not very emotional, though I know many who did cry.⭐️ happy endings⭐️ true love and soulmates⭐️ deep backstories⭐️ plot twists⭐️ strangers to lovers to enemies⭐️ right person wrong time⭐️ strong and independent main female characters⭐️ young love⭐️ sex scenes. just in case that’s enticing for you.⭐️ books for feminists that show strength and intuition.⭐️ books that teach life long lessons⭐️ it has resource hotlines and websites in the back for homelessness and domestic violence in case you care⭐️ mother-daughter likeness and connection"
1903,4.0,"I had no idea what to expect with this one, it's had excellent reviews and was rated Goodreads choice 2016 winner. I can understand the wide appeal of this book, a book that can tackle a difficult subject yet deliver it with such sensitivity. This book draws you slowly in and then bam it hits you hard in the guts. I was listening on audiobook and actually gasped at one point. I sensed it was coming but still wasn't prepared for the raw shock. Domestic abuse is not an easy subject to read about and I was fully in two minds about how I wanted the ending to be handled. Which makes me appreciate the way this writer managed to convey all range of emotions. My emotions wavered just as Lily's did. Even though I found some of the characters and settings a bit too picture perfect (everyone is super rich and beautiful) that didn't detract from the compelling story and I was fully immersed in the storyline. So much so I was relieved with the ending like I was sucking in my breath the whole time. "
1905,5.0,"I'M IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION WHILE I WAS READING THIS. THIS BOOK SHOULD COME WITH A TRIGGER WARNING BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY HEAVY, SOME PEOPLE CAN'T DEAL WITH IT PROPERLY AND I'M ONE OF THEM.
""Naked Truth."" 
As much as possible I don't want to spoil a big issue of this book since I myself tried to avoid spoilery reviews to not ruin my reading experience.It's good to know as little as possible about the content of this book but judging from what happened to me I think readers should be warned that it's going to be heavy and it's about an abusive relationship. Reading about the abusive relationship and violence in this book triggered my anxiety so as a fellow reader I want you to take caution. I think Colleen Hoover had written a powerful novel that everyone must read but please as much as possible I encourage you to read something light and funny first before you read this.I can't simply review this book without dropping spoilers so if you don't want to be spoiled then I suggest you stop reading right now. ^^(view spoiler)[ I love that Colleen Hoover's made a book about her mother, I cried so much in this book and after reading the author's notes it made me cry even harder. Ugh!“No one is exclusively bad, nor is anyone exclusively good. Some are just forced to work harder at suppressing the bad.” 
I told a friend of mine about this book and that it involves abuse. She then told me that she witnessed domestic violence right before her eyes and that victims stay with the abuser because of:A)Laziness-they are too lazy to fight backB) Security- where would they go? How can they start a new life with less cashC) Shared Psychosis - there's the abuser and the enablerShe can't even sympathize with the victim if that's the case, but that's her opinion. Even the main character thought of domestic violence that way. Then I told her that I wish it was easier to choose A B or C because this book is more than what google or any psychological and social research is telling us. It's so much easier to read the factors and pattern of abuse and know that you can just simply end it. It's so much easier to witness what goes in an abusive relationship and judge the victim and abuser. It's so much easier to be an outsider and judge it as you see it but it's more than what you are just seeing.“Just because someone hurts you doesn’t mean you can simply stop loving them. It’s not a person’s actions that hurt the most. It’s the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”
The characters here are so real and honest that I'm actually with the book not reading but experiencing the best and worst in a relationship. It felt like I'm Lily who saved and loved Atlas, her letters to Ellen was so endearing and heartbreaking at the same time. It felt like I'm Lily who met Ryle and fell in love with him too. And because I felt everything she was feeling that I'm floored when everything happened. It was like I'm in a nightmare and I need to wake up.""Five minutes. That's all it takes to completely destroy a person.""
I love how Colleen Hoover managed to let every character shine in this book and I love it even more that she didn't let me hate a character, not even the abuser. This book is pure honesty, It's a must read, I recommend it to everyone. I repeat EVERYONE! (hide spoiler)]Dory and Ellen De Generes is an important part of this book. So if you love the movie and Ellen then I'm sure you'll love the book even more ...

""just keep swimming""

P.S - I Buddy read this book with Claire .. Drop by her blog to see her review. (^^)"
1906,5.0,"I couldn’t pull myself away from this book and yet I did not want it to end. It Ends With Us was the second book I have had the privilege to read by Colleen Hoover. My opinion of Colleen Hoover’s writing and my opinion about her storytelling rose in leaps and bounds after reading It Ends With Us. Her writing was masterfully constructed and presented. The character development was superb as was the plot development. I do not know why I never had the chance to read this book when it was first published but I am so glad I was able to finally add my name to those that have read it and loved it. The audiobook that I listened to on Overdrive was brilliantly read by Olivia Song. It Ends With Us was a fast paced and gripping emotional read. Colleen Hoover’s raw admission about the circumstances that influenced her writing of It Ends With Us was surprising for me. She based the story in It Ends With Us on her own childhood and life experiences. That made this book even more compelling. It was an emotional and riveting woman’s literature book that was hard to put down or forget.Children do not get to pick their parents or the circumstances under which they are raised. So many children become victims of their environments. It Ends With Us showed how one such child was made to live with domestic violence her whole life and yet was able to make healthy and yet difficult decisions in her grown-up life. Lily Bloom was that child. She grew up with a father that physically, emotionally and verbally abused her mother as long as her earliest memories would allow her to remember. Her mother chose to make excuses for her father and refused to do anything to change her circumstances. As much as Lily begged her mother to leave her father she would not. These experiences molded Lily’s life. Lily was a special child. She saw things as they were and yet she was compassionate towards other people’s circumstances. It was no wonder then that Lily befriended Atlas, the homeless boy that was squatting in the abandoned house behind hers. When others made cruel remarks about his physical appearance and hygiene, Lily saw a person that needed help and a friend. Lily’s and Atlas’s friendship and the relationship that developed between them was beautiful and tender. In order to deal with her swirling emotions and developing feelings, Lily wrote imaginary letters to Ellen, a popular and inspiring T.V. host. Lily posted those letters in several journals but never mailed them or shared their contents with anyone. Her writing allowed Lily to express her feelings, both good and bad, to a non judgmental source. Atlas would hold a special place in Lily’s heart forever, as her first love.Years later, Lily found herself in Boston. She had graduated from college and had a good job. Her father had recently died and Lily felt almost relieved that he would no longer be part of her or her mother’s life. On the night that followed her father’s funeral, Lily found herself on a roof deck where she was contemplating her life dreams, when she realized she was not alone. That was the night Lily met Ryle Kincaid, who aspired to become the best and most brilliant neurosurgeon. The two had completely different outlooks about where their lives were going but fate would take charge and Lily and Ryle would fall head over heels in love with each other and get married. Would Lily allow history to repeat itself or would she allow herself to choose the life she deserved and warranted?It Ends With Us by Colleen Hoover was a powerful book full of hope, difficult decisions, the courage to stand up to what you believe in, grief, heartache and lots of confusion. It was masterful and unforgettable. I admire Colleen Hoover for her courage to write this book and spread awareness and a zero tolerance acceptance towards domestic abuse. This was an emotional read for me and I am not embarrassed to admit that I shed a few tears while I read it. I was glad that it ended with a happy and positive ending. I highly recommend this book to anyone, like myself, that had not had the opportunity to read it yet. "
1907,5.0,"It Ends With Us ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Trigger warnings:Attempted rape Domestic abuse Violence Before starting this book, I tried to lower my high expectations. Recently, it has been hyped up on social media platforms, and it was time to finally read it. Now, I didn't know anything about this book other than the hype surrounding it. First off, I have a hate-to-love relationship with this book. I love the message it sends, I love how the story was carried out and I absolutely love the writing style. On the other hand, I hate the way some scenes makes me want to throw up. This book has important themes that needs to be recognized, but at the same time it is heart-wrenching to read about them. In addition, the story includes the feared (in my opinion of course) pregnancy trope ... Although, I will admit that I do believe the pregnancy was a significant part of Lily's story, especially for her character development. I'm glad I read this and learned, but I would recommend taking the trigger warnings into consideration before you make the decision to read it.I feel the need to add that yep, I fell in love with another fictional character... Atlas, why are you so sweet and caring? Stop it, please, because your not real:("
1908,4.0,"4 🍹 🍹 🍹 🍹The first half was living up to my limited expectations though I was consuming it like a plate of nachos with a margarita (or two, no salt please) and then the second half kicked in and sobered me up. Truth, I only read this to fulfill a pink cover prompt challenge and have some light and fun distraction. It not only delivered on those counts but went outside the box of a Romance novel in the best possible way. "

1911,5.0,"It's been a couple of days since I've finished this book, and I cannot stop thinking about it. This is the first time in a while that I've read a book this quickly and didn't keep checking how long left.This was a rollercoaster of emotions. I smiled and cried.This book is honestly an important read because it gave me an insight into the issues and answered questions I and I'm sure many other people had.I have to be honest, towards the end, I was worried this was going to take the wrong direction, but I'm really happy it didn't.The author's note at the end was so sad. While I didn't cry as much during the actual book, after reading the author's note, I ended up crying a lot more.(view spoiler)[ The only issue I had was I didn't understand how both Lily and Ryle fell in love so quickly. That part made it a bit unrealistic especially considering Ryle did not want a relationship at all. Then suddenly, him not wanting to get married and have kids all changed so quickly?Also, I was not expecting the whole book to focus mainly on Ryle and Lily's relationship. I thought it was going to focus on Lily and Altas. Maybe I heard so many people saying they loved him, so I assumed he was the focus. I do wish we got to see a little bit more of him, but at the same time, I know that wasn't the purpose of the book.  (hide spoiler)]I am really glad I decided to pick this up, and I probably will read more of Colleen Hoover's books in the future!"
1912,5.0,"“Every incident chips away at your limit. Every time youchoose to stay, it makes the next time that much harder to leave. Eventually, you lose sight of your limitaltogether, because you start to think, ‘I’ve lasted five years now. What’s five more?’ ”“Don’t be like me, Lily. I know that you believe heloves you, and I’m sure he does. But he’s not loving you the right way. He doesn’t love you the way youdeserve to be loved.""This book gave me an other perspective to the life of abused women.Yes, I knew that it isn't easy to just give someone up you love but I blamed and I felt anger toward every woman who had a child grow up in a abusive household. It is one thing to stand by the person who abuse you meantaly or physically, but to put your child through all that shit too is unacceptable!For me that thought hasn't changed but because I never was thrown in a situation like this, I didn't even try to think why these people returned to the people who misstreated them, this changed with this book.I loved Ryle from the beginning of the book and even the first time he had pushed her, I didn't really blame him. He panicked and she was just in the way. No biggie.The second time he pushed her and she fell down the stairs, I blamed him but I would forgive him too if I were her, I mean he just didn't see infront of him because of his anger. I understand.By the last time I was suprised with myself. I was reacting to the first two times like he did something insignificant when in reality he did something horrible.I realized that I would be like the people I judge. I would return to him too even tho he would had hurt me two times because all the other times he was amazing and he loved Lily so much and doesn't every human have a flaw?No, infact this isn't a flaw, it's so much more!Like I wrote in my review for Too Late ...Please, please, no matter what gender you are, no matter how much in love you are, no matter your finances, no matter your history, no matter ANYTHING... PLEASE DON'T STAY IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP! With your partner or even your parents or family member.DON'T LET PEOPLE TREAT YOU BADLY!YOU DESERVE TO BE TREATED WITH LOVE AND RESPECT EVEN IF YOU DON'T FEEL OR BELIVE IT! Even if you've been told otherwise. Don't let people tell you you're worth what you given because you DON'T.Cycles exist because they are excruciating to break. It takes an astronomical amount of pain andcourage to disrupt a familiar pattern. Sometimes it seems easier to just keep running in the same familiarcircles, rather than facing the fear of jumping and possibly not landing on your feet."
1913,4.0," “Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen.”Reading the blurb for It Ends With Us will not prepare you for what you are about to get into. It will not prepare you for moments so intense, you will have to put the book down and just exhale. It will not warn you to be wary of what people are capable of. The blurb for It Ends With Us only gives a hint of the conflicting emotions you will feel while reading this book, and that is exactly how it should be. No one is really prepared to go through what Lily experiences in this book. Reading the story from her perspective with very little background information will allow the novel to have a greater impact on you. I’m telling you that you will not see this shit coming and it will hurt. What I really like about this book is how it shows us that we can’t know what our reaction to a situation will be until we experience it. Hoover expertly put me in a position where I could make general statements about how I would never fall for this and never put up with that. She allowed me to think I was smart enough to spot the red flags and act accordingly. Hoover took the confidence I had in my own judgement and crushed it because knowing what you should do in a situation and knowing what you will do in a situation are two completely different things. Another thing that Hoover brilliantly got across was that you can’t make assumptions about people’s character. There were four people in this book who I thought I had figured out and one by one they all proved to be so much more complex than I had anticipated. I saw remorse when I expected belligerence, support when I expected opposition, and wisdom when I just knew there would be excuses. I was never a huge fan of Hoover and if you’re in the same boat, don’t let that prevent you from giving this book a chance. Guys believe me; It Ends With Us is worth a chance.If you haven’t read the book I would strongly encourage you to read these trigger warnings (view spoiler)[ (domestic violence, attempted rape)  (hide spoiler)] and nothing about the plot. Do not spoil the events of this story for yourself because struggling along with Lily is part of a learning experience that will last beyond the pages of this novel."
1914,5.0,"Hey all!! Sorry I haven’t been active but I need to start updating YALL more!!!! This book wow….so much to say. For starters I have to say this is one of the best books I’ve ever read. It’s also fast paced so for all of my ppl in a book slump or wants to get into reading, this is such a good book. Its one of those books that I’ve read in literally a day and I could not put it down. The characterization was absolutely beautiful. The way all of them were so different, unique, and had all of their little quirks and imperfections that made the book worth while. As for the plot, I though it was so beautifully written. I loved the way the author included Lily’s (the main character) fairy entries throughout the book, it really gave a sense about what kind of childhood she had and truly acquired the reader with more knowledge about what type of person she is. This book had so many shocking twists and turns, kept my eyes glued to the book, and in some cases I had to put the book down because of how intense it was. PLSSS if you can get this book, I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend it!!!!!!!!"

1916,5.0,"I have so much that I want to say. So many things I want to share and so many feelings raging within me after reading It Ends with Us. Never have I felt such empathy for a writer, a character, and a situation. The last time I was this moved by a situation was after reading Forbidden by Tabitha Suzuma, but this time I had some resolution. An ever-after that not only felt right, but was deserved and needed.When an author rips herself open like this, her blood becomes the ink on the page, memories are the water colored paintings on the wall, and tears become the flowing plotline that weaves not only a story of love gone wrong, but also of understanding the victim. What Collen Hoover wrote is deeply personal, and in freeing her soul to the world, I feel that she is also letting people know that they are not alone.The “letter to the reader” from Colleen Hoover not only provided the inspiration for It Ends with Us, but reveals deeply personal family history. The bravery shown here is unsurmountable. Her drive for sharing and understanding these stories will hopefully help someone in need of the right kind of push out the door.I want to shout “Trigger warnings and what some may consider spoilers,” but what if by doing so someone will miss out on an opportunity to get help? Shared situations breed understanding and solidarity. In reading this, someone may get the courage and insight needed to get up and get out.This is a story of abuse. This is a story of surviving. And this is a story of sharing in hopes of inspiring.Powerful, impactful, gut-wrenching, and brave. I want to hug you Colleen Hoover. This, THIS, is your defining moment as an author and as a person.Tanja~Original thoughts after reading May 2016... Powerful, impactful, gut wrenching and brave. I want to hug you Colleen Hoover.

This subject matter is something very important to me so this whole story was very near and dear to my heart. *cries ugly tears* Finally a CoHo book with substance and meaning and an important message...Full review to come.. Maybe, hopefully, if I have time!Edit: okay after reflecting on this a little more I've dropped my rating to four stars. I think I was eager because i thought the subject matter was handled so well... and while I did enjoy it I thought it had some characteristics of CoHo that have always bothered me... Really intense romantic relationship that moves way too fast (but I guess that's the whole point of her books haha) and really predictable plot... Still her best book yet that I've read!"

It's like when your teachers tell you not to put a compass near magnets because it will go crazy. My emotions are like that right now.Holy hell. After a week of binge watching Reign and procrastinating reading this, I finally sat down for two hours and became so invested in this book that a part of me still lives inside of it. It was amazing, it was perfect and I loved it.Warning for minor spoilers. Major spoilers will be tagged.

“Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen.”

It Ends With Us was not plot based, instead being very character driven, which I tend to enjoy more. I became so emotionally invested in all of these characters and I couldn't even hate them at the end. Colleen Hoover is amazing.The book follows the 24-year-old Lily Bloom, who grew up in an abusive household at the hands of her father. One day she meets Ryle Kincaid on an apartment rooftop, and cue the CHEMISTRY, before he disappears from her life for six months. Fast forward a bit, and Lily is opening her own floral business when she comes across a delightfully funny girl named Allysa (my idol). One thing leads to another (not the romantic variety) and then comes romance and love and quintessential Colleen Hoover heartbreak. I don't know why I ever both expecting otherwise.This book deals with some heavy topics like rape, abuse and domestic violence. Do not read it if you are triggered by such topics, but for me, It Ends With Us is a book I will never stop recommending. Colleen Hoover brings such a clear light to being trapped in an abusive relationship and loving your person too much to leave them and she completely changed my view on them. There's this point where Lily talks about how people are always pointing out how ""weak"" the abused are in the relationship, instead of focusing on how wrong the abuser is. I was so stunned by how true that is. 𝐒𝐏𝐎𝐈𝐋𝐄𝐑𝐒 𝐅𝐎𝐋𝐋𝐎𝐖I read comprehensive reviews before starting this book, so I knew ahead of time the negative development Ryle's character would take. At the beginning, I was honestly doubting how Colleen Hoover would pull it off. Ryle was so sweet and funny and snarky and I was truly loving him. But throughout the book, Ryle was explored so so well and the way he turns from a loving partner to an abuser was so perfectly followed through. I can't decide what to feel about his character. I hate him and I'm angry at him and I feel sorry for him and I'm proud of him for getting his closure. After his first anger explosion with the oven, I was so shaken and had to put down the book. And Lily's reaction to him and her initial decision that their love was stronger than Ryle's issues was honestly so real to me.When Ryle finally opened up to Lily about his history with his older brother, I was SO floored. I did not see it coming, AT ALL. In hindsight, that was a little dense of me, especially considering the first scene of the book, but that's Colleen Hoover for you.

“It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”

In the end, Lily's decision to leave Ryle to protect her child made me so so proud of her. I love how she came to the realisation that while Ryle loved her, he didn't love her the right way, the way she deserved to be loved. Lily is one of my new favourite characters; along with Allysa, who was on the list from the second she got her first line of dialogue.I got so emotional from this book. I was originally reading it in the kitchen next to my mum, and I had to leave to go to my room and cry in peace. Honestly, at this point my mum wouldn't even find it strange if I started sobbing in the middle of the kitchen, so I don't really know why I bother anymore. I'm a very emotional reader. The last sentence made me BAWL like an actual baby.If I could walk around with lines from this book printed on my clothes to force people to read them, I would. 

“You can stop swimming now, Lily. We finally reached the shore.”

"
1920,5.0,"5 ⭐ F*CK YOU Colleen Hoover⁠ ⁠. . . for taking me on this beautiful, raw, heartbreaking journey that tore my soul apart and loosely stitched it back together by the end.Trigger Warning (18+): This story features scenes with domestic abuse and sexual assault. There's also brief conversations about suicide. This book has changed and moved me in ways I can hardly begin to articulate. Not only was this my first CoHo book, but I also went in blind, so I was unprepared for this emotional rollercoaster. It's truly one of the most raw, honest, inspiring, and profoundly beautiful stories I've ever read. ⁠I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this. I wholeheartedly believe that everyone (men and women) over the age of eighteen should read this book. There are some powerful messages woven throughout the story that teach the reader many valuable things about life, love, and strength. 
Let's talk specifics:
This story addresses heavy topics that should be more openly discussed. Worldwide, almost one-third (27%) of women aged 15-49 years who have been in a relationship report that they have been subjected to some form of physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner. Domestic abuse and sexual assault may be uncomfortable topics to talk about, but if these issues aren't brought to light, how can we expect anything to change. I'm so proud of Colleen Hoover for writing this story - based on her and her mother's experience - and honored to be able to read it. *Please be sure to read the author's note when you finish the epilogue. But not before since it will contain spoilers.*Lily is one of the strongest female characters I've ever read about. And no, not in the cheesy superpowers kind of way, but mentally and emotionally. Lily grew up in a home with domestic abuse, and yet, she still has so much love in her heart and a willingness to be vulnerable. And when she ends up finding herself in a similar situation as an adult, she is strong enough to make some heartbreakingly difficult decisions. Yes, Lily struggles as any person would, but her determination, conviction, strength, and understanding are what make her the kind of person I want to be when I grow up. I admire her so much and can only hope her story provides strength to others in her situation. Writing this from Lily's POV made the story even more powerful. Because this is written in the first-person narrative, we experience everything Lily does. When she falls in love, we fall in love. When she experiences pain, we experience pain. When she struggles, we struggle. I promise you will feel many things: happiness, love, anticipation, rage, horror, shock, sadness, loneliness, loss, and so much more. Colleen Hoover, you are an evil genius, and I say genius because not every author can do this well. The journal entries were a unique and beautiful way to explore Lily's past. When I read the first journal entry, I rolled my eyes. I mean, it's addressed to Ellen Degeneres, and the whole concept seemed silly. But as we read more entries, I started to appreciate and look forward to the next one. It was the perfect way for us to get to know Lily as a teenager and truly understand her difficult situation at home as well as her first experience with falling in love. Atlas . . . the nicest fictional male character I've ever read about. I love this man. From the beginning, he is so thoughtful, sweet, and kind. He always puts Lily first and is just so grateful for her friendship. Every time I read about him in her diary, my heart wanted to explode. I mean, why couldn't I have met a perfect, cute homeless boy back in high school? lol *SPOILERS AHEAD*Ryle . . . my heart hurts for him. Okay, don't get mad at me for feeling sorry for him, but I mean, come on. It's tragic what happened to Ryle as a child. Plus, it's painful to see how much he loves Lily but how incapable he is of controlling his actions. It broke my heart the same way it broke Lily's hearing him sound so apologetic after every incident. How can 99% of Ryle be perfect, and then this 1% completely ruins everything? I'm NOT excusing anything Ryle does, but I can't help but see his story as tragic. He is destined to go through life alone (which he doesn't want) or as a domestic abuser (which he doesn't want). It's just sad. ""There is no such thing as bad people. We're all just people who sometimes do bad things."" This is such an important message to understand. We like to place people in boxes because it makes things simple, but the world isn't black and white. There are no heroes or villains, no good guys or bad guys. We are just people who do good things and bad things. This is a major theme throughout It Ends With Us and hopefully has you questioning your own beliefs.Allysa and Lily's friendship is absolute goals. I love their dynamic and how they support each other. When sh*t hits the fan in Lily's relationship, I thought Allysa would side with her brother Ryle, but instead, she surprised me:""As his sister, I wish more than anything that you could find a way to forgive him. But as your best friend, I have to tell you that if you take him back, I will never speak to you again.""That is what real friendship looks like.

1921,4.0,"TRIGGER WARNINGS: attempted rape and domestic violence. Also warning, this review has spoilers and I won't be marking them.
“It grew on its own,” I said. “Most plants do need a lot of care to survive. But some things, like trees, are strong enough to do it by just relying on themselves and nobody else.”
It Ends With Us was a book I didn't like at the beginning. I could see where it was going. I knew what would happen during the slow beginning as a relationship began to form between Ryle and Lily. I knew what was going to happen and at several times I had to stop due to both flashbacks and being overwhelmed by emotion. I'm not going to lay down my own personal experiences in this review, I don't see the point in that, so I will leave that at that. This book infuriated me for the beginning part. I hated the beginning of this book. I loved the diary entries that Lily had dedicated to Ellen DeGeneres about a boy, Atlas, she used to know. The boy who was her first love and the boy who motivated her to move to Boston once she finished college - as everything is better in Boston. I loved the relationship between Lily and Alyssa too. I loved Marshall as well. Ryle was my real problem. The first problem I had was his name, next his manipulative nature and three he was a straight up tool.
“Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn’t waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.”
I had a major problem with the character Atlas though. I understand the point of this book was Lily and overcoming her relationship, the admiration she had for her mum ultimately, ""I want to be like you when I grow up, Mom"", and how strong she was but I felt like we didn't get to know the new Atlas enough. We got the past, homeless boy that Lily fell in love for in diary entries to the one and only Ellen but all we know about present Atlas is that he's a chef, was in the marines, plays poker, and owns a house. I wanted more. I wanted Colleen to flesh him out a bit more instead of leaving him slightly flat. 
""We're all just people who sometimes do bad things.""
Abuse is the focal point of this book. The relationship between Ryle and Lily is one that develops, with abuse displayed in an incredibly realistic way. This book highlighted everything I'm afraid of in a future relationship and that was terrifying. It made me aware of my own personal fears and made me realise I need to rectify those before my decision to date seriously. I found their relationship infuriating in some parts, such as when they decide to go to Vegas to get married. I didn't like Rylee at all, but that's because he reminded me of so many people I have encountered in my life. I honestly didn't see his compassion though. I also hated how he tried to manipulate Lily by using the fact he murdered his brother by accident when they were younger, it felt like a bit of a cop out in the writing but it also made me gasp a little. It did not, however, make me care for him. I was afraid of him for a majority of the book and the emotions that were brought back scared me even more - which is why I gave this book a four stars instead of a three like I intended. Overall, this book is a heartbreaking novel. This is a story based on a real story even, which Colleen acknowledges in her ""Notes From the Author"". I can't even put in words what I thought about this book. This story made me sick, it made me cry, it in no way made me happy. It was raw. It was heartbreaking. It was inspirational. Lily's actions to the situation she was in are admirable and I am incredibly proud of this fictional character. I've cried like eight times writing this review so I need to stop. If you're looking for a book which will make you feel - this is the one for you. 
“I kiss her on the forehead and make her a promise. “It stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.”
EDIT: can we please acknowledge how dumb the name Lily Blossom Bloom is?EDIT 04/08/16: my mum is currently watching Ellen and she's talking about Finding Dory - which is ultimately just making me think about this book and screwing up my feelings again."
1922,4.0,"This review may contain a few minor spoilers.Truth be told, I would probably have given this book 2 stars if I haven't read the author's note at the end. The story was for me difficult to read and I just couldn't understand the main character's actions. But after reading the note, I understood and I now thank Colleen Hoover for spreading such an important message. What mostly put me off was that I was not expecting this kind of story at all. I was more expecting a romance novel, just like Ugly Love. Indeed, the story is really harsh and hard to read, because of the important topic of abuse. I don't know anyone who's even been in an abusive relationship so reading this book was hard. I thought Lily was just being stupid always going back to her husband when everytime he got mad he abused her. What really irked me though was that she saw the same thing happening to her mother and she wanted to call the police on her dad, yet she still finds excuses to forgive her lover when the only reason he got mad in the first place was because he was jealous? That just didn't make any sense to me. But now I get it. And that's why this story is powerful and that's why I recommend you to read it if you want to read a heart-wrecking love story. An ugly love story, but still a love story (pun not intended, I swear). Nonetheless, I give this book 4 stars because it's powerful, it spreads an important message and the plot was really addictive. I couldn't put it down and was always trying to guess what would happen next, between her abusive husband and her ex-lover who's back in her life. I actually really loved Atlas as a character, he really cares for Lily and that was just so sweet. The journal parts were also great, I loved to read about their meeting and their relationship. ""He was Marlin and I was Dory, and I was helping him swim."" These references throughout the whole book made me sob every. single. time. It was so addictive that when I told my non-reader boyfriend the story, we talked about it for like an hour because he wanted to know everything haha. He never does that I was so shook. Okay, back to the actual review. I used to love Ryle and I still love him a little, even though I cannot accept his behavior. Allysa was so so great! I loved her friendship with Lily and how she helps her out even though she's biased. Also, this book has so many great quotes I have a tab on like every two pages. Here are some of my favorites. ↠""I feel like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down we're all equal accounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others.""↠""This is just human nature, healing an old wound to prepare for a fresh new layer.""↠""What determines a person's character aren't the mistakes we make. It's how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.""↠""Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.""↠""Maybe love isn't something that comes full circle. It just ebbs and flows, in and out, just like the people in our lives.""Finally, when we finally understood the title, it just made me cry even harder. Just go read this book. It is so powerful, you won't regret it."
1923,5.0,this hurts too much
1924,5.0,"""There is no such thing as bad people. We're all just people who sometimes do bad things."" Everyone should read this book! It's incredibly realistic. The issue really gets pointed out in this one which, I think, is very important these days. Especially for young women like me. If you're a victim of domestic abuse, don't sit it out. Don't wait for help. You have to get it yourself. Be brave and look out for yourself. Because YOU (and your health), as an individual, should always come first!Okay, let's get a bit into detail: (view spoiler)[Lily and Ryle. Well, what can I say. It shocked me to see how quickly a human being could change, both in personality AND behavior. I respected Ryle as a character, but the things he did are inexcusable in my opinion. Sure, Ryle went through some tough shit in his past. But let me clarify one thing: What happened in the past  DOES NOT, justify NOR excuse his behavior towards Lily. IN NO WAY!!! If Ryle had possessed even a tiny fleck of responsibility, not only toward himself but everyone around him, he would've gotten help. As much as I wanted to stuff him in a bag and hurl him at the moon, I have to say that Ryle was quite understanding and empathetic at the end, concerning Lily, the baby and the things he'd done to her. Not everyone would've reacted like that. I mean, abusive relationship aside he seemed to care for her in a deep way which had me tearing up. Because, on the other hand, I felt so sorry for him. Not only did he shoot his own brother when he was six years old (his parents' fault btw) no, he actually felt deep regret about the whole situation. God Ryan, why did it have to be this way?! I still love you, but Lily made the right decision. Props to Lily that she called Atlas (who was the most precious!), spent several nights at his home, confronted Ryle and even had the courage to yell at him and tell him what she'd gone through because of him. I just, well done woman!  (hide spoiler)]"
1925,4.0,"Lily Bloom was raised in an abusive household so she's witnessed first hand what an abuser looks like. And, she never understood why her mother didn't leave her father. Lily's story begins on the day of her father's funeral. She's back in Boston, where she moved to put some distance from her hometown in Maine following her graduation from college, and has a chance meeting with Ryle Kincaid, a neurosurgeon with an allergy to relationships. While there was a mutual attraction, both knew their goals were polar opposites and went their separate ways until a bizarre set of events reconnected them. First, I consider this a contemporary fiction with romantic elements. It's a compelling look at domestic abuse from a unique perspective of a character who you'd think would know better. We often ask the question, ""why wouldn't she just leave?"" or some variation of that. Whether you agree or not with the points of view presented, the story does provide key insights as to why that decision may not be as easy a solution for the women involved. I liked how Lily's relationship with her first teenage love, Atlas Corrigan, was shared in retrospect through her reading of her journals. It was cleverly done and added an interesting element in how it was delivered. Her relationship with him helped provide definition to her character as well as provide a contrast to her subsequent one with Ryle. The author's post script gives important context for the story so I would encourage everyone to read/listen to her comments. I listened to the story and thought the narrator did a good job in distinguishing the characters and gave a solid performance. I liked this story, a lot, because I saw people I know personally in Lily and it's helped me better understand an issue I thought was less gray than actuality."
1926,2.0,"I'm Done!well,it wasn't that terrible to say the first but the theme behind the story is too way hard to stomach.and i am utterly perplexed why the heck i remained hooked up with it till the very end at firs place...and what made Collen to drag it too long to stand a single damn point to begin with?it could well be a short moral-story written for didactic purpose.....dont get me wrong for being as disparaging, it was really that awfulO Dear God the first 100 pages,i was about to believe i'll never get it overi like light-romances with heavy-lessons and(loades of ""SCENES"") sometimes but this one was really way more to cope with and too way monotonous.....every thing happening in novel as it progressed further was as-expected and guessable even to the readers with no prior idea whats it all aboutto say the least DONT GO FOR IT........not near to worth wasting time for!grow up Hoover,grow up!"
1927,5.0," 6 STARS..THIS.BOOK.THOUGH..When you hear Colleen Hoover has released a book, you just know that it's going to be Epic. Reviewing this is book is very hard without including spoilers..So my review is: I loved it, The End.."

1929,5.0,"5/5⭐I just have no words. 
“You’re only human. And as humans, we can’t expect to shoulder all of our pain.”
Check the TW before reading it!!! It deals with some heavy topics (I mention abuse and r@pe in my review!)  THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! I’m really glad TikTok prepared me for this book, telling me how sad and heavy it is because I would’ve cried a lot more if I didn’t know. Spilled two tears, one in one of Lily’s letters when she explains that her dad beat up Atlas. And the other one at the end, it was of happiness and relief. “For my father, who tried his very best not to be his worst. And for my mother, who made sure we never saw him at his worst.”Even from the start of the book, you could see this was gonna be a hard book. This dedication only made me feel sensible going into it. And that author’s note? 😔Plot: I don’t think this book has a specific plot, it’s generally about Lily’s life after witnessing her dad abuse her mom from a young age. The book starts when she meets Ryle and develops a serious relationship with him as we see some diary entries she made when she was a teenager that show her dad beating up her mom and her relationship with Atlas, a homeless kid that lived in the abandoned house next door. As her relationship with Ryle develops, we see him getting aggressive with her and there’s a pattern between her parents' relationship and her relationship with Ryle. Her father was abusive to her mom and then apologized and tried to make it up for weeks, just like Ryle. This book is about her seeing this pattern and making the right decision for herself. There are many obstacles along the way that make it hard, but she has people there to help her. At some point in the story, Atlas is back, working his dream job in his restaurant. He doesn’t want to disturb their relationship, but he is always there for whatever she needs. “All humans make mistakes. What determines a person's character aren't the mistakes we make. It's how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.”Characters: -Lily: she’s so strong and inspiring. Full of courage and determination. At some points, I was mad at her, not for staying, but for judging her mother and then doing the same thing as her. Lily is also a really compassionate person. It’s demonstrated multiple times, like when she helps Atlas by giving him food, letting him shower at her house, medicine, letting him sleep in her house when it was cold out… and she also shows this compassion to Ryle after he hurts her, over and over. Overall, I think Lily’s character was the best one to tell this story, she showed what a lot of girls go through. Being in an abusive relationship and still loving the person. “It takes an astronomical amount of pain and courage to disrupt a familiar pattern.”“Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen.”-Ryle: you know Colleen Hoover did an amazing job with his character when I can’t even hate him. I don’t like him, but I can’t hate him. I can’t. That’s how you know he was perfectly written. I thought he was creepy from the moment they met and he decided to take a picture of her. That was definitely a red flag. As more and more red flags started appearing I was like, please Lily, LEAVE HIM. HE SUCKS. But at the same time, I pity Ryle, I really don’t think he’s a bad person. I think his own trauma did a number on him when he was little. He said he has been going to therapy since he was six… I would find another therapist if I was him. Sometimes it even seemed as if he had two personalities like sometimes he would just suddenly stop and feel sorry, like that other side of him suddenly disappeared. I can’t hate him because he told us from the beginning: 
“There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”
And that scene at the hospital made me feel so bad for him. Yes, he deserved it and Lily made the right decision, but I believe that he didn’t mean anything of what he did. I’m glad that he got to realize that Lily deserved way better than him, and he understood everything she did.“What would you say to her, Ryle? Tell me. I need to know what you would say to our daughter if the man she loves with all her heart ever hurts her.”A sob breaks from his chest. He leans toward me and wraps an arm around me. “I would beg her to leave him,” he says through his tears”“I would tell her that she is worth so much more. And I would beg her not to go back, no matter how much he loves her. She’s worth so much more.”-Atlas: he’s my favorite person. He’s so compassionate. Compassionate Atlas. I just want to know so much about him, he’s the type of person that I would spend hours talking to, maybe he wouldn’t talk back but he would definitely listen to me and try to help me with my problems. I wish we knew more about him, we know he was in an abusive household but what exactly happened that made him run away? He went through so much too, I’m just glad he got to find a good home and that he achieved his dreams. So proud of him. He waited until he was worthy of Lily and they were both in a good place to be in a relationship. “In the future... if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again... fall in love with me.” He presses his lips against my forehead. “You’re still my favorite person, Lily. Always will be.”-Allysa and Marshall: literally love them. They were so much fun and so supportive. Underrated characters. “As his sister, I wish more than anything that you could find a way to forgive him. But as your best friend, I have to tell you that if you take him back, I will never speak to you again.”Romance: I have to say that I was always team Atlas, never really liked Ryle. He came off as creepy to me when he took a picture of her when they first met. And he talked about how he enjoyed watching a kid die to make the kid’s parents suffer… then I understood what he meant when he explained later in the book, but don’t tell me this doesn’t come off as creepy. Then their relationship started developing and I didn't hate it, they have a lot of chemistry. Getting married was so out of nowhere to me, like what? They had been dating for not so long and only known each other for a little over a year. And then more red flags started appearing… I understand why Lily stayed at first, but I’m so happy she left him for good. Ryle felt a lot of guilt, and I believe that he isn’t a bad person, but who is gonna tell you that he won’t do it again? He didn’t even let Lily explain to him that Atlas was only a friend and he almost raped her. “Just because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.”And Atlas… I need a novella of their relationship. That was NOT ENOUGH. Their relationship told in Lily’s diary entries is so good. How she took care of him when he was sick, gave him clothes, a place to shower… and she saved him. Like literally saved him. And then Atlas did the same with her, when she was in trouble with Ryle, he stepped up and helped her. And then waited for her, didn’t force her to make a decision. Just let her know that he was there for her. Let me make it clear that I don’t think Lily needed Atlas to leave Ryle, she did that all by herself, but Atlas was there. So yes, I love their relationship because they understand, support, respect, and love each other. That’s everything a healthy relationship should be. 
""You can stop swimming now, Lily. We finally reached the shore.”
I’ve never been so glad to not relate to a book, my heart goes out to all of you that related to this. No one should have to go through this. 
“Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.""

1930,2.0,i read this for a video and definitely have a LOT of conflicting thoughts on how i feel about this book. rtc
1931,5.0,"5+ ""Naked Truth"" Stars!

Wow! Well, now I see why I've read a fair amount of vague yet completely fan-girlish reviews for this book! It was astoundingly good and I didn't want it to end. I repeat- I did not want this book to end.From virtually the very start, I knew I was reading something special; a book that digs deep into our psyche and grabs hold of our hearts without letting go. So many life lessons were conveyed in these pages, I can't begin to list them all. From young love amidst personal and social strife, a deep connection was formed between Atlas and Lily. The homeless teen living in the dilapidated house across the street. The young Lily living in a home filled with demons and secrets. Both lonely in their own ways, reaching out for comfort, support, friendship...love. 

All humans make mistakes. What determines a person’s character aren’t the mistakes we make. It’s how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.

Several years later we meet Ryle Kincaid. The dashing, successful neurosurgeon Lily also connects with on a dark rooftop patio. A blip in time. A connection. A story. A love. 

Reading hundreds of books a year, most stories seem to all melt together. Their plots fairly common, results fairly predictable. In 
It Ends With Us,
 Colleen Hoover kept me riveted, feverishly turning the pages through all hours of the day and night. How do you want this story to end? I truly felt every ounce of the angst that was present within each and every character and my heart was holding onto hopes that no matter how it ended, it would end happily and how it should  end...

“Lily. Life is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn’t waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.”

Secondary characters Allysa and Marshall were such a great addition, adding a strong sense of friendship, family, and even comic relief. They make onesies for adults?This book is sure to be on my top ten list for 2016. Maybe Best of...ever. It's not all hearts and flowers. But it truly still is a love story...or more than one love story. Love isn't always patient. Love isn't always kind. But we love who we love and Colleen Hoover nailed the premise here. My heart seriously bled through for each character in this book. CoHo put her heart into this story and it pours out in the pages. And I thank her for sharing their story with me.

1932,3.0,"You can read this and all of my reviews at Lit·Wit·Wine·Dine.While I was very excited to begin reading this one and fully expected it to be four or five stars for me, I’m sorry to say that it didn’t live up. I knew this book was categorized as women’s fiction but it just felt extra-very chick-lit to me. The way in which the book was written felt very incongruent to the subject matter and what I believe was the author’s objective in writing the book. (I’m basing this on the Author’s Note at the end of the book which elicited more emotion from me than the actual book.)It wasn’t all bad though. Here’s what I think Colleen Hoover did well:Pacing – This was a quick and easy (in terms of language) read.Ryle’s character – She did a nice job in giving us a flawed but multidimensional character. I liked that she didn’t need to make one character “bad” and one “good”.Lily’s character – I think she did a great job getting to the heart of the difficulty women in Lily’s position have in making choices for themselves and their children. (Which was possible because of #2.)As for the ending, it was a good ending but predictable.This was the first book I’ve read by Colleen Hoover. I’ve come understand that she has a very loyal fan base. Though I can see why, I’m not sure I’m the right audience for her books.3/5 stars Thanks to Atria for providing me with a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.**This book contains detailed descriptions of domestic violence.**"
1933,3.0,"3 stars and I’m being generous I have 3 problems with Colleen Hoover’s books:1- the first part before the plot twist is very cheesy and boring and tired and I almost gave up on the book “Same happened with November 9 and ugly love”2- her books are kinda repetitive. they have the same pattern. 3- all her main characters from different books are the same. The idea of the book is great and I think it discusses a very important issue but the storyline is boring. I mean I didn’t love the book until I reached page 200 I guess I would have given this 2 stars if it weren’t for Lily’s brave decision which I know is the right onelastly, this will be the last book I’ll read by colleen Hoover so my journey with her ends her as well. so it end with us :) see what I did there? lol okay I’m sorry to all her fan but everyone is entitled to their own opinion but from now on I’ll start questioning the bookish taste of the people who like her books maybe because I’m not that big of fan of romance novels unless it was this really one of a kind story like “Me Before you” "
1934,5.0,"“We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things”The Naked Truth  I am a good person who had some bad things happen to. One bad thing I did to myself was to turn a blind eye on my own worth. For years. For my children. For my career. For my status. This novel has left me feeling empowered. More than my words or tears can express. Even when my tears dry the words of this book will stay with me forever. My wounds and heart can and will heal. I can forgive and I will forget. I'm gonna just keep swimming and continue healing. I am still one of my favorite persons.  My forgetting my worth was my bad thing that I did to deny that I was going to be a statistic. Now that I feel empowered : I seek the promised rainbows after my life's terrible storms. BRING IT. The key to my happiness, to all of our happy moments,  it ends with us. "
1935,5.0,I’m NOT crying! You’re crying! 😭😭😭 Such a beautiful story. I see why this book is so well loved. It was so much more than what I was expecting. The second to last chapter made me ball my eyes out! Colleen Hoover always manages to hit me in the heart with her books. 
1936,5.0,"in conclusion, this book made me cry. a lot. thanks Colleen Hoover for destroying the last bit of mental stability i thought i had 🤡"
1937,3.0,"I have a ridiculous name quota per book. It ends at one. This book had three. Lily Blossom Bloom, Ryle Kinsaid and…Atlas. Maybe those names should have been my first clue that it was time to put this one down and walk away. But I didn’t. I stuck this one through and finished it in a few short hours. A few short unhappy hours, sure. But I couldn’t just not read this one. I’m on a noble pursuit to not quite give up on Colleen Hoover yet. Her latest reads haven’t left a good taste in my mouth, but I guess I’m just hoping that she one day comes out with something resembling her earlier work. It Ends With Us, just wasn’t it for me. The themes and messages behind It Ends With Us are good. They’re great actually. Colleen Hoover writes at the back of the book that she meant for this story to educate, and It Ends With Us very much does that job. I won’t reveal any spoilers or details about the plot here or the overall story but the book does add a voice to an ongoing societal problem that is often ignored. It’s part of the reason why I don’t consider this one a romance as much as a cautionary tale and I give Colleen Hoover so much credit for tackling it. But alas, that wasn’t my problem with the book. It was everything else that bugged me. I guess my main issue with It Ends With Us is quite simple: I have a problem with simultaneous love stories. These aren’t the same as love triangles—those tend to happen at the same time. No, simultaneous love stories are two separate love stories a main character experiences with different people at different points in their life that gets told to the reader at the same time. Ugly love did this by having the female characters perspective explore the present with her current love while the male character explored the past with his ex. It Ends With Us takes a different approach and instead uses lily’s teenage diary entries to explain her first love (this was problematic for a number of reasons but more on that later). I tend to have a problem with this narrative for many reasons but really it can be just bottled down to one main point: how am I (the reader) meant to pick who to root for? And to be honest, I understand that this is the reason this literary technic is used. The author wants me to connect and understand the main characters struggle with her love life. But this technic fails by the same reason it exists. It’s sole purpose is to create tension and angst, only the inclusion of the “past love” whose story gets told simultaneously along side the main character meeting her “new love” takes away that tension and angst. The new guy obviously doesn’t hold a candle to the old guy, the original first love. So the past love wins. Because if he didn’t…why would he be included in the first place? Why wouldn’t the story just stay in the present?It felt like Lily’s relationship with Atlas could have been one book, and her relationship with Ryle could have been a different one. Sure, there are obvious points where both romances intersect and I guess Lily’s past wouldn’t make a hundred percent sense without Atlas’ introduction (at the very least) but in the grand scheme of things, and I know I am in the minority in this, but I just felt it was sort of a cop out. (view spoiler)[It was like the story couldn’t end without giving Lily a romance…one that stuck. And that’s where Atlas came in. (hide spoiler)]I guess it’s pretty obvious from the synopsis alone which boy is the first love and which boy is the current one, so I don’t feel too bad admitting that I was quite happy with how Colleen Hoover handled the themes surrounding one particular character who plays the bigger role in the story. But even with that acknowledged, I still felt like his character wasn’t fully developed. TRIGGER WARNING:(view spoiler)[Ryle is abusive. His character arc largely focuses on his relationship with Lily and how their picture perfect relationship in the blink of an eye turns abusive. The topic is a personal one for Colleen (she says so at the end) and I felt like for the most part, the scenes where Lily really begins to question her relationship with Ryle and his behaviour were very well done. But we get a rather poor excuse midway through the book as to ""why"" he is the way he is, and while I believe that if it had been explored thoroughly and with more care, it could have been very effective in adding another layer to the story,it simply wasn't. And considering the fact that none of the marketing (or the synopsis)  alludes to the fact that this is a domestic violence book, it felt like a twisted plot point.  (hide spoiler)]But I also feel like underdevelopment is just another recurring theme for all the characters in the story. They all had some sort of sob story, each and every one, and none of them really get the light of day. But aside from the cringe worthy character names, the simultaneous love story and the underdeveloped character arcs, there is still one more thing I have to mention…Ellen DeGeneres. Don’t get me wrong, I love Ellen. If I could choose five people living or dead to invite to a dinner party, she would undoubtedly be one of them. But even me, with my intense admiration for her as a person, couldn’t handle all the cringe worthy Ellen scenes and mentions in this book. I even cringed at the name, “Dory” at one point. Lily addresses her ""diary"" entries to Ellen and while this idea in theory might sound cute, I found it deeply disturbing.  It Ends With Us felt like it tried to tackle every emotional hang up out there—without really giving much attention to any of them but the main one. But even that felt overshadowed at times by the messy romance and endless clichés. I don’t doubt this isn’t my last Colleen Hoover book, if only because of how quick her reads are, but I still hold out hope, that the magic I read in her earlier books, returns soon. "
1938,5.0,"5 solid, mind-blowing CoHo stars!ARC generously provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. This has got to be one of the best written books I’ve ever come across. That may sound like hyperbole but it isn’t. The very first thing I said to myself when I finished this story was “this was really amazing” and “I will never forget this story”. And in the middle of the book, all I could think of is how invested I was in the story from the get go and how I couldn’t wait to get back to it. It was absolutely unputdownable which is a true sign of any great book. Am I surprised? Not really. This is Colleen Hoover we’re talking about after all. And this book is up there with my favorite story by her, Hopeless. I’m not going to spoil ANYTHING about this book because my sincere hope is that people go into it blind. I dove in not knowing a single detail and I honestly think that enhanced my experience. It’s extremely difficult reviewing this book without giving anything away that could potentially steal from the surprises and the twists and turns. You just have to experience it, and that is actually very adequate to the subject matter as well. It will resonate with you differently, depending on your past and current experiences.All I can say is, if you like Colleen Hoover, this is probably not going to disappoint. She tells this story, about an extremely sensitive topic, with the skill of a virtuoso. Her degree of precision at developing the plot and the characters in a very relatable way is impressive to say the least. Because of the underlying theme and the subject matter, this could have been a train wreck of epic proportions. It’s anything but. The first half may have you worried, I know it worried me. I didn’t really like Ugly Love and I thought this was probably going to be similar to that, but this is a book where I highly recommend sticking it out. The emotional payoff is more than worth it. If you’re a feminist, this is an amazing book to both have and to share. If you’re an aspiring author, this is a book that is worth studying for how well the twists were laid out and the storytelling techniques employed. If you’re a CoHo fan, this will probably hit all the sweet and tender spots. If you’re an emotional reader, this might just make you cry, if you’re a parent, this is a must have and must pass down to your children, and if you’re just in need of a good, satisfying book, this is all you could want. As a romance reader, I have to say this book is so much more than just a romance. It’s relevant and important, and I’m so happy I read it. The title, when it finally appears in the book, was beyond emotional, it was powerful. And the cover makes all the artistic sense in the world now. If this review is frustrating for how little information I’m giving you, then all I can say is you have to read the book!The powerful theme is true about most of Colleen’s books. They are significant. They aren’t run of the mill, cookie cutter romances and that’s probably the reason why she’s one of the very few romance writers that has crossed into the mainstream literary world. Her books aren’t ´prurient and shallow. They are special, original and daring. She makes them brave and bold. 	5 stars all the way for me.http://tbbsisterhood.comFor boook reviews, prizes and more!"
1939,5.0,"Les recomiendo a todos que como yo inicien este libro sin saber previamente nada de él.
SPOILERS
Recuerdo cuando era una niña y veía historias de abuso en televisión o películas y yo pensaba ¿por qué esa mujer es tan tonta?, ¿por qué se queda con él?, si alguien me hiciera algo así jamás lo perdonaría, pero últimamente he conocido personas que estuvieron en esa situación y ahora Collen nos comparte su experiencia con el abuso, cada historia es diferente, igual que las personas no hay dos iguales y ahora lo que me pregunto es ¿de verdad podría irme?, ¿seré lo suficiente mente valiente y fuerte para hacerlo? Me gusta pensar que si, pero ahora ya no juzgo a las personas que fueron o son abusadas, ahora solo rezo por ellas y porque encuentren su propia fortaleza. “Los ciclos existen porque son dolorosos de romper. Se necesita una cantidad astronómica de dolor y valentía para interrumpir un patrón familiar. A veces parece lo más fácil solo seguir corriendo en los mismos círculos familiares, en lugar de enfrentar el miedo e saltar y posiblemente no aterrizar de pie.”No sé ni cómo empezar a hablar de esta novela, pero si tuviera que definir esta novela con una palabra elegiría decir “triste” y es que la situación es de lo más triste, entiendo todo el amor que sentía por Ryle y lo mucho que deseaba perdonarlo, creo que eso es lo que más duele del libro, que yo abria actuado igual que ella, lo habría perdonado esa primera vez y todos sabemos cómo terminó eso. Yo también me enamore de Ryle y su coqueteo inicial, la persona que era en sus buenos momentos, pero a veces las personas nos son todo lo que aparentan, tal vez ni ellas lo sepan pero la mamá de Lilly tiene razón y si alguien que te violenta de verdad te amara te dejaría ir y te pediría que nunca regresaras a su lado. Y luego tenemos a Atlas que después de superar su pasado y salir adelante no fue lo suficientemente valiente para reconocerse a sí mismo y ponerse a la altura de Lilly. Como dije antes todo fue simple y sencillamente triste, un libro sumamente honesto y crítico, que recomendaría para todos aquellos que como yo cuando era una niña tuvimos la fortuna de no experimentar nada tan terrible en nuestras infancias y poder comprender, a los que se encontraron y de encuentran en tan terrible situación."
1940,5.0,"find the full review at https://myriadinklings.com/2016/08/05.... :)It Ends With Us is one of those books that you will remember. You will reach the end of the book and put it down. Yet, thoughts of this book, the characters and the message will continue to linger on your mind for days after you finish, maybe even weeks.It Ends With Us is not for everyone, but it speaks a courageous message that I highly commend CoHo for being brave enough to write about. Although it is beautiful work, it might be hard for some to enjoy it due to raw honesty. Sometimes, things that are so real are hard for us to comprehend, but it is this exact message she writes about that really brings it home for me.This book made my heart ache… it may be an exaggeration, but I feel like this book has left a little mark on me. I feel like it’s changed me, my perspective…It Ends With Us is one of the works that leaves you a little devastated, like a little part of me died after finishing this book, (in a good way that only really special books can have the power to do). I don’t know how you do it, Colleen Hoover, but thank you for writing this book. Thank you.Here’s a naked truth: pick up a copy of It Ends With Us because you will not regret it.-----Colleen Hoover does it again. Review coming soon."
1941,5.0,This book is still just as powerful and incredible as the first time I read it. 
1942,3.0,"Looking for distractions. Not as cheesy as the cover and title suggests but after reading some of my GR friend reviews, I was hoping for more."
1943,5.0,"5 unforgettable stars 
“You are my world, Lily. My world.”
Nothing…and we mean, nothing…could have prepared us for how this story unfolded. You know a book has affected you when you finish it and sit there numb, unable to even contemplate moving until you’ve processed all the intricacies of the emotional, unforgettable and extraordinary story you’ve been privy to. When, a day later, you catch yourself staring into space thinking about the characters you’ve loved, their situation and their outcome as though you’ve experienced every aspect of the story on some personal level. And then…. struggling to find the words to adequately convey your feelings when all you really want to do is grab every reader and yell, READ this book! When, no matter how emotionally battered you feel, you want readers to experience the pain and courage it took this author to put down her words for us to share.That’s exactly how we feel after reading It Ends With Us. The naked truth? This story wasn’t anything we expected but so much more than we could have asked for. We were left overloaded with emotion at the intensity and direction Colleen Hoover took us in with Lily’s story. This is the Colleen Hoover we love, the lady whose words are like a warm, comforting hug one minute, a kick to the heart the next.
“I love you, Lily. Everything you are. I love you.”
It took guts to write this story because as heartbreaking as it was for us to read it, we can only guess what it took for Colleen Hoover to reach into her heart and bring this book to life. This is an author with the incredible talent to weave a story that left us questioning ourselves, our thoughts and our feelings and with It Ends With Us, Colleen Hoover deserves all the accolades this story will bring.We (fairly or unfairly) placed Colleen Hoover on a pedestal years ago. She’s way up there as far as authors go and we have come to expect the unique and the phenomenal from her. It’s hard not to when she is responsible for books such as: Slammed, Point of Retreat, Hopeless and Maybe Someday. These are the sort of books we treasure and don’t get to experience as often as we’d like.We liked, but didn’t love the last two books we read by Collen. They felt a little ‘safe’ for want of a better word. We know this author, we know what she’s capable of and those two books fell a little short of our expectations, but that’s our opinion and we know others loved them. We were worried our love affair with Colleen’s writing was over and that, readers, would have been a travesty. It Ends With Us has broken that voodoo and we couldn’t be happier…despite having tears streaming down our faces.
“How far would you go, Lily?”“I don’t know.”
Some have told us this is a huge departure for Colleen Hoover but we disagree. This, this is the sort of story we always knew Colleen Hoover would one day deliver. Now we understand the posts we’ve seen from her stating how difficult this book was to write and how much it took out of her because reading it tore us to pieces. We loved these characters with every beat of our hearts so when they hurt, you can bet we hurt too. This one hit us hard. Personally it resonated with us in ways we’d rather it didn’t and would love to forget.Colleen Hoover dug deep for this book and It Ends With Us is testament to how Colleen has grown as an author in the last four years because this story is remarkable, different, honest, heartbreaking and at times agonizing reading. This is not an easy book to get through but by God, it’s rewarding.
“Someone once told me that there is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”
There is so much we’d love to tell you about this book. We’d love to sift through the layers, the complexities, the sheer emotion of the story, but we won’t because the surprise element is what makes this story so palpable and only an author can tell their story. What we will say is that Colleen Hoover sideswiped us big time, many times and that synopsis doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface of what you’ll find between the pages of this book. The significance of the title had us in tears.Reliving Lily’s youth was particularly difficult for us both. It was a personal journey we understood implicitly and it hurt to read. We were Lily and that was punishing for us both. In true Colleen fashion, though, she delivers this part of Lily’s story in an imaginatively warm way that had us both tearing up and giggling, our hearts overflowing with warmth as much as dread. Oh how we loved the courageous Lily Bloom. We championed her, we understood her and we felt for her every step of the way from her younger years to present as we lived Lily’s journey.‘Imagine all the people you meet in your life. There are so many. They come in like waves, trickling in and out with the tide. Some waves are much bigger and make more of an impact than others. Sometimes the waves bring with them things from deep in the bottom of the sea and they leave those things tossed onto the shore. Imprints against the grains of sand that prove the waves had once been there, long after the tide recedes.’If you’re a person who shies away from heartbreaking stories or who shuns anything resembling a love triangle (this is not a love triangle) and you allow those feelings prevent you from picking up this book, you’ll be kicking yourselves because this is one of the best reads of this year. We can’t urge you enough to take a step outside of your reading bubble and trust this author to guide you with her beautiful, honest, heartbreaking and raw words. This story demanded to be told, we feel it demands to be read, and as we sit here with tears streaming down our faces, we know we won’t be forgetting this experience any time soon.

1944,5.0,"بعد از خوندن این کتاب، دقایق زیادی به صفحه ی سفید روبروم خیره شدم تا جمله‌ای که باید ریویوی این کتاب رو باهاش شروع کنم رو پیدا کنم؛ اما تنها چیزی که پیدا کردم رودخونه ی اشک‌ توی چشم‌هام بود‌. انگار که بارون باریده باشه. انگار که رعد و برق بزنه توی قلبم.
“I feel like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down we’re all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others.”
کم پیش میاد حرف کم بیارم؛ همیشه برای ریویو نوشتن بدون اینکه خودم بدونم چطوری، شروع به تایپ می‌کنم و کلمات سرازیر میشن. اما حالا و بعد از این کتاب، انگشتام بعد از هر کلمه خشک میشن و باید برگردم به اول جمله: ""چی می‌گفتم؟!"" و دارم مدام فکر می‌کنم؛ چی بگم؟ از کجا شروع کنم؟بزارید از اولش شروع کنم؛ لی‌لی بیست و سه سالشه، و با رایل آشنا میشه. و همین. تمام لذت این کتاب در غافلگیری‌های نفس گیریه که خشک‌تون می‌کنه. پس چرا این لذت رو ازتون بگیرم؟
Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.
این قصه یه قصه ی غم‌انگیزه، یه غم‌انگیز نفس‌‌گیر. در عین‌حال، شخصیت‌هایی داره که نمیخوان غم تمام زندگی‌شون و این کتاب رو پر کنه. پس باید بگم یه غم‌انگیزِ پر از امیده. این قصه، یه ترکیب تلخِ از غم‌ و شادی.‌ از چرخه ی غیرقابل انکار غمگینی و خوشحالی؛ از غمی که توی صف ایستاده تا نوبتش که شد جای تمام شادی رو بگیره؛ جوری که انگار هیچوقت هیچ خوشبختی‌ای اونجا نبوده.همراه این کتاب زندگی‌ای رو خوندم که شاید آینده ی خودم باشه. نه یه شباهت کامل؛ اما یه شباهت کوچیک از جرئت دل کندن از چیزی که همزمان هم عاشقشی و هم آزارت میده. که کی می‌دونه؟ شاید آینده ی خیلی‌ها باشه. و من از اول کتاب‌ لی‌لی بودم، لی‌لی رو از نزدیک خوندم و دیدم و حالا یه زندگی پُرِ تجربه به زندگی‌هایی که از خوندن کتاب‌ها تجربه کردم اضافه شد. ولی‌ حس می‌کنم این‌بار این تجربه خیلی متفاوت‌تره، و واقعی‌تر.
Fifteen seconds. That’s all it takes to completely change everything about a person.
میون جملات این کتاب دختری رو دیدم که عاشق شده، که ترسیده، که متنفره، دلتنگه، و همچنان عاشق‌. میون صفحات این کتاب احساسات نابی رو دیدم که حتی نتونستم لحظه‌ای شک کنم که غیرواقعیه، و حالا در پایان کتاب می‌خونم که پایه و اساس این احساسات قبلا توسط خود نویسنده تجربه شده. و باور کردم که حسم غلط نبود، که تمام این‌ها زیادی واقعی‌ان، زیادی نزدیکن. لی‌لی بعنوان راوی، زیادی نزدیکه و این یعنی شما قراره تمام احساساتی که لی‌لی تجربه خواهد کرد رو تجربه کنید، شاید حتی دردناک‌تر تجربه کنید.عشق مفهوم خیلی عجیبیه. مفهومی که شاید همه دوست داریم تجربه‌ش کنیم؛ و دوست دارم بگم قسمت قشنگ‌تر عشق، اینه که ببینی طرف مقابلت دوست داشتنت رو چطور بلده. و خود تو چقدر دوست داشتن بلدی؟بیاید باهم اعتراف کنیم که گاهی دلمون لک میزنه برای دوست داشته شدن؛ برای خواسته شدن، برای دیده شدن؛ جوری که هیچ‌کس تابه‌حال ما رو اون‌طور ندیده. تاحالا دلمون نخواسته؟ که بالاخره حس کنیم یه گوشه از زیر این آسمون بزرگ جاییه که قراره حس کنیم ما هم بهش تعلق داریم.ولی تمام این کتاب همین‌جا و زیر همین گوشه ی قشنگ و جادویی آسمون تموم نمیشه. چون زندگی هیچوقت این‌قدر خوب و مهربون نبوده.
Just because someone hurts you doesn’t mean you can simply stop loving them. It’s not a person’s actions that hurt the most. It’s the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.
زندگی ما آدما، پرِ از حقایقی که فقط و فقط خودمون ازشون خبر داریم. از حقایقی که فقط متعلق به خودمونه، که به هیچ‌کس نگفتیم. اما این کتاب بهم یادآوری کرد که گاهی اون‌قدر یه حقیقتی رو‌ پیش خودت نگه می‌داری که باورت نمیشه اون حقیقت میتونه از سینه‌ت بیرون بیاد و توسط شخص دیگه‌ای شنیده بشه. به خودم که نگاه می‌کنم می‌بینم حقایق زیادی هست که فقط پیش خودم نگه‌شون میدارم، حقایقی که اگه برهنه بشن برای روح‌مون بهتره و سبک میشیم.و ته تهش، به عنوان قشنگ و دوست‌داشتنی کتاب فکر کردید؟ همه‌چیز با ما تموم‌ میشه. با افکار ما، با تصمیم ما و چیزی که برای زندگی‌ خودمون می‌خوایم و‌ می‌سازیمش. فقط باید تا دیر نشده یاد خودمون بندازیم که این حس گیر افتادن و این حس محدودیت، فقط یه حسه، یه تلقینه. فقط باید یاد خودمون بندازیم که از پسش برمیایم.
And then I smile even bigger, because isn’t that what it’s all about? Sacrificing for the person you like so that you can see them happy?

1945,4.0,"I need to stop editing this but I want to emphasise that I did LOVE atlas and lily. I literally physically felt their chemistry and I have heart eyes for them and I cannot stop thinking about them, that’s all. Okay okay, if you happened to be on goodreads at 3:00am last night you probably saw me saying “I’m sobbing from disappointment I hate how this turned out”.. and I stand by that. However, I’ve slept on it and now I can better articulate my feelings on this. So, it’s going to be 4 stars. This was looking like 5 stars most of the book but towards the end, once I realised how Colleen was going to execute the direction she was taking with it I knew my rating would be lowered.First of all, how the hell did this book win best romance a few years ago and how the hell is it marketed as one? Yes, Atlas and Lily. However I’d argue the main storyline actually happening is Ryle and Lily’s (abusive) relationship. So, I’m honestly a bit weirded out that this is marketed as a “love triangle”. I get the shock value of Ryle physically hurting Lily was supposed to play a part in this to show the shock Lily herself felt, but I personally think when it comes to things like domestic abuse readers and viewers need a trigger warning/disclaimer beforehand. Secondly, this sort of ties into my first point. I wanted to see more balance in the “love triangle”. Apart from the few flashback chapters of Atlas and Lily we got and the few scenes of them in the present, in my opinion most of the focus in this book was definitely on Ryle and Lily. However this wasn’t a problem for me throughout the majority of this book because I thought that Lily and Atlas would have more time together towards the end, but they didn’t. I get that perhaps wasn’t the direction Colleen Hoover wanted to take because her authors note basically tells you that she wanted this story and Ryle and Lily’s story to in some ways mirror her own personal experience with her parents. This of course isn’t a problem however I really wish this book didn’t try and mislead you into thinking it’s a love triangle and a romance whenever it’s clearly a story about Lily’s experience with domestic abuse, at least that’s the forefront. Thirdly, in the epilogue it doesn’t mention anywhere that Ryle is even in therapy or getting professional help and this disappoints me and is the actual reason why I was crying from disappointment. He assaulted her multiple times and even tried to rape her, I get that having a baby could change him however if he really wanted to change for the better and if Colleen really wanted a good redemption arc for him then I think mentioning professional help would have sent a better message.This might be the longest review I’ve ever written.. btw, not done.🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩So, I want to talk about Ryles character. He was a massive piece of shit FROM THE START yet no one seems to talk about that, or the massive red flags.Lily and Ryle meet and from the start he says he wants to literally fuck her. She says no. He continues to touch her breasts until he gets a call from work and needs to leave. Then, he proceeds to take a photograph of her without so much as asking her. Their paths cross as Lily becomes close unintentionally with his sister. However, Ryle does NOT back off. He legitimately BEGS Lily to have sex with him even though she continues to tell him no.We later find out Ryle, again without so much as asking Lily, hung the picture he took of her whenever they first met IN HIS HOUSE.🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩So, to conclude. I really loved this book for the most part however I think parts of the execution were a bit messy. I also think it’s synopsises are misleading and should have had a domestic abuse disclaimer. Also again, really wanted more focus of Atlas and Lily. When I think of them and their flashbacks they’re kind of an OTP now? I cried for them multiple times and could physically feel their chemistry, their relationship is 5 stars. Wow, I’m actually quite proud of this review."
1946,5.0,"I still can't get this book out of my mind and I'm sure I never will. This review will be spoiler-free since I do want all of you who haven't read it yet to start it having no idea at all about it.First off, I'd like to thank Colleen Hoover for writing this book. I'm more than happy this book exists and I think every single person out there should read it. I read the author's note and it broke me, so I applaud Hoover's bravery for writing it. The book was important to her and I want her to know that it was just as important to me.I was one of those people who didn't understand and this book changed my perspective and the way I think towards the subject matter. That's why this book is so important. This book changed my life.I've read almost all of Hoover's books (excluding the novellas, Point of Retreat and This Girl) and she is hands down one of my favorite authors out there, and it's safe for me to say I know the style and the themes of her books; however, It Ends with Us, was not, in any way, like her other books. I started this book thinking one thing, and it turned out to be the complete opposite. I felt all sorts of emotions as I read this book. It made me laugh, it made me cry my eyes out and it made me angry. It was one those perfect books and without a doubt, it's one of my favorite books. I can't stress enough how important this book is. How educational, raw, real and powerful it is. Lily is hands down my favorite Colleen protagonist. She's real, vulnerable, strong and smart. She was conflicted, she suffered and she felt. She's human. She was smart and she knew how to deal with everything. I cheer her for her decision at the end of the book. I've always loved Colleen's writing and always thought it was perfect. However, what was so special about this book to be specific is that I  felt  with Lily. I really did. I felt I was Lily and I felt like I was making the decisions and I was feeling what she was feeling. That's how you know the author's great, when she can make you feel with her character. I was hurting when she was hurting, laughing when she was laughing, feeling vulnerable when she was feeling vulnerable, feeling conflicted when she was feeling conflicted and feeling strong when she was feeling strong.You will fall in love with the characters and you will be frustrated with some of them, but you will still love them despite it all.  ""There's no such thing as bad people. We're all just people who sometimes do bad things.""  This quote in the book pretty much sums up the entire book for me and kept being repeated in my mind as I was reading. I’m sure it’s one of those quotes that will stick with me always. This book will tear your heart out and will leave you feeling empty. This book is a masterpiece, one I'll never forget.Again, every single person out there should read it."
1947,3.0,"Naked Truth?: I enjoyed this book but I preferred “Maybe Someday”... and I may be biased because in ""Maybe Someday"" the main characters name is Sydney :) such a beautiful name. Haha.This book wasn’t the best book I’ve ever read but I’ve gained knowledge and a new perspective. (Tell me which Colleen Hoover book should I read next please because I love her writing style).I am crying sooo much after that ending. (view spoiler)[ Naming their baby after his brother, my heart hurts. Then after when Lily ask Ryle what he would do if his daughter was in her position. Since Ryle let her go does that mean that he loves her (based on what Lily’s mom says)? (hide spoiler)]. Now we know why the book is titled “It Ends with Us”. I am not one who reads book synopsis because I rarely want to know many details about a book. Therefore, all I knew about this book is that it was a love story that had triggers of abuse. Little did I know how much this book would impact me. (view spoiler)[ With that halfway through the book I was devastated when a Ryle pushed Lily because I thought that the only abuse was Lily’s parents, so I was shocked. After the second push, I was prepared because I knew Ryle was going to find the paper with Atlas’s number but Ryle’s reaction was not expected. It was so manipulative of Ryle. It’s like he didn’t freak out right away the second time he pushed her because he trapped her in a marriage. I felt so bad for all of the physical, mental, and emotional abuse Lily went through. By the end of the book, I felt for both Lily and Ryle. Can you imagine killing your own brother as a kid because your parents kept a gun in the house in a non-safe place without the safety on? That is traumatizing. I am just happy that his family is still there for him and loves him.  (hide spoiler)]I was not a fan of the Ellen letters because it was just strange? I’m not sure what word to use. But it is one reason why I don’t like contemporary because who will Ellen be in 50 years when I reread or someone else reads it? Haha.I love Atlas and would love a story about when he left to join the military and when he was living in his household. Please, can we get one Colleen Hoover!! I would’ve liked it if there was more Atlas (especially at the end, the end felt a little rushed).P.S.: I highly recommend everyone to read the authors note at the end (I never read them, but trust read this one)."
1948,1.0,"Yeah.....I didn't like this book. 
At. All.
 Not even a little bit. First one of her books that I seriously did not like. It wasn't the subject matter (for example (view spoiler)[SKALS is one of my favorite book series (hide spoiler)]), and it wasn't the characters (I can get over that for a good plot-line). It was the story itself. Now don't get me wrong I absolutely LOVE her work but this....I mean I get the ""It Ends With Us"" and the whole point/message. But I just did not like it. Was not into this story nor could I become invested even partially other than the frustration I felt with this book. The synopsis was very misleading. The writing was choppy for the most part. This story didn't pull me in, it was basically like reading ""how to"" directions for me......Not even joking about it. That is how shallow it felt. It was just there, lying about, not doing much of anything. Nothing was ever explained really. I mean it told but it never showed. Ryle and Lily meet, fast forward they date, fast forward they marry, fast forward..... Atlas is great, loved him (view spoiler)[except for the whole passivity that was his love life (hide spoiler)], but he had such a small insignificant amount of time in this book it was pitiful. And he was the best daggone part. He was the only reason I kept reading the book. I should have quit while I was ahead because he only took up about two full chapters if you combined it all. What was even the point of him being in it? It started out good with his whole introduction and then it went NO FUCKING WHERE. Again, not kidding. He was literally non-existent in this book. So.....here I am ending this book with anger and disappointment. Yes....you read that right. Don't feel like explaining anymore. "
1949,4.0,"
It's currently 11 pm and I'm crying a lot.
So, this book should definitely come with Huge Trigger Warnings for Abuse and Attempted Rape. As well as talk about Attempted Suicide and Self Harm. But.My feelings for this book are absolutely all over the place. In the beginning, I was bored and just blegh like this is a normal romance book whatever. And the middle came around and we go back in time and I was enjoying it a bit more and then it died again to me and I was getting annoyed. But then last 100 pages are some of the most heart wrenching, gut-punching pages I've ever read. And by the last sentence of the Epilogue, I was dead. Just Dead. I honestly don't think I've read a book that had me this all over the place with feelings. From going to liking to hating to liking to hating and then loving was just draining. And I'm pretty sure I gave Amber a headache by the number of times my opinion kept changing and I kept texting her about it all LOL. After this one, I really am interested in more of her books, hopefully, one of them isn't so heavy and just fluffy, I could really go for something light right about now. I should have a full review on this soon, I just started working again so I need to fit my blog life into work life as well as reading life. It's a hassle LOL. \\\\\My first ever CoHo read! I was going to start with something else but Amber shamed me so here I am.This cover is stunning tho so I hope the inside is too 🤞🏽🙆🏽‍♂️"
1950,5.0,"“In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.” He presses his lips against my forehead. “You’re still my favorite person, Lily. Always will be.”I don't know how I am so happy and so very very sad at the same time?? Closing the last page of this and putting her back on my shelf was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do. No words can ever do this book justice. And since I can't give you a review, here's just a snippet of my text messages with my besties who comforted me throughout this whole book (shoutout to you both <3).""the ending was perfectI couldn't ask for anything betterbut somehow I still feel like staring at the wall for the next 6 hours and crying.""And to stay true to my words to them, that's exactly what I'm going to do once I post this review. **Thank you Lily and Maisie so so so so much for being there for me the whole time I read this. I would probably have drowned in my sorrows without you both (but I'm still going to do that anyway). Sending the two of you the biggest virtual hug ever. I love you both <3**And that's it my friends. Stay tuned for the next episode of ""Rhi's Problems she Brings Upon Herself"" where I decide to read a book I know, will make me sob. willingly."
1951,5.0,"This is way more than a 5 five star.""Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.""This book out of all the one I have read made me view life in another perspective and changed my life for the better and no words can express how much I loved it. Not only did it hurt but this made me believe in love but above all soulmates. As the cover of the books say “every person with a heartbeat should read this book”.Also I always forget to mention it but if you are planning on reading this book please read the author note once your done with it. The book overall was already emotionally something but the author note will just be your last straw and your breaking point."

1953,4.0,"It Ends with Us is an amazing, emotional, sweet, captivating, unique and poignant novel. There were so many things that I loved in this book, like Lily, the secondary characters that made me laugh sometimes, the letters and the meaning of the title.

1958,5.0,Finally got this out of my bookshelf to read and I couldn't be more glad that I did. This book sparkled so many emotions and inspired me to look at imperfections from a completely new perspective! I can't say that I'm surprised at how touched I am emotionally and mentally by this read since it's Colleen FREAKING Hoover! Yet again making me fall with every imperfect and perfect character she brings to life! Also what kind of name is Atlas? It's definitely going to be my Husky name if I ever get to adopt one! I'm in love!!“In the future... if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again... fall in love with me.”
1959,5.0,"4,5 ""continue a nadar"" estrelasQuerida Colleen, Sou sua fã desde... sempre. Amo seu trabalho e, no quesito romance, ""Maybe Someday"" ainda é meu favorito. Entretanto, IT ENDS WITH US é o livro mais honesto, mais emotivo e mais real que você escreveu. Na verdade, nenhum dos seus livros - tirando os escritos com a Tarryn - fogem da realidade. Só que esse deu pra sentir em cada linha o tanto que você estava abrindo seu coração ali. Se eu fosse definir esse livro, não diria que o romance é o forte dele. Diria que é um livro necessário para nós mulheres. Em tempos de discussão sobre o empoderamento feminino, o assunto discutido aqui é de extrema importância para qualquer mulher que viveu - ou não - situação parecida. Esse livro é uma lição de vida. Você conseguiu esconder bem o assunto do livro, porque eu sinceramente não tinha ideia que seria assim. Achei que iria ser uma história com triangulo amoroso em que a mocinha ficaria na dúvida com qual cara ficaria e no final ela escolhia um. Ah! Como eu fui enganada! Apesar de ter um Ryle e um Atlas não tem nada de triangulo amoroso. Mas o leitor sofre e sofre e sofre muito por eles - sim, pelos dois - pela história de vida deles. Pelo passado deles e pelo presente. Você enganou também porque a gente acha que tá tudo tranquilo e favorável e ai quando a gente percebe o que tá acontecendo já tá na metade do livro. E ai vem a Parte Dois. Vi muitas pessoas comentando o tanto que chorou porque é um livro triste, mas esse choro não chegava. O sentimento mais forte para mim nesse livro foi a raiva. Eu tenho uma opinião muito forte a respeito desse assunto e o fato da Lily aguentar tanta coisa e seus pensamentos me fizeram sentir uma raiva de me fazer tremer e querer chorar. Não chorar por estar triste, mas por esse sentimento ruim que habitava em mim. Eu quis parar de ler nesses momentos. Sabe quando você tá discutindo com alguém e você fica tão nervosa que tem que afastar ou você explode? Eu me senti assim. Entretanto, eu entendi muito bem a mensagem que você quis passar. Ninguém é igual. Ninguém sabe o que o outro está vivendo. As pessoas só sabem opinar quando estão de fora, mas quando tá ali, as coisas não são tão fáceis assim.Eu me senti muito próxima dos personagens. E mesmo em momentos que eu estava com muita raiva não consegui odiar de verdade quem eu normalmente odiaria. Foi difícil lidar com esse sentimento dúbio. É como você escreveu: ""Não existe essa coisa de pessoas más. Somos todos apenas pessoas que ás vezes fazem coisas ruins"" Esse livro é do tipo que acaba com você. E mesmo você sabendo disso, você quer mais. Mais histórias. Mais páginas. Já escrevi isso várias vezes e repito: você tem o dom de pegar histórias comuns e transformá-las em fenomenais. Desde o primeiro paragrafo fui fisgada. Amei a história, o final e principalmente a nota que você escreveu. Creio que meu choro de verdade saiu nessa parte. O que levo daqui? IT ENDS WITH US é uma história sobre a força da mulher.E, com certeza, sou uma das pessoas que irá recomendar muito seu livro. Acho que ele pode ser de ajuda pra mais pessoas do que a gente pensa. E espero que ajude. Enquanto isso continuaremos a nadar...Manda um beijo para sra. DeGeneres se algum dia você encontrá-la.Beijo, PB ----------------------* Pick a Book facebook /  instagram /  twitter pb.responde@gmail.com"
1960,5.0,"5 Stars is not enough.... Hours later after finishing this story I still feel tears about to start. A couple of times today I tried to tell some friends about the story, but couldn't get through too many words without tearing up. This was , without a doubt, one of the most amazingly beautiful heartbreaking books I've ever read. Now you may be thinking, if you've not read IEWU yet, "" Why would I want to put myself through something obviously so painful?"" You must, simply because there was such beauty in this pain. I don't think I've read a story before where I was so completely conflicted about how I wanted it to end; and at some point I just decided that I'd let CoHo lead me where she wanted and no matter the outcome I would accept it. And I did.. I do. But damn.... Going into IEWU I didn't know anything about what the THING would be. If you are a CoHo fan, you know there's always something you don't see coming. I was lulled into this amazing story about a beautiful and smart woman that grew up in a home that wasn't on the inside what I looked like on the outside and if not for love and friendship of boy, getting through it may not have been possible. Years later, she's made something of herself .. she's going for her dreams and not settling for anything less than the love she felt once a long time ago. Then she finds it in a man that make her feel giddy and wanted, and she's finally ready to give her heart to someone that will cherish it... even if he is reluctant to settle down. But love has a funny way of sneaking in. Gahhhh I was so wrapped up in watching this couple , that when the point in the story came that changed everything, I felt completely blind sided. Imagine your driving down the road, listening to your favorite song.. windows down, beautiful day, sunshine.... then all of a sudden a car slams into from the side and you spin and spin and spin until finally when the spinning stops you are shell shocked and can't believe what just happened. What follows is a journey unlike any other and through that journey, Lily became a character that I will never, ever forget. Although Lily was the one that my heart was wrapped around, the other characters as well dug deep into my heart. I cried for one and I hated that I cried for them at the same time I wanted to wrap my arms around them and hug tightly. It was one particular moment, when Colleen made me feel so completely conflicted, that I knew then that that was exactly what she wanted me to feel. I was feeling the exact same thing that Lily was feeling... and I know that was Colleens plan. To feel what Lily was feeling, to better understand.... This was brilliant.. and YOU MUST READ IT. Yes, it will rip you apart completely but by the end you will be put back together..... maybe not with the pieces fitting exactly right, but that's because you wont be the same afterwards. "
1961,5.0,"6 Stars!!This isn’t going to be a typical review for me. I do not want to recap the events or even describe the characters too much because I won't be able to do them justice. Please believe me when I say that it is better to go in completely blind. You will not be disappointed!I’m also going to be honest and tell you that I was left a blubbering mess by the time I finished this book. I was almost stunned speechless by the impact of this story and the depth of emotion it brought out of my heart and my memories. It Ends with Us is a devastatingly honest and brutally emotional story to read. It is also the very best book I have ever read by Colleen Hoover (maybe even ever, ever).I do not believe you can categorize It Ends with Us as a ‘typical’ romance novel due to the fact that so many people will have a visceral reaction to the story. I know for a fact that I did. My heart was in my throat for much of the book and I couldn’t stop thinking about it for days after I finished reading. This story has sharp barbs and they will grab ahold of your heart and leave a piece of themselves behind long after it ends.If you have ever read a book by Colleen Hoover, you know that she weaves multiple themes and layers into each of her stories. It Ends with Us is no different, but it feels so much deeper and more personal this time around. What may seem like coincidental or accidental truly isn’t and all of the subtle threads will start to come together to make you realize that the words on the pages are only a small part of the whole picture.I implore you to read this without seeking spoilers as this is a story that truly needs to be experienced firsthand. Even if you have never been personally affected by the subject matter contained within It Ends with Us, I believe every person who reads this book will be touched in some way or another. It will challenge your beliefs, it will give a voice to impossible situations, and it will remind you that it is ok to ask for help.I applaud Colleen for her honesty and her bravery to put this story out into the world. I believe that it will give empower and encourage everyone who reads it, for it is a story with both honest perfection and a powerful message.▸ This is a review of an ARC I won in a contest held by the author.▸ Order: Kindle | Paperback | Kobo | iBooks | Nook▸ For more reviews, visit

1962,3.0,"3-3.5 stars.This is a very difficult review for me to write. I've been thinking about it for a few days now and the inspiration that I had hoped for has not come. So in an effort to write down my thoughts before they are forgotten...here. we. go.I've never read a Colleen Hoover book before. I've seen so many rave reviews of Verity, that I knew I needed to read this soon and first. I'm glad I read it - and I liked it. I looked forward to reading it every time I picked it up and it did surprise me. The rating is higher than I originally thought because of the ending. I thought the ending was very well done. Where I struggled the most is my connection to the characters. Specifically, Lily's character and I'm not quite sure why either. I don't know if it's because she started the book with a hand on your hip kind of tone, with the reader learning about a defiant act that she had carried out and then as the story progresses (in a very perfect people and situations keep falling into her lap) she is someone completely different and by the time she is with the perfect guy you can kind of see what is coming so it kind of took away the shock??? (I realize that made no sense and I'm sorry.) Also, I don't know if it was because I have never been in a situation like this or have known of anyone who has been in a situation like this? (However, while that is me musing, I don't think that's it.) There have been plenty of situations I've read about that haven't happened to me or anyone I know and I have been more emotionally invested. When I really think about it, I had some issues with a lot of the characters. There were so many opportunities to give them more depth and to me it fell flat. Atlas? That relationship I wanted explored far more than it was. Let's get to what I really liked about the book. The end. (Said that.) The inner reflections and decision making of Lily's character. I thought she brought up some great points with regard to how society puts so much blame on women in domestic violence situations. (She admittedly did it herself about her mother.) The author's note was a really great touch and helped me understand even more about an issue I didn't know a lot about. (Also, I appreciate the author sharing how this issue touched her personally as it gave even more weight and believeability to the story she wrote.) All in all, I liked it. I don't think I'd recommend it like crazy to others, but if someone were to ask me if they should read it I would say yes."
1963,5.0,"Poderoso.Inspirador.Adorei.Ao 6º livro que li da autora finalmente vieram as 5 estrelas.--""Isto acaba aqui"" que sai hoje (15 de Maio) é um daqueles livros que mal terminamos de ler, não conseguimos parar de ler. Um daqueles livros que dias, semanas, meses e até mesmo anos após a sua leitura, iremos lembrar pequenos fragmentos ou simplesmente uma frase marcante.Como disse, já tinha lido todos os outros livros publicados cá em Portugal e tentei não ir com muitas expectativas para este, embora toda a gente dissesse que era o melhor livro dela até agora. Certamente que todos são fantásticos mas este atingiu-me em níveis que os outros não chegaram.Embora a idade das personagens deste livro - Lily e Ryle - não seja muito distante da faixa etária de outras personagens dos outros livros da Colleen, este livro é muito mais adulto e para mim já foge à categoria de New Adult.Não quero desvendar muito do livro porque acho que não sabendo quase nada do mesmo é a melhor forma do livro ter um grande impacto. Posso dizer que é um romance poderoso e inspirador. Gostei que só tivesse um ponto de vista, neste caso o da Lily, o que fez com que sentíssemos à flor da pele todas as emoções, dúvidas e receios da protagonista.  
Penso em todas as pessoas, que antes de mim, se viram nesta situação. Em todas as pessoas, que depois de mim, se verão nesta situação. Será que repetimos todas as mesmas palavras nas nossas cabeças nos dias a seguir a experimentar esse abuso às mãos daqueles que nos amam? Deste dia em diante, para o bem e para o mal, para a riqueza e para a pobreza, para a saúde e para a doença, até que a morte nos separe.Talvez estes votos não devessem ser levados tão à letra como algumas pessoas os levam.Para o bem , para o mal?Que.Se.Foda.Lily
(...)A nota da autora no final é muito forte mas foi o que me fez ter a certeza que estava perante o melhor livro da autora. É um livro pessoal e se é pessoal não há melhor pessoa para o escrever que a própria autora. É um livro que todos deviam ler, homens e mulheres, especialmente de uma faixa etária mais nova. Um livro que nos faz pensar muito na nossas acções e nas consequências ds mesmas, se realmente às vezes merecemos o que estamos a passar. É um livro que nos inspira em cuidarmos primeiro de nós e depois dos outros. Altamente recomendado!Opinião completa: http://algodaodoceparaocerebro.blogsp..."
1964,4.0,"This book is powerful. It is gripping and heartbreaking and so so so honest. I'm always hesitant to start a Colleen Hoover book because I know they're never just  a contemporary.  She always manages to create something deeper (and usually more emotional) than the reader anticipated. This book deals with a seriously important topic (and mature, so watch out!) and slowly guides the reader through each and every emotion the character feels. We follow Lily Bloom as she falls in love, suffers heartbreak, regrets her choices, and grows as a person. And from Colleen's writing, we don't just become sympathetic to Lily and her situation, no, we feel as if  we  are Lily. The complexity of the characters in this novel make every situation so much more real and only adds to the anguish. There is no right and wrong, no black and white in the book, everything has overlapped and become an array of colours. I felt that the note from the author at the end of this book was probably as heartbreaking (if not more) than the actual book. (view spoiler)[ Knowing that this story is derived from true events has my heart in shreds. I couldn't even begin to imagine how one would feel (or how to act) in such a distressing situation. My heart goes out to people everywhere, facing similar situations of abuse.  (hide spoiler)] “There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.” 4.5 stars!!"
1965,5.0,"If you’re looking for a book that will make you feel 100 different emotions, this is it. I knew what this was about going into it but I wasn’t expecting to feel such a wide range of emotions alongside Lily. This book shows that certain situations are never decisively right or wrong as human nature is so complex and while you might have an idea of what abuse may look like, there are actually a thousand variants and not a single one of them is okay. If you haven’t read this yet and do pick it up, please make sure you read CoHo’s note at the end. It makes this book that much more special."
1966,4.0,My first by this author and it made fascinating reading. It was so interesting to see how domestic violence can continue from generation to generation and how the victim can also become the enabler.The main character in this story was admirably strong and she managed to pull herself out of the relationship and regain a normal life. I was cheering her on the whole way through. I will certainly look out for more of Colleen Hoover's books.

1969,5.0,"
A powerful and evocative read. 
It has been a good 24 hours since I last read the book, and I still can't get it out of my head. It's pretty much plaguing my mind every chance it gets, pouncing its awful reality on my brain like a headache I could not easily get rid off. This book ended me. In the truest sense of the word. Colleen hoover bared her soul with this one. This is the Colleen Hoover I fell in love with. This is the Colleen hoover hitting it where it hurts the most. This is Colleen Hoover not just telling a story for entertainment but so much more. This is digging deeper. This is flaw and perfection. This book hits home.When you literally drop everything you're reading just to read this one book. That constant curiosity and want gnawing at you. That feeling when it is all you think about every goddamn hour waiting for a minute, just one fucking minute you could spend with it. Waiting for unadulterated time, and actually being thankful for traffic or for idle time because you can read a page or two. It is really hard to contain one's emotions when you just wanted to explode and tell every single soul you come across with how erratic your heart is beating, how there's this quesy feeling down the recesses of your being. The adrenaline rush., my heartbeat in 140/minute. Gahhh that was what happened to me, I was so attached to it, I practically couldn't function well. There are so many things going on inside my head, Im not even sure where do I get the energy to write this review because I feel like I am so emotionally exhausted. Boy I had to compose myself, I had to pace my room and contemplate about what I just read. It was as powerful as it was raw. It was as heartbreaking as it was real. Hats off to people who have read this and not one bit messed up, because I for one cannot deal with all the rush of emotions Im having all at once. I have so many things to say and I am afraid I may not be able to say everything there is to say. So let me just compose myself a little more. Give me 10 seconds more.You still there?Okay good.You ready to talk about it?To be completely honest, I'm not. First off, I heard few friends who didn't like it. Which I completely understand. There is no one book that is for everyone. I guess it is just a matter of how much of yourself can relate to the story. And to tell you, this book hits home. Like it really nailed it where the wound had been and let it bleed anew. Im not one to go into details how much I related to this book. But this book gives you that bigger perspective, that sense of maturity of having to make an intelligent choice. God I wish I could say so much without giving anything away. Since Im always the one to give spoiler free reviews, I will try my best to give the book justice by not delving too much about the details of the book. Let's talk about the characters. There is Lily, a character I was able to relate in more ways than one. I loved how Colleen Hoover made her character reach out to readers, they may not have experienced that same thing her character went through, but she portrayed every woman faced with a predicament but was able to make choices that are selfless and intelligent. Her character was the one that made the biggest impact, she was someone who may have made wrong decisions along the way just like most of us but had conviction to stand by what is right. She was resilient and courageous and I adored Colleen Hoover for sharing such an amazing character. Then there is Ryle Kincaid, a man who has everything but is deeper than what he let on. His character was not hard to love. in fact his character was the one you'll immediately fall for, until something happens (gahhh I can't tell). And then there is Atlas, that guy from the past, to me he was perfect, to me he was the guy I wished I met or have my own version of. It is pretty obvious that I am Team Atlas from the very beginning. And of course I can't fail to mention Alyssa and Marshall, god I love those two!! So funny! They seriously make the book a little lighter. Colleen Hoover made flawed characters, she made characters that are relatable. She made her characters into this real individuals with demons they have to deal with day in and day out, this was the magic of this book, how it was able to transcend from the pages of a book into the real world. How you can very well imagine that there is someone who is actually just like them in this world. The only issue I had maybe was how every character looked gorgeous and perfect, maybe we could change that?Now let's tackle the whole story. I never read the blurb, I went to this book as blind as one could get. I have literally no idea what it was about when I started reading it, and again I am reminded that there is beauty in that. Not knowing what it was about, not knowing what to expect, not knowing where the story will take you. And I am so glad I didn't read the blurb, I am so glad my judgment was not tainted by what others' thought about it. It was as pure as it could get. The story was a powerful one. It tackles heavy topics, something we should be talking about more, something we should not be afraid to read about, something we should challenge ourselves to understand more, something we should not shy away from. This book sent a message, loud and clear. Breaking the pattern, before the pattern breaks you. I had goosebumps whilst reading this book. Not only because I was able to relate to some extent but also because this was a 
bold and brave
 move by Colleen Hoover. Not many can write what they've been through, but Colleen Hoover made this book so significant and relevant you cannot miss the message she was trying to send across. It Ends With Us was different and mature. It was a sad book yet a satisfying one. It was as heartbreaking yet as surreal. It was real life magnified and detailed, it was real life painted in a different light. It was a book everyone should read, not just because it is loved by many but there is a very important message that you could learn from. This book is an emotional rollercoaster, something you thought you are ready for but as it progresses through its loops and big drops, you will realize why the hell did you even ride in the first place, but after all the scare and the heart-stopping moments you will learn how rewarding it is. That is exactly what I felt when I finished reading this book. Plethora of unwanted emotions came rushing in, and I could not contain it, it felt like my heart was going to burst, I literally had a hard time breathing, it touched sensitive topics that I would rather forget but I took the plunge, I was all in, and couldn't be more glad that I did. So Im gonna stop here, drop everything and read this. You can thank me later. And oh please read until Author's Note.Hands down to Colleen Hoover! Thank you for being BOLD and BRAVE!"
1970,5.0," I received an ARC of It Ends With Us from the publisher, but this in no way swayed my honest opinion about the book.*This review is semi-spoiler free—meaning I won’t give away major events but I will be mentioning many facts pertaining to well beyond chapter one. I feel as though I should start off by disclaiming that I’ve never read a book by Colleen Hoover. I’ve heard about her other novels, and how wonderfully painful they are, but contemporary just isn't my type of genre to read. Often I will try to pick up a contemporary novel, but most of those times I wind up just setting it back down. This time, however, I was captivate from the first page until the very last. I finished It Ends With Us in less than four hours. Honestly, I wasn’t paying attention to anything else around me but this plot and these characters and how terrifyingly relatable their story was.Lily recently graduated from college and moved to Boston where she began her own business. Her childhood was never easy, and she’d come to conclude that staying in Maine would never allow her to be free from those dark memories. One night while perched atop the roof of an apartment complex that isn't her own, she meets Ryle—a neurosurgeon with a darker past than her own. They bond, tell each other naked truths, and begin a slowly burning flirtation that inflames to a deadly obsession. However, Lily can’t seem to stay away from her old letters written about her missing friend, Atlas. Suddenly Lily begins to see a side of Ryle that she’d never noticed before, and it has nothing to do with the reappearance of Atlas…although he certainly doesn't make things any less complicated.  “As I sit here with one foot on either side of the ledge, looking down from twelve stories above the streets of Boston, I can’t help but think about suicide. Not my own. I like my life enough to want to see it through. I’m more focused on other people, and how they ultimately come to the decision to just end their own loves.”This book is about person growth and self respect, and it embodied those themes beautifully. A bit on the darker side in regards to the lethal relationships, It Ends With Us is so much more than I’d thought it to be.Hoover’s writing is something I wasn’t accustomed to, but that didn't hinder the experience in the slightest. She has such an easy flow to go along with, as well as a certain prolific voice. I finished this book in one sitting and I rarely ever read contemporary. The plot wasn't my usual cup of coffee (because there weren't any mythical creatures, inanimate objects that speak, realms that are hard to pronounce, bloody wars etc), but there was certainly a type eerie peculiarity that I picked up on right away. We aren't only reading about Lily, we are inside of her mind. When she’s happy, you’re happy. When she’s upset, you’re upset. When she’s in denial about the people most important to her, you’re…well, needless to say I might have thrown this book across the room a few times. Perhaps it was just my personal experience with foul relationships that made me bias, but I couldn’t love Ryle ever. Not even once. Not even when he was meant to be the tragic lover who was better off as a dream than a reality—because Hoover wrote him to be a synonym for the phrase “ugly truth.” Which is ironic, considering a big motif between Ryle and Lily was there occasional confessions which they called “naked truths.” For starters, when Lily first met Ryle he was kicking the hell out of a metal chair because his anger had gotten the better of him. Their relationship is in line with Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, just without the psychopathic behavior on our protagonists part. However, the physical and mental abuse is 100% present in both books. It’s all lilies (no really, there were actual lilies) and sunshine to cover up the scars and the naked truths that were more like screaming matches. All of the signs were there, right from the beginning. After their foreboding first meeting, he takes a photo of her without knowing her for more than an hour and blows it up to frame inside his house. Then he starts grabbing things from her, insisting upon things without asking, and the use of the word “shoving” to describe their sexual encounters sent many trigger warnings through my mind. Of course, this meant I wasn’t surprised when the physical abuse really became a definite thing that could no longer be overlooked by pretty dreams. Lily is a strong protagonists, even when she might not think so herself. After watching her father abuse her mother, and hearing the horror that came from Atlas’s own background, she was wary of men from the beginning. While she falls in love with Ryle, she does notice his abusive behavior almost immediately after their first time together. And while the readers might think that she should leave him at the first sign of bad intentions, Lily doesn’t do this for two reasons: 1. she is truly in love with Ryle and wants to help him control his anger because she understands that he is compassionate but his compassion can never make up for his mistakes. 2. she wanted to love her father as a daughter should, but she couldn't do so without wishing him dead. She doesn’t sympathize with her father, but she understands that he was a human and he made some very hideous mistakes. Her benevolent nature is essentially what keeps her and Ryle together for so long. This doesn't make her weak, it makes her bold and brave. She gives him chances, but when he messes up she lest him know he was wrong. In the end…well, I won’t say much because of spoilers but I will tell you that Lily makes the right choices.Not only were these characters so complexly written, but their names were also carefully thought up, and I appreciate that small objective immensely. Lily Blossom Bloom is an obvious metaphor for something small and fragile that will eventually go through change and morph into something bold and beautiful. Atlas, Lily’s childhood friend, although not being in the picture for nine years, was a steady part of Lily’s life. Whenever she needed someone to tell her the harsh reality of her situation, or someone to protect her when she couldn't see that she needed protection, Atlas was there. Atlas also happens to be the name of the Greek god who held up the universe upon his shoulders—and both men carried a great burden that often times wasn’t theres to withstand. The meaning behind this title also happens to be a quote in one of the very last pages of the book. Who the “Us” is will have you sobbing your heart out. I didn’t expect that coming, and it was such a bittersweet moment for me because it truly hit home. I don’t cry a lot when reading, but I definitely cried while reading this book.I’m certainly going to be reading more of Hoover’s books in the future. "
1971,4.0,"“I don’t know,” I say with a shrug. “As his daughter, I loved him. But as a human, I hated him.”It Ends With Us is narrated with poignant details of domestic abuse. The motives of this story is thought provoking and while we visualise the story descriptions are on point. This psychological thriller has a lot of fuss and brutal honesty. 'Covering up what she doesn’t want to see. Taking blame that isn’t even hers to take.'There are many things of Lily Bloom I thought right, I keep agreeing and relating most of the situation. Her father may be an adored mayor and her mother a loving teaching assistant but inside a home where happiness and sadness and safety was felt Lily grew up facing abuse not on herself but among the people who were supposed to love and make her feel safe. No one takes a second chance after life dealth them raw. Also same second chances are approached, we just need to take a chance. What happened to Lily, she could relate because she already went through it, when she faced it again she braved for herself and her future. She faces the same trauma with Ryle. It's apparent her internal conflicts regarding Ryle's neediness and his continuous apologies forces Lily to make hard dicisions. I thought Ryle was hard to hate and easy to sympathize because of his childhood trauma; while it's never justified Ryle is a ruined man. His future is a dash, is he safe enough for furthur relationships? Can he be recovered?A second chance for Lily after grief and heartache is great but I didn't like how Atlas was used. He was there when Lily needed him and is kept aside while she 'deals' with her problems. “In the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again fall in love with me.” He presses his lips against my forehead. “You’re still my favorite person, Lily. Always will be.”In the end I thought Ryle didn't deserve Lily and she doesn't deserve Atlas. Romance factor aside the violence and abuses are relatable to real life. "
1972,5.0," Edit : 2021.10.01 I do not know how many years it has been since I last read this and I have to only say that my feelings about this book did not change. As a matter of fact, it only got stronger. The older I've become the more this book hits me right in the core of my heart. Love is not always beautiful, it is not always smooth sailing. You can fall in love, but you can also have the courage to leave a love that is not healthy for you. I am still riling over the feelings this book gives. It is raw in the rawest feeling out there. Also a kind reminder, Atlas has to be one of the best characters Hoover has ever written about. He seems almost perfect and Lily, you deserve him and he deserves you. More importantly, Emmerson deserves a dad like him(which I wholeheartedly believe he would be). End of Edit Wow just wow. I have no other words. My hands are actually shaking as I write this review.As always I checked the reviews before hand and saw so many had given good reviews and written how emotional this book was and I thought maybe they were exaggerating cuz it's CoHo but boy was I wrong. This book is one of the best I've read this year and definitely stand behind Live Me by Celeste Grande (That takes the #1 spot for me still)This book has the ability to break people. Like literally. All those thing you see how people have written that you'll cry when reading and it'll practically tear you apart? Absolutely true. It tears you apart fraction by fraction and then by the end puts you back together. This isn't a love story. It's a story of woman who fights. If you are looking for a sweet story that leaves you with a message that's hidden inside layers of romance this isn't the book for you. I loved that fact. I loved how Atlas was there in the backdrop all the time but he wasn't the main focus of the story. The story heartbreaking and realistic. The thing is you can see stories like this in other books but the way CoHo has written it is beyond touching. Never in a million years would have anticipated what happens in the book. It was just shocking. But the ending was oddly satisfying. My eyes literally stinging with unshed tears for Lily. My hands feel numb and they are shaking at the same time right now. I don't have anyway else to express my feelings right now.This was a brilliant book and I would give it to anyone who loves reading. Heck I would give it to anybody. This is one of those books that have to be read by everyone. You need to live your life with Lily, Ryle and Atlas. You need to see this. You need to read every single word, from the story to the note from the author (I highly recommend you to read this) to the acknowledgements. Not a word in this book should be missed. Mrs. Hoover, this is by far your best work to date. I loved it and thank you so much gifting all of us with this absolutely beautiful work. I have no words beyond this."
1973,5.0,"I love Colleen Hoover. Everyone who knows me online and in real life knows that CoHo is my homegirl. So when I got an ARC of this book at ALA, I was almost on the verge of tears. I could not even believe that I had this book in my hands. Needless to say, the moment I landed from Orlando, I picked up this book and did not put it down until I was finished. Lily has worked hard for her life, moving from Maine to Boston and working towards opening her own business. When she meets a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle, Lily couldn't imagine her life being any better. Ryle is not a relationship guy and is determined to live his life a bachelor until the end, but something about Lily makes him change his rule. As the two enter a whirlwind relationship, Lily begins to question her choices, her life, and who she really is as a person. Wow. Just. Wow. I did not know what to think, feel, or even do when I finished this book. I follow Colleen Hoover all over social media, so I knew that this book was her most emotional and the one that she put most of herself into. I do not want to give anything away in this book (trust me, it's best to go in blind), but I can say that this was the most emotional book that I have ever read. EVER. I cried in this book and, if you know me, I rarely cry in books. The relationships in this book were so raw, so real, and so emotional. This really makes you think about what it means to really love someone and how much of yourself you give in a relationship. I really can't say anything else without giving anything more away. All I can say is that when you pick this book up, be prepared. Thinking about it, I do think that this is my favorite CoHo book to date. And seeing as I LOVE Maybe Someday, that's saying something. I loved Lily's character, her ambition, her drive, and her fierceness, but I also her vulnerability and her ability to let herself crumble and acknowledge that she really doesn't have everything figured out. It Ends With Us is a must read for EVERYONE and, when you do pick it up, park yourself on the couch with hours of uninterrupted reading time ahead of you and a box of tissues on hand. Trust me, you're going to need them. "
1974,5.0,"Made the mistake of starting this right at bedtime last night, needless to say I was up until the wee hours of the morning reading. So darn good!Full review to come with blog tour. Edited for review:I don't know when I will ever learn not to pick up a CoHo book right before bed. It never fails, they always suck me in and before I know it, it is four in the morning and I have had no sleep at all, but dang it if it isn't worth it.I should also learn to never declare a favorite because it happens ever time. I declare a favorite, a new release comes out and I have another new favorite all over again. All of CoHo's books are emotional. They always pack a punch and even though I knew to expect that going into this, I just wasn't prepared for how much of a punch it would really deliver. It was raw and emotional and even after you finish it when you think all the feels have been dealt out, you read her author's note and it floods them all in once again.I wanted to be upset and angry and the people I was suppose to be angry and upset with but the fact of the matter is this, I loved ever. Single. One. Of. Them. Good or bad, faults and all. It was so very hard not to just feel. It has been hours since I have put this book down and I am still thinking about it, still reeling from it, and still very much in love with it. There wasn't a single thing I didn't love about it, even the horrible heart wrenching make me teary eyed and ugly cry, parts. It was all just so beautifully portrayed and delivered. All so wonderfully searing and memorable. It is a story that will truly stay with me for a very long time and one that I will be re-reading in the future. *ARC copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*"
1975,5.0,"I have a lot of books rated as five stars. If Goodreads could go up to 100 stars, this book would still need more. When Colleen talked about this book before the release, she kept saying that this is the only book she's written that has made her cry. I've cried while reading every book of hers, so of course I was nervous but in a good way.I did not expect this at all. I'm not even going to say anything about the book itself because I want everyone to go into this blindly and experience it for what it is: one of the most important books you could ever read. If you've read a CoHo book you know there are always sensitive subjects, difficult topics, and sometimes painful moments. But this book blew all of that out of the water, in the best and worst ways. This is not only her saddest book but also her happiest book. I know that months from now, just thinking about this book will bring me to tears. Both happy and sad. This book is a must read. By everyone. It's not your typical new adult novel. This is a hard subjects to read about and knowing why she wrote it, it makes me want to give her a hug. She has so much strength just for writing this. So Colleen if you ever read this, please know that this book is personal for me too. Thank you for writing this. Thank you for giving Lily a voice and by doing that, giving me and so many people like me a voice. I don't know how to thank you enough."
1976,5.0,"“Sometimes the one who loves you is the one who hurts you the most.”I’m completely and utterly overwhelmed by this book. I’m seriously wondering if my first read of 2021 is going to be my best read of the year. It certainly is one of my favourite books of all time now. I’m still trying to process everything I read (and stop crying). Never in my life has a book made me cry this much. I was so emotionally invested in every single page. This novel is beautiful, devastating and inspiring in the best way. Just thinking about the characters and the story immediately makes me feel a whole wave of emotions and my heart starts racing. This book covered such brutally heavy topics and trigger warnings that left me broken and put back together all at once. The story is told by Lily Bloom, “that strange girl with the erratic red hair who once fell in love with a homeless guy and brought great shame upon her entire family”, as she faces unbelievable challenges in her life. I absolutely adored Lily and felt every single emotion with her on this journey. I cannot rate this book highly enough. This was my first ever Colleen Hoover book and I’m desperate to read more by her after this. She has so many books so I’m not sure where to start. If you have any Colleen Hoover recommendations, please let me know!"
1977,4.0,"Este libro debería leerlo todo el mundo.4,5. DÍGANME SI “BEST YEARS” DE 5SOS NO ES IDEAL PARA LA RELACIÓN ENTRE ATLAS Y LILY😭😭😭😭😭SI ALGUIEN LEYÓ ESTE LIBRO Y NO LEYÓ LA NOTA DEL AUTOR VAYAN A LEERLA YA.(GENTE LEI UN LIBRO EN INGLES, LO HICE, LO CONSEGUÍ)La historia me tocó en muchos sentidos, sobre todo porque es una realidad por la que he visto pasar a personas cercanas a mi. Sinceramente al tomar este libro no tenia ni idea de que trataba y creo que si lo hubiera sabido no lo hubiera leído, pero me alegro de haberlo hecho. No lloré, tal vez porque lo leí en inglés, pero todo lo que no lloré en el libro entero lo lloré en la nota de la autora. En algunos momentos me pareció lento pero tal vez puede ser porque lo leí en inglés y me demoré más de lo que me demoro leyendo uno libro en español. Por esta razón no llega a las 5 estrellas.MERECE MÁS RECONOCIMIENTO. ME PESA QUE NO ESTÉ TRADUCIDO AL ESPAÑOL, SI FUERA ASÍ SE LO RECOMENDARÍA A TODAS MIS AMIGAS."

1980,5.0,"

“I spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.”

This is one of the best books I’ve ever had the privilege to read. It is probably in the top five for best books I’ve ever read in my entire life. I have been looking for a book like this my entire life, and no combination of words I’m about to type, and you’re about to read, is going to do this masterpiece justice. But I will say that Gabby, Joce, and Elyse were all right, and I’m so happy I listened to them, because this book is worth every single ounce of hype. And when I say that this book is lifechanging, I truly mean it. This book is sold as a historical romance, where you learn about a fictional, famous, old Hollywood actress and all her marriages. What you get is a book that stars a bisexual, Cuban woman who was never allowed to talk about the love of her life; her wife. And when I say I cried during this book, I truly mean that I probably need to buy a new copy because I was the biggest mess you’ve ever seen. 

“And it will be the tragedy of my life that I cannot love you enough to make you mine. That you cannot be loved enough to be anyone’s.”

On top of this being a powerful book about race, sexuality, misogyny, and having to conform to societies norms, the true meaning I took from this book is that life is short, so damn short, and we shouldn’t spend it pretending to be something we aren’t. And we shouldn’t spend it doing anything less than loving the people who are worthy and deserving of our love. 

“I didn’t need boys in order to feel good. And that realization gave me great power.”

We follow Evelyn from the very start; losing her mother very young, her body developing very quickly, noticing others noticing her developing body, marrying a man so she can leave the dead-end city she grew up in, so she can become something more. Evelyn is unapologetic with her actions, and it is one of the most empowering things I’ve ever read. She plays so many more parts than the roles she is cast in. And Evelyn learns really quickly how to play each and every man she is forced to interact with, and she quickly learns what she can gain from each and every one of them, too. This story is told from two different timelines and two different points of view. One from Monique Grant, who is a biracial (white and African-American) woman who is going through a fresh divorce and trying to make something of herself in the journalism field. And her life changes the day her editor tells her how Evelyn Hugo is demanding her, and only her, to write something for her. 

“Heartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”

The other timeline(s) are all the different times in Evelyn’s life, and the different seven husbands that she had, while she is recounting the events that lead her to be telling Monique this story. Evelyn has lived a very full life, and is in her late seventies now, and is finally ready to talk about her life. But the entire book we are guessing why she has chosen only Monique for this job.

“Make them pay you what they would pay a white man.”

If you guys have been following my reviews, you’ll probably know that I talk about found family and how important it is to me a lot, but The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the epitome of how beautiful a found family can be. Evelyn and Harry’s friendship in this was one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever read in my entire reading life. 

“When you write the ending, Monique, make sure the reader understands that all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure it’s clear that I found it. Make sure they know that I am heartbroken without it.”

And the romance? The true romance in this book is the most romantic thing I have ever read in my entire life. And you guys know I’ve read a ton of romances, but they are all lesser to this. Every single one of them can’t compare with the romance in this book. I feel like every time I’ve used the word “perfect” to describe something that wasn’t the romance in this book, then I used the word wrong. 

“Please never forget that the sun rises and sets with your smile. At least to me it does. You’re the only thing on this planet worth worshipping.”

How many Evelyn and Celias are there in the world? How many are still playing the role that Evelyn was forced to play? I cry for every single person who must hide who they are, and who they want to love. And this book talks about many big things in queer history; from the Stonewall riots to the disgusting Reagan administration, but life still isn't anywhere close to equal in 2018. The prejudices, the discrimination, the virus/syndrome blaming, the looks I’ve experienced holding a girl’s hand while walking into a restaurant? Those are still in 2018, in the United States, but people act like none of those things exists because marriage is legalized, begrudgingly. I’m not writing this review to get on my soapbox, but I promise, we have a lot more work to do. And this book, this book lit a fire under me. I personally identify as pansexual, but I felt like the bisexual rep in this was a tier above anything my eyes have ever seen. Seeing Evelyn love all the parts of her, and all the different parts of her love, was something so awe-inspiring. I am still so overwhelmed with feelings, but if you identify as bi or pan, this is a love letter to you, I promise. 

“I was a lesbian when she loved me and a straight woman when she hated me.”

This book also focuses a huge importance on motherhood throughout the entirety of this book, and then I read the acknowledgement and started weeping all over again. Taylor Jenkins Reid was able to evoke the strongest emotions from me, and I just pray that things will be different for the generation of kids being raised right now. This was the first thing I’ve read by Taylor Jenkins Reid, but I will buy every single new thing she produces. The writing was so lyrical and addicting. I mean, I have a quote between almost every paragraph. This whole book deserves to be highlighted. The characters, well, my mind has now forever imagined that these are real people now, so there is that. The topics, themes, and discussions are beyond important. This book just makes me feel so passionately. This book is one of the most empowering pieces of literature I’ve ever consumed. And I am not the same person I was before this book. 

“I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.”

If you guys ever take a recommendation from me; please have it be The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Please, I’m actually begging you. I promise, this book is lifechanging, and I equally promise you that this book changed mine. There is magic between these four-hundred-pages. Pure magic. This story is addicting, enthralling, and so important. And if you’re an Evelyn, in 2018, I see you, but I hope it doesn’t take you as long as it took her to be happy. This will forever be one of the best books of my life, and I’ll cherish it forever.

1981,4.0,"I want to be as motivated and focused in university as Evelyn Hugo was in continuing to flourish after all of her 7 divorces and getting richer than all of her 7 husbands combined.... then spend the rest of her days frolicking in sun hazed fields of butterflies and dandelion clocks with her wife.This book was so wild I feel like it fundamentally changed me as a human being. I've witnessed cosmic justice at its coldest and its darkest. I'm genuinely so tempted to go buy myself an expensive bottle of wine and drink it alone in a hammock while listening to 80s music and cry just for the drama of it all. That probably won't solve all my life’s problems but it would certainly distract me from them.

so what is this book about?

Contrary to appearances, this is not the mere tale of a sultry glamourous woman with seven husbands and a tragic fame. This is the multifaceted story of a woman who's lived her whole life being two people, two images overlapping. A woman who was driven by the sheer compulsion for recognition combined with a need to charm people and shine and in that process, she’s built her own hell and heaven, solely crafted by the pure abstraction of her essence. A woman who’s got everyone to kneel before her throne unaware that it was born of lies so easily because everyone’s only ever liked the idea of her and not the reality of her.This is her story after the mask has worn off and showed what was lurking behind it, her truth without being edited, moderated and filtered down by the time it makes it to the screen, and then given to the public to make them feel very comfortable.This is her story 7 decades later after she’s decided it was never her job to make them feel comfortable in the first place. Evelyn Hugo no longer desires to be off on her own diva planet. She wanted to be on Earth. She wanted to be seen. She was past needing celebrity. She needed to be heard. She refuses to be trivialized for being a woman, a sex symbol, and a celebrity. She wasn’t just the Cuban girl who changed her name, dyed her hair, wore the emerald green silk dresses and the accompanying chains, smiled pretty, and shut up about everything else. She was ready to talk about the void, the unhappiness underneath the smile, her age, her divorces, and all the other unglamorous things that Hollywood likes to pretend never happens to its starlets.She is ready to declare that youth and beauty and the movies and the seven husbands were not her accomplishments. The family she’s had and lost and the woman she's so fiercely loved for almost six decades were.
They are just husbands. I am Evelyn Hugo. And anyway, I think once people know the truth, they will be much more interested in my wife.
What I loved most about this book was how passionate it was in bringing to light so many important topics.Starting with being a woman in an industry that beholds women to its whims, its likes and dislikes, promotes them as sexual objects and loves to build a woman up before tearing her down. An industry that estimates male celebrities based on intelligence or depth, while it values female celebrities based on how sexually available they are presented for male consumption. Especially when you're a woman of color. A woman of color could never escape from race or gender when she is making art. She can’t take off her color and sex and leave them at the door, and for that she's unfairly  redeemed unimportant and undeserving of a storyline and character development.This book was also single-handedly smashing the patriarchy. So buckle up.Evelyn Hugo’s story was a Call Out against the men who had cut her down way below size and built themselves up at her expense, who only used her as an attention machine to brag about their accomplishments and relieve themselves of mental durress, who only considered her a sponge that they can fill with their worries and ego and squeeze out when they please. The men who admired her confidence only when it made her fun, flirty, and comfortable in her sexuality. But the second she claimed space for herself, demonstrated high standards, a strong will, and the kind of assertiveness required to challenge them, then all of a sudden, she was a bunch of derogatory terms.And it's honestly so real how women are continuously expected to tone down and dilute their personalities in order for them to look more appealing to men. Women are always too opinionated, too educated, too confident, too strong willed, too passionate. Women are expected to chip away at their selves to become more soft and pliable and easy to stomach and all of it is just patriarchy's last attempt to uphold power and entitlement.This book also broached the topic of divorce and how it often means eternal shame for women. How only women are blamed when their marriages fail and ostracized when they seek to open their lives up to a quiet and peaceful independence. The media tore into Evelyn after each divorce, dragged her, burned her (metaphorically) alive, and buried her body underneath thousands of unsubstantiated celebrity gossip while her husbands remained unscathed.
People don’t find it very sympathetic or endearing, a woman who puts herself first.
Prior to reading this book, I didn't know it centered a queer woman of color and that it repped lgbtq+ themes which is why I didn't pick it up sooner. I really can't emphasize enough the importance of highlighting reprensentation in books. Readers from marginalized communities, including myself, long to see themselves in fiction, to learn that they can be the heroes of their stories and to finally get to star. Queer themes and issues had a prominent presence in this historical novel and it's really important that this be mentioned in reviews and blurbs!!
You imagine a world where the two of you can go out to dinner together on a Saturday night and no one thinks twice about it. It makes you want to cry, the simplicity of it, the smallness of it. You have worked so hard for a life so grand. And now all you want are the smallest freedoms. The daily peace of loving plainly.
This book is about Evelyn Hugo being honest about her negative habits and mistakes and taking ownership of her faults and flaws. This is her demanding to be humanized after being put on a pedestal her entire life. And most importantly, this book is a reminder that no matter how glamorous other people’s lives might look, they've had days, many days, and many days in a row where they've felt unloved and rejected and ugly and like nothing they do has a point, they’re not all that different and untouchable after all.Overall, I really loved this book. The plot twists were incredible. I really can't recommend it highly enough!!If you liked this review please consider leaving me a tip on

1982,5.0,"reread review: absolutely as good. this book had such a profound impact on me and still does.I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've decided that's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful. And there is something so woefully romantic to me about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others.So that's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.

“Make them pay you as much as they would a white man.”

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her. But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn. Awful, complicated, completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I’m not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She is such a good character.This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and I love that. Evelyn’s story is one of being a woman in a man’s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman’s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices were right. Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don’t… I don’t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but… well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn’s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always. 

“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”

And perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.
“You didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up, either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasons why we don't want to give. It shouldn't just be that we don't want to give up. And I don't... have any. “You have never felt like my other half.”
I know I’ve talked about a lot of specific things in the book, but I don’t know exactly how to put into words what this book meant to me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reid felt this book. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo left me an emotional mess, but also a happy mess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book, and I want you to be as well.Blog | Goodreads | Twitter | Youtube"

The Written Review
3.75 stars



Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.
Evelyn Hugo was the star of the century. She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Every man wanted her and every woman wanted to be her.Perhaps most famously, Evelyn Hugo was married seven times. Each divorce only increased her fame. Rumors swept through the tabloids like wildfire.
I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.
And now, age 79, Evelyn Hugo decided to auction off her most wildly famous gowns and offered one lucky journalist (Monique) an interview that will last a lifetime.However, Monique soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the most 
scandalous and salacious 
thing that has ever graced this world.Monique would be a fool - an absolute fool - to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind. 
Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.

Overall, this one was good but I was never wowed. 
Everyone and their mother was talking up this book and while I agree that it is engaging and scandalous (in a good way)...I don't know. I just expected more from it.I definitely think it was well-written...just a bit dull in areas. We start the book with 40 pages of just talking up Evelyn Hugo and it really did drag. There's only so many times I can hear about how 
wonderful and stunning
 a person is before it gets boring.I think if more of the marriages were teased in the beginning - just to give the audience a taste of the mystery surrounding her love life (rather than going on and on about how intriguing it was...without telling us what was intriguing about it) would have helped significantly.Once we got to her life, the book certainly picked up. I really loved how Evelyn's sexuality was portrayed in this book. I liked watching her grow as a person - from a teenager using sex to get herself out of a hellhole to falling in love and finding it something to be cherished.Her love for (view spoiler)[ Celia (hide spoiler)] throughout the years truly made this wildly unbelievable story cinch for me. Honestly, (view spoiler)[ her relationship with Celia  (hide spoiler)]Their love was expertly done, with all of the fear and paranoia associated with the times, that it truly felt like real life. Ultimately, this was an enjoyable read, a bit slow paced, but enjoyable nonetheless!
Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.

Is Evelyn Hugo going to tell me just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat but never enough to truly reveal anything?
I can't say for sure what drew me to this book. It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, and I haven't read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters, I figured, because I probably wouldn't like it anyway. And I was HOOKED.It's perfect, easy beach read material. It's not particularly deep, it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new, and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo's story was so delicious and compelling that it stood out, and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands, and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?The framing of the story reminded me a lot of The Thirteenth Tale. Like that book, in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. Unlike The Thirteenth Tale, this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye, but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout, we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?The more I got to know Evelyn, the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career, but she knows it and she also knows she'd probably do it all again. She's played the Hollywood game, dated famous men to further her career, and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry's sexism and, in some ways, capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame, more roles, more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that didn't like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied. Despite everything - and because of it - I liked her.I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique, through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness, right until the ending's final reveals. I enjoyed every moment.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"
1985,2.0,"this didn't work for me, but i get how it could work for othersthere's something so glamorous and sad about the golden age of film. throw in a cuban bisexual main character who has to hide her identities and it's a sure fire way to get people intrigued. and i was, throughout the entirety of the book. this book did not lack in keeping my interest.but there were too many things i had issue with. and if i hadn't read all but one of TJR's previous works i might have been able to overlook it. but once i notice a pattern it tends to color my judgment of an author's work. 2 big things for me: writing & relationshipsfirst, i knew going into this that TJR's writing does not work for me. it's not hard to digest which is nice. but the writing is so clear and no frills that it's odd when we get these little nuggets of prescriptive morality. she doesn't want the reader to form their own opinions, she's rather just hold your hand to the ""point."" which happens in almost all of her books. makes for a super quotable book, but for me it felt forced at times.and then the relationships. that was 99% of my issue with this book. it wasn't that Evelyn was a wholly unlikable character, it was her relationship with Celia that grated on my last nerve. again, this is something that is a recurring theme in TJR's book and honestly i hope to god this is not something she has intimate knowledge of. but it seems like the only way she can write relationship problems is by making the love interest awful. they have to have blow out fights, say things they could never take back/should have never been said, leave each other etc.and i'm not saying that this doesn't happen in real life. but after the first time this kind of thing happens, i could like to see the characters grow and learn how to cope like adults. because i'm only 24 and even i don't pull those kinds of stunts with my boyfriend. cause i'm not 16 anymore. and this issue was particularly egregious to me because yes sure the time period was hostile to F/F relationships. but when you have a veritable shit load of money you can cover things up. that wasn't the issue. these two were just too pigheaded to make things work. so. so. irritating.lastlythere is a plot twist that occurs that the end of the book that i really did not appreciate. the twist itself was not bad but given the main character's identity in relation to a deceased person's identity i was honestly appalled. you would think a POC understands POC struggles and wouldn't frame a fellow POC but what do i know.it was just a detail that really rubbed me the wrong way.all that being saidit was really refreshing to see exploration into a time period, culture, and sexuality that is not often explored. i know some people really identify with these characters and i'm glad this book exists. it just did not work for me."
1986,5.0,"This is genuinely one of the most remarkable novels I have ever read. It is a favorite of the year, it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted by The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and I will never forget how much I adore this book. CW: domestic abuse, death/grief, homophobia/biphobia, racism (view spoiler)[abortion & suicide (hide spoiler)] Adult fiction is not typically my cup of tea, especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being, but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful, vivid, and descriptive. There isn’t a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging – it was a huge struggle to put the book down. Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating, especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will, her independence, her strength, her cunning, and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.Personally, I didn’t LOVE Monique, though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of it’s strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story, but it’s for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn, I just did not care for Monique’s individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life, but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn. Edit 4/3/2019 - After a second read, I GREATLY appreciate Monique. Her character is so nuanced and necessary to the story. I totally relinquish much of my initial feelings on her.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME. I will never forget how in love I am with this story and all the ways it has affected me. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone who is interested in spectacular fiction novels (which should be all of you.)"
1987,5.0,"A spectacular book well deserving of 5 stars. All of the characters feel like real people: complex, nuanced, and painfully human. Not only is the story incredibly diverse despite its Old Hollywood setting, it also has the best bi representation I've ever seen. The journey through Evelyn Hugo's life is filled with trials and tribulations, love and loss, mistakes and redemption; all the while, Reid does a great job at making you feel all the emotions along the way. I left this book feeling reflective, melancholic, and touched by how many things can happen in life that are both awful and wonderful. Overall, a compelling read that is beautifully put together as it is emotionally satisfying."
1988,5.0,"(4.5) I’ve been struggling with a lot of books lately because I just don’t care about them. I don’t care about the story. I don’t care about the characters. I just don’t care! I thought it was all me, that I must have a cold heart but then this book happened.I thought this was a literary fiction but it read more like a chick lit. A deep chick lit if that can even be a thing. This book made me realize that it is absolutely not me but them! I cared deeply for the flawed characters in this book. When reading a book heartless Emily does not cry. Ever. Well, I did while reading this one.Just pick it up and read it already!"

1990,5.0,I—HOW DO I COPE????
1991,5.0,I envy the people who'll be reading this for the first time.
1992,5.0,What an extraordinary and surprising read. Absolutely adored this one. 
1993,5.0,"not to be dramatic, but if there ever comes a point in time where the fate of the human civilisation is coming to an end and we need to create a time capsule to immortalise our posterity, this book better be in it. there has never been a more honest and enthralling book in the history of the world, ever. i really dont even know where to begin. its books like this which confirm my belief that fiction will always be better than nonfiction, because it would be impossible to find a biography that could paint the story of a womans life half as well as this did. this was extraordinary, in every sense of the word. just the depth of this book was spectacular. not to mention the diversity and representation and writing quality and complex characters. everything was just outstanding. im kind of in that shocked state right now (if you didnt already notice) where im still reeling from what i just read. a more concise and coherent review will come once i calm down from being so hyped about the brilliance of this book and can process everything. ↠ 5 stars"
1994,5.0,"”Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.”This book was so, so, so GOOD!! I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I’d love it with all my heart! <3 There’s just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told! We didn’t only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean “Hollywood Digest”, “Sub Rosa” or the “New York Tribune”, they all wrote about Evelyn’s life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich. I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn’s character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn’t come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It’s a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out. Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn’t manage to sort out my feelings and I still don’t know what to do with them. Maybe I’ll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there’s no such thing as making peace with an ending like that. And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid’s plan all along. ;-)The characters:
Welcome to my characters section, aka “The spoilery spoiler zone”! If you didn’t read the book yet and still want to be surprised by its revelations you better don’t continue to read my review. I’m worse than any tabloid mentioned in this book and I’ll spoil you relentlessly! If you still want to read my gossip, go ahead, but don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-P
Evelyn Hugo:”And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.” Oh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can’t even! <333 It’s so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh, WHAT. A. WOMAN!  I think I might be in love with her! <333”Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.””I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.” ”I regret every second I didn’t spend with her. I regret every stupid thing I did that caused her an ounce of pain. I should have chased her down the street the day she left me. I should have begged her to stay. I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, ‘I’m in love with Celia St. James!’ and let them crucify me for it.”Celia St. James:”I really like you. I like watching you on-screen. I like how the moment you show up in a scene, I can’t look at anything else. I like the way your skin is too dark for your blond hair, the way the two shouldn’t go together and yet seem so natural on you. And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.”Now here’s the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn’s life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but – and here comes the huge 
BUT
 – I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don’t know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn’t like that Celia wasn’t only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You’d think a person who represents the “L” in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn’s life and that made me really sad. =(”That was how it was with Celia. When you denied her what she wanted, when you hurt her, she made sure you hurt, too.””So I told myself that the spark between Celia and me was just a quirk we had. Which was convincing as long as it remained quirky. Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”Harry Cameron:”I want to be with someone I love. I want to have a companion. I’d like to bring someone home to my family. I don’t want to live alone anymore. And I want a son or a daughter. We could have that together. I can’t give you everything. I know that. But I want to raise a family, and I’d love to raise one with you.”Aside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron was truly the best thing about this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he’s an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry’s grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_TMonique Grant:”Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn’t like it to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?” To say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique’s character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn’t dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father’s death was necessary to find her happiness and I’m convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*”I’m Evelyn.” She reaches out and takes my hand, shaking it. It strikes me as a unique form of power to say your own name when you know that everyone in the room, everyone in the world, already knows it.””I insist that you be ruthless in your negotiating, Monique. Make them pay you what they would pay a white man. And then, once you’ve done that, every penny from it will be yours.”The relationships & ships:Evelyn & Celia:”I wanted to give her a lot of things. I wanted what I had to be hers. I wondered if this was what it felt like to love someone.” Those two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn’t let them and wouldn’t have understood, because they didn’t want the same thing, because they weren’t ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because… just 
BECAUSE!
 There was always another reason why they couldn’t be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn’s outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn’s sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic… more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T”Evelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.”Evelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, “Celia St. James.”The room is quiet as Evelyn lets herself hear her own words. And then she smiles, a bright, wide, deeply sincere smile. She starts laughing to herself and then refocuses on me. “I feel like I spent my entire life loving her.””It’s not wrong,” Celia said. “It shouldn’t be wrong, to love you. How can it be wrong?”“It’s not wrong, sweetheart. It’s not,” I said. “They’re wrong.””If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything,” she said. “And we have always loved each other so much, more than I ever thought I could be loved, more than I ever thought I could love. So why … why couldn’t we overcome it?”“We did,” I said, turning towards her. “We’re here.”She shook her head. “But the years,” she said.”There’s a difference between sexuality and sex. I used sex to get what I wanted. Sex is just an act. Sexuality is a sincere expression of desire and pleasure. That I always kept for Celia.”Evelyn & Harry:”You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”So I fell down.And Harry caught me.Their friendship was everything, absolutely 
E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.!!!
 Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can’t even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other’s mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It’s so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that… ARGH! I just LOVED them!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I’m incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs* ”I promise I’ll do whatever I can. I promise you we will figure this out.”“OK,” Harry said, and then he squeezed my hand back and walked out the door. “We will figure this out.” ”I want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.” I grabbed his hand tighter. “But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it’s time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.” The bi rep:”It really makes you think, doesn’t it? That people were so eager to believe we were swapping spouses but would have been scandalized to know we were monogamous and queer?”And now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I’ll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn’t even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I’m inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn’t accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333”Being bisexual didn’t make me disloyal,” Evelyn says. “One has nothing to do with the other. Nor did it mean that Celia could only fulfil half my needs.” ”I hated being called a lesbian. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with loving a woman, mind you. No, I’d come to terms with that a long time ago. But Celia only saw things in black and white. She liked women and only women. And I liked her. And so she often denied the rest of me.””Wow,” he said. “Incredible. I married a dyke.”“Stop saying that,” I said.“Evelyn, if you have sex with women, you are a lesbian. Don’t be a self-hating lesbian. That’s not… that’s not becoming.” My conclusion:The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I’m convinced everyone who reads “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” will learn something good from it! I’m usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don’t hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charming Ashley for this wonderful buddy read! We both didn’t have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I’m glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we’ll find another book to buddy read again! =)"
1995,5.0,"5/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.” This book is phenomenal. This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It's a pure 5 star for me. I'm irrevocably astonished and astounded. I want to hug and kiss this book till I bleed. I couldn't leave it down. I just couldn't. Storytime. It's 12:36am, I have to wake up in 7 hours or so and I'm casually reading this book. I'm on page 233, 50 pages after it got amazingly good for me. And then this line makes its fucking appearance. ""I have no idea that in less than a week, Evelyn Hugo will finish her story, and I'll find out what this has all been about, and I will hate her so much that I'll be truly afraid I might kill her."" LIKE??? AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK. And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn't survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let's talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, the 
Outlander
 and 
Ross Poldark
 kind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me. I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn't quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I'm into the book 100%, ready to know EVERYTHING about EVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren't any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn't have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn't a character to me. She is a person. With influences from Merilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn't actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can't help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn't ashamed about it. She doesn't give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one. Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn't care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn't let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn't achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn's story started, we didn't get much of her. But I'm so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I'm really proud of her. THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can't entail good representation. IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it's a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn't have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn's life is so engaging and complicated, you can't get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It's more about talent, at the most part. I'd like to hope so. In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I'm gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation. WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I'm scared they would ruin it. I'm always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn't recommend this enough. It doesn't matter if you don't read historical fiction or adult, PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won't regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!"

1997,5.0,Such a fabulous well crafted story! I'll be talking about it more in my stories I ate this month video going up tomorrow =) (Oct 9)
1998,5.0,"FULL REVIEW POSTED*5+ Stars* Brilliant! If I could recommend only one book for 2018, THIS would be it!THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO not only surpassed my already-lofty expectations, but knocked my proverbial socks off as it shot straight into the open arms of my favorites-shelf. The spirit of this story mirrors its leading lady, Evelyn Hugo, in that it feels gigantic and larger~than~life. I wanted to devour this whole, yet savor it in tiny pieces so I could linger with these characters whom I grew to admire for their extraordinary strengths and unabashed weaknesses. The exceptionally beautiful, world-renowned Evelyn Hugo spent most of her life doing whatever it took to not only become Hollywood’s most iconic female movie star, but to remain planted in the fickle grip of fame and fortune. Evelyn’s now up there in years and wants to tell her story. Not the story the public knows—her real story—the one that’s flooded with glamor, betrayal, secrets and deceit, and one hell of a complicated love story so intensely authentic it dares to bare it all, even the ugly. And I was so desperately in love with this love story.This tale is delivered through the heart and eyes of a woman who's desperate to be seen beyond her celebrity, and it takes an unflinching look at what it means to “make it”: The pride that follows success, and the trail of guilt that lingers for all those who were trampled and used on the way to the top. But beneath the guise of fame, Evelyn's story transcends, and its pieces resonate with all of us, as we can all see a bit of ourselves in her struggles and triumphs; love and loss; pains and pleasures. Evelyn Hugo isn’t just a brilliant fictional character, she is a bold representation of life’s extravagant journey being stripped down to its most basic components—i.e., the only things that actually matter in life. The mystery entwined in this one is taut and sophisticated as it carries the plot full circle, opening our eyes to all that is harsh and all that is sacred. I laughed, I cried, I enjoyed—and my heart was overflowing with love for all of it. Taylor Jenkins Reid masters the art of storytelling and epitomizes the value of honesty, the significance of life, and the beauty in love of all forms. Her writing is polished and engrossing, sophisticated and sharp, witty, fluid, and I can go on…but most importantly, it has a voice that carries its messages straight into the heart of the reader. This story stole my breath from its first pages right up until its final line, which was perhaps my favorite line of the novel. To say I couldn't put this down would be an unjust understatement, because I don’t think I’ll ever truly be able to put this one down.

1999,1.0,"Worst Read of Decade, 2011-2020Glucose GluttonyTo paraphrase a quote attributed to Abe Lincoln: ""For those who like this kind of a book, it is just about the kind of a book they would like.""I repeatedly winced and rolled my eyes at such soppy, silly prose as implausible as:
“I loved you so much, that I thought you were the meaning of my life... I thought that people were put on Earth to find other people, and I was put on Earth to find you. To find you, and touch your skin, and smell your breath, and hear all your thoughts....”
😵‍💫 Seven Husbands, a trove of truisms, brims with bromides:  Some marriages aren’t really that great. Some loves aren’t all-encompassing. Sometimes you separate because you weren’t that good together to begin with. [hmmm, ... you don't say...]Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. 🥺When you’re given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. It felt like water in the desert. 🙄If I want things to change, I have to change how I do things. And schmaltzy advice: “You have to find a job that makes your heart feel big instead of one that makes it feel small.” If you're still on the fence after reading this review, by all means, read the book!"
2000,5.0,"Wow. I did not expect to love this book as much as I did. Absolutely LOVED it. This is a story of a powerful love between two women in a time when it was unacceptable. The author has a huge command of language and seamlessly shifts from first person present tense to first person past tense and even to second person. Amazing. I marveled at the writing craft, the storytelling. The language and the passion to communicate the love is mesmerizing. The main character Evelyn Hugo is a swirling whirlwind that pulls everyone that comes near into her vortex. Even though Evelyn Hugo does some truly heinous things, the justification and motivation is clear and we pull full her. The atmosphere, setting and flavor of old Hollywood is captured in just enough detail. The underlying plotline, the mystery that was carried along and always there lurking really paid off in the end. In all the thousands of books I have read in my life time I have found very few that have been able to pay-off with the last line of the book. This author does it with stunning panache and verve. Loved it. For me this book is a true “tear-jerk-er,” as my mother used to call them. (She was married five times, so I might’ve had a little insider experience with Evelyn Hugo. Mom, married three Jim’s, a Bill and a Bob. The third, and last was a Jim and my sisters nicknamed him Jim de jour. Sorry I digress).This one is going up in my top five of the year.Highly recommend this book.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson series."
2001,5.0,so unfortunate that i will pass away before i find a book that i love even half as much as this one
2002,5.0,"I read Daisy Jones and the Six a couple of months ago. Usually I don’t read two books by the same author this close – mainly so I can spread out my enjoyment of their works. But, to be honest, when I put them both on hold, I didn’t realize they were the same author! Then, the holds come in when they come in . . . so, I have to read them whether I am ready or not. In this case I am definitely overwhelmed with Taylor Jenkins Reid goodness! Spoiled, even!Both of these books have an interview/tell all format. I have to say that I find it to be one of the best formats I have come across recently. Reid turns fiction into non-fiction; making it feel like I am standing in line at the supermarket looking at the most recent shocking celebrity news on the cover of Us or seeing the most recent clickbait links on me feed. I am addicted from the very beginning and I cannot wait for the next scandalous event to occur. And, she really does such a good job making it feel so real – I want to rush off and start Googling these people and then I remember they don’t really exist!This book deals with some very sensitive topics: gender roles (women being treated differently than men), the historical stigma of homosexuality, sexuality in general (i.e. how it used to be shocking for women to be depicted enjoying sex or be blatantly sexual), racism, death/suicide, etc. I know that some of these topics can trigger people, but I think Reid does a great job of interweaving them into the story and showing how each affects the characters. None of it is unnecessary, overdone, or purely for shock value. Basically, Reid is just a fantastic storyteller. She pulls me in and doesn’t let go. I don’t want to put her books down and, when I do, I cannot wait to get back to them. I hope if you try her out, you have the same experiences I did."
2003,5.0,"I'm going to think until I do my wrap up if this will be a 4.5 stars read or 5 star read. BUT WOW. Just know that I loved it.No puede ser que no hubiera escuchado sobre este libro antes, ¡es una maravilla! Y las miles de reseñas positivas lo respaldan. La historia de Evelyn Hugo te quita el aliento. Es intrigante y muy cautivadora; y es de esas de las que simplemente quieres saber MÁS Y MÁS. Yo no podía creer lo inmersa que estaba en la lectura. Solo quería saber más sobre Evelyn Hugo, sus logros, sus triunfos, sus tropiezos, sus motivaciones y, obviamente, sus siete esposos.¿Cómo fue que se casó siete veces? Y aún más importante... ¿quién fue realmente su gran amor?No creo que sea un libro con mucha profundidad, pero sí muy adictivo, hace tiempo que no me la pasaba TAN BIEN y tan picada leyendo una historia. Es que WOW, me sentía dentro del libro, como si Evelyn Hugo fuera un ícono del mundo real y yo fuera su fan y quisiera conocer cada uno de sus secretos. Me encantó, de verdad."
2004,3.0,"At least I know why Evelyn recruited Monique, the worst journalist of the year, to write her biography. I thought asking astute questions was a part of interviewing a famous person. Apparently not.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a quintessential beach read. The prose is very readable, the plot soapy. You borrow the juiciest, gossipiest parts of Elizabeth Taylor's orMarilyn Monroe's love lives - you get a cracktastick pulp read. It reminded me of the family sagas of the yore, kind of like The Thorn Birds. Only this book needed another 300 pages to dig deeper into the dramas of Evelyn's life and her psyche. I was entertained by the events of Hugo's Hollywood adventures, but ultimately this book lacks depth. Nobody else noticed how superficial everything is in this novel - relationships, emotions, portrayals of race and queerness? The novel is framed as a biography written by a talented up-and-coming jornalist, but reads as if thrown together by an employee of a gossip rag, who included all of the salacious parts of a famous person's life, but none of that person's interiority. Totally see why it's a bestseller. It entertains but never challenges."
2005,5.0,"I... don't even know where to start.This was absolutely FANASTIC, and I was expecting to love it (this is a 5-star predicted read) but I was completely blown away. The characters are utterly captivating and complex. The audiobook was wonderfully narrated. I am a FAN! "
2006,5.0,Fanfreakingtastic!! The audio was awesome too! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
2007,5.0,"Update: $2.99 Kindle special today. This book is TERRIFIC. Men- women - most readers will love it. Great price if you’ve missed it! Evelyn Hugo, born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban immigrants, grew up poor in Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City. By 1955 she was in Hollywood. Evelyn is beautiful....as tall and slim as a ballerina, with straight thick eyebrows, oversize almond shape eyes, blonde hair, ( dyed only after she arrives in Hollywood to help her get acting roles), rich, powerful, charming, and exudes a casualness and confidence that makes her all the more radiating. This enchanting lovely woman was humble - down to earth in areas that mattered. Yes, she had seven husbands, too! I was quickly bewitched, fully captivated by Evelyn Hugo. It was her calm wisdom - humble but direct speaking that moved me. She made a distinction about words and how they can be misleading, that made me want to SCREAM OUT AND SAY THANK YOU FOR THAT!!!!!! There was a scene early in the book where it was very clear how one word could induce shame. Words really can hurt and paint evil pictures.... preaching...assumptions before asking.... sarcasm.....etc. I sat and thought about all the times people have used words - not chosen them carefully - and as a result I'd feel hurt or belittled. I'm no better. I also thought about times I did the same to others. Words do hurt and damage the spirit- and the trust of relationships. Ms. Hugo, 79 year old Hollywood legend, handled those 'wrong words' with grace, correcting - teaching- inspiring her new-friend at the time while having compassion for 'herself'. Her purpose was not to hurt her friend who spoke the wrong words - but also not to allow for the misleading word to be, ""misleading"". I started reading 'slower' ( wanting to take in every word out of Evelyn Hugo's mouth), when I realized this Hollywood notable Starlett was sincerely deserving- and worthy of the fans she has -- a celebrity to love!!! I soon discovered this classy gorgeous woman had acute self-awareness, high levels of emotional intelligence, clearly socially aware, and relentlessly lived a full life of many experiences filled with joy and challenges. I felt like I was given a gift - absorbing wisdom from this 79 year old woman. Her life experiences were fascinating, glamorous, scandalous and she herself was .....*extraordinary*. I was learning from this fictional character. Monique Grant, Evelyn's new friend, 35 years old, is an unknown reporter at 'Vivant', in Los Angeles. Evelyn wants Monique to write a book about her life story. Everyone in the journalism community- including Monique's boss, Frankie, were shocked that Evelyn asked for Monique. ONLY Monique -- or no deal at all!!! There are some complications for Monique to figure out with work--plus her husband, David just left her....( not even married a full year), but her life is about to change. Why did Evelyn pick Monique to write her book? We wonder right away!!!We also want to know about Evelyn's life - her husband's - and which one she loved the most. We have many questions as we take this journey-- and it's delicious- with many insightful life lessons and messages.Intimacy - closeness - trust - and real friendship grows as Monique listens to Evelyn's life story. Monique is past the point of remaining objective. She knows how specular of a human being Evelyn is. Against all of her journalistic integrity Monique feels a full range of emotions for her. Monique begins to feel a deep connection and love with Evelyn. There are many juicy stories that get revealed about Evelyn's past marriages, relationships, and movies she stars in, ""Father and Daughter"", ""Little Women"", and the title role in ""Anna Karenina"", however when Evelyn begins to share about her present day life......a secret door becomes unhinged. Both women will have to face the truth together. My final words.... THIS NOVEL IS EARTH SHATTERING FABULOUS- FANTASTIC -WONDERFUL -soooooo GOOD I can barely stand it!!!!!! It's 'not' what you think it is!!!!!!I laughed, I cried, and thankful that this book kept me cozy company while sick in bed!!!!!Many Thanks Atria Books, Netgalley, Jamie, ( my friend who demanded I 'not' wait for the audiobook book as planned - that I RUN over to Netgalley and begged for this book and then drop everything and start reading if given the opportunity -- bless you Jamie Girl.... and last to Taylor Jenkins Reid... ( you really out-did yourself with this novel... amazing!!!! Love You for it!!)"

Note: If you haven't read the book and don't wanna spoil yourself, please don't read any further. My review is full, or partially, of major and minor spoilers. And it seems like I can not restrain myself of that, lmao.With many playlists on Spotify (wordkey: evelyn hugo), I read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo not knowing (very naive of my part tbh) that my heart was gonna be torn apart like a piece of paper. Huh, who would said it? And even the playlists are masterpieces, and have many Taylor's songs, which iS SO GODDAMN PERFECT.I must warn y'all that I'm still crying.This book is perfect. The writing, the pacing, the characters, the romance, the trageDY, MY FUCKING HEART IS BROKEN, TJR, PLEASE, WHY DID YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO MY SENSITIVE HEART?Anyhow.We have the famous actress and gorgeous woman, Evelyn Hugo, who is known for her many movies back at the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's, and for the scandals of her seven marriages. Evelyn Hugo is announcing that she will auction 12 of her most memorable gowns through Christie’s to raise money for breast cancer research, of which her daughter, Connor, died.Monique Grant is a reporter for the magazine, Vivant, and is specifically by Evelyn Hugo to write her autobiography, but, why Monique? What does she have for someone like the legend Evelyn Hugo wants her to write a book about her life? That's the interesting part.So, Monique goes to Evelyn's aparment and listens her story. From how Evelyn lost her mother and how she swored she would get out of Hell's Kitchen, away from her father and poverty, and because her mother dreamt with became someone famous and live in Hollywood one day. She was born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban parents, but had to change her name by Evelyn Hugo.She talks about how she made her way to L.A, how much she sacrificed and her husbands, of course.My 3 favorite husbands are: Rex North (he was one of my 3 favorite marriages) to get more money for the movie their starring: Anna Karenina (the gods know how I much love Anna Karenina, so I'd have given my kidney or soul to see that movie). They both agreed to this plan and they're happy this way... Until Rex's pair, Joy, is pregnant and they want to get married. Celia is also married with John Braverman.Harry. hE IS MY PRETTY BABY, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH. DKFJDJFGHJFG. I really loved Harry, he and Evelyn are best friends, wich makes their relationship normal and not forced. Evelyn and Celia get back together, and Harry and John are dating, which is cuTE, DON'T TOUCH MY KIDS. Evelyn and Harry have a kid: Connor. And then, everything goes downhill when Evelyn films a movie with her abusive ex-husband, Don Adler, and make a sex scene.Celia is sick and knows she's gonna die, so they form this plan to move to Spain, Evelyn has to marry Celia's brother, Robert (he's the third), so Celia's things belong to her when she dies. They do it, but then, Harry dies in a car accident, where was another man with him. Evelyn is devastated by the loss of her best friend and let me tell you that I cried so much with this.When Celia died, a big part of me died with her. It was heartbreaking.
""I had lost her. My love. My Celia. My soulmate. The woman whose love I'd spent my life earning.
It broke me. I cried until my head hurted.The pacing was amazing. It grab you from the beginning and lemme tell you tHAT THIS WAS ADDICTIVE. I wanted to know more and more, until I got to the end, until there was nothing but my broken heart and my tears falling on my shirt. The characters had an incredible an amazing development. You fall for most of them, and wanna kick many of them too. *cough* Don, Mick, Max. *cough*Evelyn is such a badass woman. A legend. An icon. Not just that. She was a wife, a mother, a lover, a friend. She was not just her talen and her great body.I fell in love with her and her story, with many of her husbands and her wife.My heart is broken tbh. But this book is totally worth of it.I laughed with Evelyn, I cried with and for her, I get angry and sad... I just fell.And the twist for Monique? Ugh, that ruined me as well.All the feelings in this book are deep and explores the sexuality and feelings of a woman who didn't know she could feel more for someone else than a man. And I'm glad that she and Celia got married at the end. :')Also, the rep biracial and latino was amazing. Luisa is from my country, El Salvador, and I will never stop bragging about it.I didn't know the complexity of this book, and the hype is worth it!!!ALL I KNOW IS THAT I WANT A CELIA ST. JAMES FOR ME, OK?____________________I'm a mess of tears right nowRTC"
2009,5.0,I finished this at 3am and then cried myself to sleep. This was truly remarkable. Evelyn Hugo is a character I won't get out of my head for a long time.

What a pleasant surprise! After dozens of unposted-unwritten reviews, finally an unposted-but-written one. Life is beautiful.But first off (I can call this first off if I freaking want to!!!) I wanna say: DON’T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT HISTORICAL FICTION CAN’T BE DIVERSE. Tell that anthropomorphized tennis ball they’re either uncreative or a secret bigot or a full-on dunce or ALL THREE. Because this book pulls it off with more than a tablespoon of grace, I’ll tell you that.My guy, there aren’t even that many characters in this book. And we’re following the majority of them starting in the 1950s. Not exactly, y’know, the peak of support for diversity in America. AND STILL WE DON’T LACK FOR REPRESENTATION. Do you get how great that is? I’m ready to punch the whitesplainers of Disney’s Frozen in their boring pale faces. The word “Frozen” is actually a reference to the lack of movement in the creativity centers of their brains. (Follow for more behind the scenes Disney-Pixar facts.)This book includes three (three!) interracial relationships. Actually, it’s more like ten if you count the fact that our protagonist is Latina. Yes! This may be the bare minimum, but I’m so used to YA wherein one pale as snow teen romances a - gasp - pale as paper teen! Diversity in young adult books = one character is of Western European descent and the other Eastern European. Talk about a vanilla romance. (Buh dum ch.)This book proves how important it is to provide diversity. The difference in the believability and intricacy of the story is incredible. I will say we don’t often get a good look at the variance in culture that comes with diversity here. Evelyn Hugo, though the daughter of Cuban immigrants, purposefully represses her heritage in order to fit in with the whitewashed 1950s and ’60s cinema scene. Our narrator, though half-black, expresses a fear that someone will tell her she’s “not black enough.” I wish the ethnic diversity played a little more into the text, but it didn’t feel unrealistic or anything. The reasoning was explained.But there’s even more diversity. Like, it gets even better. Because, again, despite the time setting, this book contains A SH*T TON of LGBT+ rep. And these are some of the most beautifully portrayed LGBT+ relationships I’ve ever read. If you don’t read this book for anything else, read it for that fine-ass inclusion, boi.Beyond that, this is the ultimate guilty pleasure book. IT IS SO FUN READING ABOUT OLD HOLLYWOOD AND OLD MOVIES. I wanted to watch the entire Evelyn Hugo canon after this, and then it was like, oh wait, she’s not real.I don’t have much else to say. This is chick-lit-y historical fiction at its finest. It’s just so fun. Some people say they got bored halfway through, and I get why you could, but I didn’t. I really fell in love with the world of this book, and the depiction of Old Hollywood, and all that jazz.A lot is revealed over the course of the book, and the best part is just being surprised at each twist and turn, so I don’t want to go to specifics even a little. I’m just going to cut off this review here before I risk, like, accidentally mentioning that Evelyn Hugo’s third husband turned her into a vampire and she was a vampire the whole time and she turns Monique at the end of the book.*Damn it!Bottom line: This is very fun and cool and maybe even important. Read it!!!*This isn’t true, by the way. Duh.----------------------This book? It's really great.I got a hell of a lot more than I bargained for. Not sure what the rating is - between 4 and 5 - but MAN I'm hype to write this review"
2011,4.0,"This has been one of the most well-developed, character driven stories that I’ve read. It’s the type that’ll leave a mark and I thoroughly enjoyed my reading experience. Throughout the course of this book, I became enamoured with Evelyn Hugo. She isn’t likeable, but I fell in love her. The whole story felt real. As if I could google one of her movies, and I’d be able to start watching it right away. I was dazzled by her beauty, her bravado. I fell in love with her personality, her ugliness and facade of a life she lived for a while, and how accepting she became of the mistakes she made. She learned from it. This is what you call learning from your mistakes, accepting them and moving on. She didn’t drown in regret, berate herself to the point where one can break oneself down. She dealt with her circumstances in the best way she could back then. She dealt with the cards that she was given in a way that made sense to her alone, but doesn’t condone it either. However, it was her truth and she was unapologetic. There was so much strength in her character that seeped into me. (And Hollywood is just fuckin’ dirty.) I also love the title of this book. I think anyone’s initial reaction is to be slightly shocked. I mean, I believed it. Evelyn Hugo really did marry seven men. But this story highlights that there is always more to someone than what meets the eye and what others may perceive. I don’t care how strong you are in your assumption towards someone. It’s an assumption, a so-called opinion and it’s flimsy at the of the day. The truth is that people are more complex, more layered and human. I think what I was missing though was the same type of intensity that I was feeling whilst reading the first half of the story - though I don’t know how much importance I should place on the ‘missing intensity’. But I also wished that the plot twist was looked at with more depth. It felt like the story ended almost abruptly once that reveal was made and I needed it to be more fleshed out and come round full circle. But other than that, Evelyn Hugo, you are an icon. ———————————The time has come for me to become acquainted with Evelyn Hugo."
2012,4.0,"4.5 stars but I very well may move it to a 5. This book was surprising, not in a “twist” way but in how so much of it resonated with me. I saw a lot of the “twists” coming but I believe that is entirely the point. It’s not about the twists, it’s about the journey and that is a marker for a great story imo. I desperately hope this gets made into a beautiful film. "
2013,5.0,"Best rereading choice for flashback Saturday is re-devouring my all time favorite TJR book! Evelyn Hugo a. k. a. Evelyn Elena Herrera is one of the most portrayed characters, a daughter of Cuban immigrants, raised in poverty. She’s not only beautiful, alluring but there’s something different about her: her energy is vivid, radiating. She knows what she wants for her life and she’s competitive and determined enough how she may get it by leaving her life in Hell’s Kitchen and moving to Los Angeles to become one of the movie stars, dying her hair, exposing her slender body, looking directly at the camera with her almond shaped eyes under her long lashes till the director tells her “cut”.  Now she’s 79, married SEVEN TIMES, a Hollywood legend, ready to share her life story and scandalous secret she kept for years. She befriends 35 years old Monique Grant, an unknown reporter works for “Vivant” in Los Angeles. Even the boss of Monique has no clue why this Hollywood legend demanded to work with her: she could choose someone more experienced, popular, known in the industry.So many question balloons start to fly above our heads:- Why Evelyn wants to talk only Monique and if she doesn’t, the memoir deal will be off?- Why Evelyn married seven times. Did she love any of her husbands? Does she have resentments? Does she suffer from heartbreak? Which one of is the love of her life? - As soon as their interview starts, Evelyn takes her an adventurous train ride with full of juicy, entertaining, heartbreaking, emotional stories starting from glamorous 60’s of La La Land, the productions of her famous movies, how her path crossed with those men, how she saved them and they saved her, how she got hurt, how she shone, how she burned… and eventually a big secret reveals about her life story which will change everything about true identity of Evelyn and the life choices she’s made! It’s brilliant! It’s unputdownable, addictive, heartfelt time travel in Hollywood. Author’s genuine approach to LGBTQ was better reflected than Ryan Murphy’s Hollywood limited series on Netflix. If you haven’t read it, don’t miss out this masterpiece and the best of the best Taylor Jenkins Reid book ( I liked it even more than Daisy Jones and the six) My favorite quotes:“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don’t do that.”“You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until somewhat stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”“Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”""Do you understand what I'm telling you? When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.”“…do yourself a favor and learn to grab life by the balls, dear. Don’t be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.”"

“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.”

 Let me go ahead and say that I had no idea what to expect from this book. When it first released, I remember seeing it everywhere, and I honestly didn’t take any interest in it until I was told about how diverse it was. It’s full of incredible representation: you’ve got bi rep, gay rep, lesbian rep, a Cuban woman, a biracial woman—so when I heard about all of that, I finally decided to give it a try, and I’m so glad that I did, because whatever I thought Evelyn Hugo was about, didn’t hold a candle to the experience of reading it for myself. 

“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”

Throughout the entire book, Evelyn is more or less laying her soul bare to Monique, this reporter who she’s asked to write her life story. As this famous actress, Evelyn’s memories are juicy and full of drama, hidden pains and secret triumphs, and most notably, her seven marriages—not one of them having been to the hidden love of her life. Despite the descriptions she gives for judgments she received and the snippets of gossip articles laid out intermittently through the book, Evelyn isn’t ashamed of herself in any way, and it creates this incredibly feminist, sex-positive atmosphere that I could’ve soaked in forever.

“I made it fifty-fifty. Which is about the cruelest thing you can do to someone you love, give them just enough good to make them stick through a hell of a lot of bad.”

Despite Evelyn’s status as this film goddess by this point, she feels so relatable and she manages to work even the celebrity aspects of her life into this narrative that anyone could understand, as she admits to the sins she committed and the lies she told, and even to the baser things like the fact that she realized early on, no amount of fame or fortune would ever truly satisfy a successful actress like herself. She constantly owns up to selfish motives and awful behaviors, yet she’s tremendously likable, and I think that’s a fact that points to how terrific Taylor Jenkins Reid’s storytelling is: because we are hearing everything through Evelyn’s memories, from the mouth of an elderly woman who has settled down and found peace, it makes it difficult to ever blame her for a single crime she committed.

“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.”

Of course, Evelyn’s not all bad—she overcame circumstances that many people would’ve simply given up under, and yet, she managed to love beautifully and to put her family first at every turn, even if the moves she made to protect them didn’t always make sense on the surface. Whether it’s her hidden love, or her endless commitment to her best friend, or her breathtaking adoration of her daughter, when you reach the end of the story and look back, it’s easy to see that nothing mattered more to Evelyn than the people she held dear, and it makes her feel spectacularly human.

“It’s a hard business, reconciling what the truth used to be with what the truth is now.”

Of course, Evelyn isn’t the only character who’s enjoyable in this book; underneath her memories is the story of Monique, the reporter who’s just trying to find her place in a world that doesn’t like to make room for strong women, much less women of color striking out on their own. She grows so much in a short span of time, and while the circumstances of the writing process aren’t always kind to her, and while she’s never really the star of the show, you can’t help but root for her, too—and everyone else in this complex, layered, masterpiece of a book.

“You have to find a job that makes your heart feel big instead of one that makes it feel small.”

I feel like there is so much more that I want to say, but at the end of the day, it all boils down to one thing: The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of the most brilliant pieces of writing I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It sets itself so solidly apart from anything I’ve ever read that even remotely resembled it, and is probably one of the most powerful, emotional, and incredible things I have ever read. I am forever grateful for each and every one of who you encouraged me to pick it up, and for Taylor Jenkins Reid, the genius behind the pages. I cannot recommend this highly enough.Buddy read with Meisha, Angie, and Delanna! ♥"
2015,5.0,"I’m just sobbing on my couch. No big deal. I’ve been emotionally gutted, but whatever. This book had two of the most wonderfully fascinating complex female characters I’ve ever had the pleasure of reading about, BUT ILL BE FINE"
2016,5.0,"REREAD 3/1/2019 i love this book so much i love this book so much i love this book so much THERE ARE TRULY NO WORDS FOR HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS BOOKand YES I cried just as much the second time. WHAT. ABOUT. IT::FULL REVIEW BELOW ::Folks, this book just came into my home and murdered me personally I’m shaking So, I literally cried for 20 minutes when listening this and not like cute little sniffles either I mean full on tears streaming down my face heaving sobs crying I'm talking having to keep wiping your eyes so you can see. I rarely get truly emotional in books so the fact this book drew that reaction from me is a testament to how fucking damn good it is. Like, please believe the hype peopleLike genuinely, I 100% believe if the fucking bus I was on had just HIT ME that would have been less painful then what happened in the last 20% of this bookanyway, it's like day 8 of trying to write this review but I keep restarting it because I don't know how to communicate how much I just loved this book so much but here goes. 
“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.” 
this is one of those books that you don't think you'll love so much and then it just surprises you and immediately steals your heart. 
⭐ it's so hard to explain what this book is about because it's so, so much more than I ever expected
On the basic level, it follows Monique, an up and coming journalist who has been invited to write a tell-all about the life of Evelyn Hugo. Evelyn Hugo is a retired Old Hollywood actress, fashion icon, sex symbol and known for her glamorous and scandalous life that included seven different marriages. Evelyn Hugo hasn't done an interview in decades but she insists that Monique write the tell-all and so the story is told both in flashbacks as Evelyn recounts her life through the seven marriages and current time as Monique tries to unravel why Evelyn Hugo, potentially the worlds most famous actress, wants her of all people to write this tell all. And listen, there is so, so much more happening then that but it's so, SO hard to explain. You just have to read it and trust me. Seriously I'm begging you, I'll go full Rumpelstiltskin and trade my first born for everyone to read this book because it is seriously incredible. 
“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”
I think one thing that is so amazing about this is how real it is even though all these characters are fictitious they feel SO REAL. They're so well developed and nuanced. Evelyn Hugo, Harry Cameron, Celia St James and the other characters who appear are incredibly flawed and did some questionable things (especially Evelyn) and I loved that about it so much. The depth that Taylor Jenkins Reid gave these characters made them feel so, so alive. And it also made the pain I felt at their struggles and their joys that much more real. This book absolutely broke me because I was SO, SO invested in these characters. I care about each one of them so much and even though eight days later I MISS them like they're real. I keep wondering what they're up to and how they're feeling. Because Taylor Jenkins Reid sets this book right in the heart of the old Hollywood era, and makes them so compelling and realistic, it honestly feels like they're real actresses and actors and producers and I have to keep reminding myself they're not. That sounds literally ridiculous but thats how WELL WRITTEN these characters are. 
“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.” 
despite the hetero sounding title, this book is very gay a large portion of this is about Evelyn Hugo explaining her love and on/off relationship with fellow actress Celia St. James. And oh my god, I love them so much. And I loved the representation so much.I've mentioned I'm queer here before and this book really had me thinking. The book explores a little what it was like to be queer in Hollywood in this era and what it cost both Evelyn and Harry to hide their relationships. The incorporation of events like the Stonewall riots and the AIDs crisis, and showing how the community reacted to that, was upsetting but important. And it really highlighted how hard it was to be gay or bi or lesbian like these characters at the time. I think that was just something really important in this book and again, brought it up a level from a regular literary fiction book to something a bit more. I also just really loved the bisexual rep. Like, a lot. So many things Evelyn said really hit home for me, and the tensions betwene her and Celia were really relatable because I've experienced that that too. This is not OwnVoices but I did read an article in which Taylor Jenkins Reid explained her research, and you can definitely tell she took her time to gather first person experience, read memoirs and generally research to make sure she was doing this right and she did it SO RIGHT. This is probably one of my favourite lgbtq+ books of all time
“But I like you this way. I like you impure and scrappy and formidable. I like the Evelyn Hugo who sees the world for what it is and then goes out there and wrestles what she wants out of it. So, you know, put whatever label you want on it, just don't change. That would be the real tragedy.”
Okay, I'm getting emotional again so lets leave it here. I love these messy, beautiful characters so much and I just ..... my heart is exploding thinking about all the HAPPINESS they deserved. If you think this book is something you won't like, I did too. I thought there was no way I would care about a literary fiction book focussing on Hollywood but OH. MY. gOD. It's so much more than you think it is and it truly both made and broke my heart. this is one of my favourite 2018 reads and also a new all time favourite, and I am so, so happy it exists."
2017,5.0,"”People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is ‘your safe with me’, that’s intimacy”.Este libro es una absoluta maravilla. Me fascina ese momento en el que acabo una historia y me quedo encantada con todo lo que acabo de leer. Sobre todo porque, si les soy sincera, no esperaba que este libro fuera de mi tipo. ¡Y ahora no puedo dejar de pensar en Evelyn Hugo! En Los Siete Maridos de Evelyn Hugo nos topamos con una mujer de lo más peculiar. Evelyn Herrera creció en Hell’s Kitchen, en medio de una familia difícil, así que su sueño siempre fue salir de allí y encontrar el estrellato en Hollywood. Desde muy pequeña siempre supo que estaría dispuesta a hacer lo que fuera con tal de lograr su sueño, y vaya que sí nos lo demuestra a lo largo de las páginas. Muchísimos años después, a punto de cumplir los 80 y habiéndose retirado hace décadas del cine, Evelyn Hugo contacta a Monique Grant, periodista junior de una de las mejores revistas de Nueva York, porque finalmente quiere contar toda la verdad sobre los rumores, sus siete matrimonios y, por encima de todo, sobre el amor de su vida. Así es como empieza un relato apasionante, descarnado y tan real que es imposible que no te toque alguna fibra sensible. La historia de Evelyn Hugo es aquella de las mujeres que quieren triunfar en Hollywood y que han entendido que, lastimosamente, la entrada a este mundo y los grandes papeles no se ganan sólo con talento. Es la historia de una mujer que, dejando de lado los juicios morales, supo jugar las fichas en un gran tablero de ajedrez que le valió la fama y el reconocimiento que siempre quiso. Pero también es la historia de una persona profundamente herida y obligada a esconder la parte de sí misma que más felicidad y satisfacción le generaba. Este es el relato de una mujer fuerte, decidida, tenaz, manipuladora, amorosa y talentosa a más no poder que siempre soñó con ser libre. Al leer este libro me sentí un poco voyeur, pues realmente era una historia que se sentía tremendamente real, a pesar de que Evelyn Hugo no lo sea. Con cada página que pasaba me daba la sensación de estar enterándome del chisme que siempre quise saber, pero nunca lo supe. Taylor Jenkins Reid maneja la narración de tal manera que te enganchas desde el momento cero. Desde las primeras palabras que le dice Evelyn a Monique quieres saber cómo una niña de 14 años logró salir de Hell’s Kitchen y llegar a Los Angeles, cómo consiguió su primer papel, cuál es la verdad sobre cada uno de sus siete matrimonios. Es que quieres saberlo todo sobre una persona que no sabías que existía y que, de hecho, no lo hace. Es un fenómeno tremendo y adictivo. Evelyn Hugo y su vida te seducen de tal manera que es imposible parar de leer. Vamos a ver si puedo hablar de esto con la menor cantidad de spoilers posible. Los Siete Maridos de Evelyn Hugo es un libro LGBTIQA+ y la historia en la que se enmarca esa representación es una de las mejores que he leído. No sólo se abordan ciertas cuestiones como el borrar por completo una identidad, sino también lo difícil que era para las personas del siglo pasado (pre Stonewall) el aceptarse a ellas mismas. Hoy en día leemos historias de aceptación y de coming of age y, aunque no puede ser fácil para nadie salir del closet y aceptar su identidad, imaginen cómo era ese proceso en los años 50s en Estados Unidos, cuando el que a una persona le gustara otra de su mismo sexo se consideraba pecado, enfermedad mental, desviación. Y todos esos matices los encontramos narrados en este libro de una forma magistral. Además de todo esto, la narración de Evelyn logra que amemos y odiemos a los personajes que ella ama y odia. No voy a entrar en detalles, eso sí que serían spoilers, pero creo que nunca voy a olvidar a Celia, a Harry, a Monique, a Connor y a Evelyn misma. Las vidas de estos personajes se entrelazaron en momentos difíciles y felices, en lugares y años en los que no les convenía y en otros en los que sí, pero, al final, crearon una historia memorable y que resonará incluso después de que cierres las páginas del libro. Y me queda hablarles del final… wow. Como todo en Los Siete Maridos de Evelyn Hugo es maravilloso. Cuando todo se cierra y te enteras de aquello que conectaba a Evelyn y a Monique quedas de piedra. Es la última pieza que le faltaba al puzzle para que encajara. Ese momento de la verdad es tan crudo y duro que es, definitivamente, uno de los puntos altos del libro. ¡Y eso que hemos vivido todo el drama y la montaña rusa que ha sido la vida de estrella de Hollywood de Evelyn Hugo! Además, cuando piensas que esa revelación será el punto épico con el que cerrará el libro… bueno, Monique y nosotros como lectores entendemos cómo realmente va a acabar esta historia. Evelyn Hugo siempre tomó fuerte las riendas de su vida y es algo que nunca dejó de hacer. El final es duro, agridulce y muy, muy liberador."

I had learned all too well that pain was sometimes stronger than the need to keep up appearances.

You can’t deny the fact that The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of the most praised books in this community, and, generally, around the book community, and for quite good reason. There's never a day this book doesn’t pop up in my Goodreads feed. There's even a compilation of Booktube going crazy over this, and I finally get it.There isn't a lot I could say about this that hasn't been said, but I'll try.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo follows Cuban-American Evelyn Herrera, who later changes her name to Evelyn Hugo, telling us her story with a set of recordings by Monique Grant. Monique is a writer for Vacant, and when Evelyn herself says she will not let anyone interview her unless it's Monique, she knows it's a big deal. In her process of interviewing Evelyn, she tells her everything. And I mean, everything, starting off when she was a little girl living in Hell's Kitchen to becoming Hollywood's highest-paid actress. And of course, she tells everyone the journey of being married seven times, to seven different husbands. She tells Monique her journey of becoming one of the most iconic women. She tells the world her secrets. But as Evelyn is telling Monique everything the world is dying to know, she begins to see that there is more that connects the two than just an interview.

When you dig just the tiniest bit beneath the surface, everyone's love life is original and interesting and nuanced and defies any easy definition.

I may still be too young to say, but marriage sounds too complex, responsible, stressful, and quite . . . boring, even. While I hear about marriages completing 50 or more years, and while it sounds adorable and beautiful, marriage sounds too complicated for me. I look at my parents marriage as an example and ask myself ”Do I want that?” Don’t get me wrong. They’re in a healthy relationship, but sometimes it feels as if there could be more.My dad reminds me of something we both see a lot in people we know. The couple is doing perfectly fine, and it isn’t until they marry that they begin to see each other’s true colors. Years pass, years of love and lust, years of denial and arguments, and it leads to divorcement. We’ve heard too many stories of the same reasons, and my dad reminds me of why marriage was never something he wanted. Marriage is such a complicated thing, and I see it as both an issue and a desire. Reading about Evelyn’s 7 different marriage experiences reminds me why I’m scared of marriage. How do you know the person you’re marrying is the one? Do you ever know? Or do you only desire the feeling of marriage? Are you marrying out of love, or are you marrying because you need to? What about the promises made, the vows you said? Does all that not mean anything anymore once the first broken promise settles in? People marry for different reasons, but are all those reasons worth it? This will be something I will never know, or maybe, I will. I can’t predict my future and say, but I do know that it’s a scary thing.

Some marriages aren't really that great. Some loves aren't all-encompassing. Sometimes you separate because you weren't that good together to begin with. Sometimes divorce isn't an earth-shattering loss. Sometimes it's just two people waking up out of a fog.

Evelyn is described, by many, as complex and unapologetic, and I think that's a fair and perfect description for her character. She makes decisions that the reader will hate, but since she's telling Monique (and us) her story, and is letting us know what and why led to that decision-making, it's difficult to blame her for it. To be honest, Evelyn is irritable. She's sour from the beginning, and as we meet her with Monique, we can already tell that she is confident, even if some would take her as selfish. But Evelyn is just that: confident. She knows this, and she's not afraid to admit it. But her confidence is what brings the people to think differently about her. Evelyn is unapologetic in the sense that she won't take no for an answer, and she will decide on what she will act on, perform, and do. I say Evelyn is a character some may find hating themselves for loving her because of her attitude. She’s sharp-tongued, quick to defend herself, and will not take no for an answer. But I think that is also why many love her. She knows her chances of getting what she wants, and when the opportunities present themselves, she takes the advantage of them. She knows about her beauty, and she uses it as an advantage. She knows the effect she has on men and how much power she holds over them, so she uses that part of herself to earn herself promotion, advertisement, and, of course, lust. Evelyn’s decision-making comes to make sense the more we meet her, and as she unfolds her story to Monique, so many more things start making sense. Evelyn is sexualized since the beginning, and she's only seen for her body. She knows this, and she holds it to be a part of her. She's not seen for the real person she is. She hides every part of herself, not only her love for her wife, but her personal identity: a bisexual Cuban woman.I think what made Evelyn feel more real to me was how easy she trusted people, especially with herself. She offered herself, but she did it because she knew if she didn't, she wouldn't manage to continue going forward. She had her epiphanies too late into the lives of the people she loved, and it shows the message of how short life is and how you’ll regret the time you spent adapting to societal norms instead of showing everyone the real you. The world is a scary place, and sometimes, all you can think of is pleasing the world while ignoring your own self. You put the world, the audience, before you, and it starts to make you realize how you were doing everything because of them, never because of you.While homophobia is never actually explained nor shown in the book, the reader can sense it with how Evelyn and Celia react to their relationship. When you look back at the 80s, you can’t really find the best support of the LGTBQ+ community, let alone the 70s, 60s, and 50s, which was why I supported Evelyn in everything she did. I was mad at myself for sympathizing with Evelyn, but how could I not? I didn’t understand Evelyn, and couldn’t grasp the fact that she wouldn’t “come out” and be unafraid like Celia, but it’s more than that. It isn’t easy being part of the LGBTQ+ community now, even in 2021, so we can only imagine how people in the 50s and later on felt. While there have been incredible and numerous changes, discrimination and harassment continue.Celia and Evelyn have to hide themselves and their relationship, and it doesn’t take until 2017 for Evelyn to finally tell someone else that Celia was the love of her life, for her to admit she was in love with a woman. They regret the time they didn’t spend together, the time they spent separated, mad at each other, but just as Evelyn reassured Celia that it wasn’t her fault, it really wasn’t. The two put everything at stake when being together, but their entire life would be at risk. People would talk, they would judge, and they would assume. Word would spread easily, and the two would be placed in different situations of both judgment and support.I feel like the relationship between Celia and Evelyn is one of the most difficult and beautiful relationships I’ve read about, simply because of the portrayal of it. The two ache and yearn for each other, and the reader aches and yearns for them to be together. 

I have been married seven times, and never once has it felt half as right as this. I think that loving you has been the truest thing about me.

But, while Evelyn found herself in love with Celia, Celia was also a friend of Evelyn, and the second-chance family Evelyn found herself in with her, Harry, and Connor, her daughter, was beautiful but sad to witness developing. Evelyn thought she had it all: fame, money, a mansion. She was a legend and icon everywhere she stepped foot in, but her human connection to the most important people in her life was slowly disappearing. Evelyn’s been through a lot, especially with her marriages, and it makes a huge impact on who she becomes in the future.The only problem I found in this was the plot twist that connected Monique and Evelyn in ways some may have not expected. I honestly found it to be unnecessary, if I’m being honest. I didn’t think it added much emotion to the story. I feel like the author could have taken a different approach to adding a twist to the story. All in all, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is worth the hype. It's the book every daughter and mom are talking about for good reason. It's full of love and lust, heartbreak, and decisions that could lead you to lose everyone you love most in your life. It's a reminder to live your life for yourself, not for others.I may have not exactly loved this as much as I thought I would, but it's still a book I would recommend to people.

To Evelyn. Who has lit up every goddamn room she ever walked into. And who, day after day, makes us feel like we're living in a dream.

2019,5.0,"4.5 starsDon't read this book on your period. Just don't. Take my advice. Spare yourself the grief and agony.Every time I closed this book and my brain snapped back to the present, it took me a couple of seconds to remember that Evelyn isn’t a real person. A fictional biography is such a genius idea, and it was done so expertly. I have zero interest in movies or Hollywood (cite literally any tweet about me hating watching movies and not caring about actors), but this book and the setting and characters enchanted me. I wanted to turn on La Vie En Rose in the background as I read it just to get in the Mood.This is the first book I’ve read in a while where I sat and read without touching my phone for 2+ hours, praying that time would pass slower so I could fit in more pages before I had to go to sleep. Part of why I was so addicted is because the writing of this book just demands attention. It’s flowing almost to the point of conversational, more like a memoir than a novel. And although I flew through the prose, part of me questions whether the flashback sections resemble the tone and voice of an older Hollywood star. A lot of the lingo and style of relating a story seemed modern, and maybe I’m just overthinking, but it took away a bit from the authenticity of the story for me. Maybe it would have worked better being told in third person as if it were Monique's writing, but something about the voice of Evelyn's memories didn't sit right with me.I like how this book uses the perspective of hindsight. Evelyn using her wisdom to call out when she was being mistreated and all the unjust and toxic things that occurred to her constructed a powerful narrative. I applaud this book talking about feminism, abusive relationships, abortions, and bisexual erasure, among plenty other things. I can see why it's highly praised in that respect. The discussion of moral greyness and the corruption and scheming of Hollywood and fame and unabashed conceit and fame was also fascinating. I love the light in which it was painted. It was very take it or leave it, which was so different because usually, books do the most to try and convince you of a character being starkly good or bad. This book let you assume whatever you wanted to about the characters, which I respected.Lastly, the most satisfying thing about this book is watching the growth of Monique alongside Evelyn telling her story. Being honest, I didn't think I was going to like Evelyn at first, but I realized the same quality that makes her a rude and off-putting character also makes her powerful and memorable. I grew to love her snark and confrontational dialogue, even though I would likely be terrified of her in person.It's hard to wrap up this review because I want to say that I loved it as much as everyone else, but I can't quite put my finger on why it wasn't a full five stars. Still, I highly recommend it."
2020,5.0,Excuse me I am so emotional this was one of the best books I have ever read in my entire life
2021,5.0,"5 glamorous, glitzy, enamored beyond all reason stars!!!Full review featured on my blog Recipe & a Read along with a recipe for Caldo Gallego soup!My life has been broken up into two segments: before Evelyn and after.Where do I even start with this? If all of my enthusiasm and relentless energy could be compressed into a grenade I would pull the pin out for The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and burst into a show of sparkles and champagne bubbles. I don't even know how to concisely put into words how much this book did the damn thing for me.So do yourself a favor and learn how to grab life by the balls, dear. Don't be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.Evelyn Hugo. She's a magnetic, luscious, complicated and layered character beyond all reason. How Reid was able to fit such a huge personality into only 386 pages is honestly beyond me. I didn't just want to read about Evelyn, I wanted to know her. I want to bask in her greatness, revel in her strengths and ponder her weaknesses and lessons with her.It's always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.Evelyn Hugo. She spent her entire life working tirelessly and mercilessly to fight her way to the top of the food chain during the Golden Age of Hollywood. She's nearing the end of her life and she's finally ready to tell all about her triumphs and failures and she chooses a down-on-her-luck, little-known, surprise-to-everyone writer named Monique Grant to tell that story.All I've ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. But you've never been mine. Not really. I've always had to settle for one piece of you. While the world gets the other half. I don't blame you. It doesn't make me stop loving you. But I can't do it. I can't do it, Evelyn. I can't live with my heart half-broken all the time.EVELYN FREAKIN' HUGO. Her story resonated with me and spoke lessons to me I didn't even realize I needed. Evelyn simply wants what most of us do, she wants to be seen. It is an ache within in her that transcends the words on the page and nestles itself into the heart of the reader.While this is told from Monique's POV, Evelyn is the one weaving the tale. When Monique learns that Evelyn is ready to give a tell-all interview to her and her alone we see many parallels between these two women. Monique has her own lessons to learn, her own battles to fight and Evelyn unknowingly turns into a guiding light in Monique's life.Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn't like to to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?It was truly effortless to love Evelyn and this cast of characters. At it’s heart this is a love story, a tale of redemption and a saga of loss and heartbreak. It tackles an insane amount of timely topics with a deft and delicate hand. Reid has truly outdone herself. This book takes homophobia, racism, sexism, trauma, abuse and a whole lot more and highlights and honors the struggles of those experiencing these ugly truths of our society.This book. Who am I now? What do I do with my life in this new stage of After Evelyn? This is easily the newest member of my favorites shelf and my new go-to recommendation for other readers. This book isn't hyped, it's properly praised for the literary masterpiece it is. I'm now facing one of the worst book hangovers of my life because I'm not ready to say goodbye to Evelyn and her story. Reid crafted Evelyn’s character in a way that those around her could never get enough and she did so in such a spectacularly efficient fashion that readers wont be able to either. Evelyn always leaves you hoping you'll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.Pick it up, I suggest this for anyone with the capability of reading or absorbing literature through any medium. I'll just be over here, weeping quietly at the beauty and magnificence that was this story."
2022,5.0,"5 StarsI waited until the hype died down to read this...and I’m so glad it lived up to it. Evelyn was such a tangible character. She just bounded off the page and, while I may not have always liked her...I loved her all the same. I also really enjoyed Reid's writing. The format was great and it flowed so effortlessly. And, I know I'm super late to read this...so that’s it."
2023,5.0,"Redownloaded the audiobook - Is it too soon to read this again??? Reviews can be found at: www.booknerdtan.wordpress.comNo doubt...5/5 stars.... Read from start to finish and reviewed in one day, if that doesn't say everything I don't know what will. This review will probably just be a load of rambling nonsense as I'm writing it straight after finishing the book and I'm overwhelmed with what I've just read. I loved everything about this wonderful story; the well developed characters, the juicy plot, the interesting way in which it was written and the twist that I never saw coming- all of this from the very start had me totally hooked. To be totally honest, I picked this up because I wanted some light hearted chic lit and whoa did I get way more than I bargained for.I think what hit me the most about this book was how much I felt for every character in it and the relationships that Evelyn built with them. The different types of connections and love you can feel for others really resonated and the characters just felt so real to me. I think maybe after everything Evelyn Hugo did throughout her life, we should feel some kind of animosity towards her, however I cannot help but absolutely adore her and everything she did for herself and others.The entire story from start to finish was so captivating, juicy and dramatic that I managed to finish it in one day as it completely consumed me and I wasn't able to do anything else all day. I loved the way there were articles and reports about Evelyn throughout her career entwined in the story, it really added to the way the story was delivered. I loved the way sexuality was addressed with such raw honesty and transparency and gave some insight into just how far people will go for the people they love.The ending to the book was just beautiful and brought all the tears. This may be my favourite book of 2018 so far. A book I can say is actually worth all the hype that is surrounding it and my heart feels a lot more full right now. What a stunning book."

2025,5.0,"I can’t believe I am saying this but this is my 1,500 review on Goodreads! (Skip down two paragraphs if you want to start the actual review) If you would have told me back in early 2016, when I first joined Goodreads, that I would write this many reviews I would have laughed hysterically. I joined this site because my memory is like a sieve and I could not keep track of all the books I read. But the real reason I stayed and reached 1,500 is because of the people on this site. While many people have come and gone over the years, this little corner of Goodreads (fans of LGBTQ+ fiction) have just been so wonderfully kind and fun to be a part of. I just want to thank all of my friends and followers, and everyone who has taken the time to comment or even like one of my reviews. I honestly would not keep writing these reviews without you all. You make Goodreads a place that I want to keep coming back to and be a part of. And a big thank you to everyone who rates and or reviews books too. I like reading reviews and it’s been fun watching my to read list grow into a giant from the books you all have recommended over the years. I don’t know if I will make it to 2,000 reviews. It would take me years to hit that number and we all know life gets in the way, so I’m going to enjoy this 1,500 review milestone and you all have my sincere thanks.Over the past few weeks I’ve been thinking about what to read as my 1,500 book review. I wanted a book that would feel special and that would hopefully be a book I really liked or even loved. It’s really hard to get a sure thing when it comes to books since we all have such personal tastes. I figured I had to go for a hype book, but choosing this particular one was not easy. I think a book can have almost too much hype and I felt like this book was in that territory for me. It’s weird, but if everyone tells me to do something, I start thinking I don’t want to do it. That’s what happened with Evelyn Hugo. Everyone told me to read this, everyone told me I would love it, and I started to pull back from it. Plus, it didn’t help that an ex-girlfriend of mine was obsessed with this book –and had really pushed it on me to read when we were together- so it just tainted it even more. But time passed and I still kept seeing this book on my feed as people keep reading it and loving it. This summer was truly rare if I could go even a week without seeing something about this book, so it has never left my mind. And then a few weeks ago I was listening to a podcast of favorite summer reads and once again, there was Evelyn Hugo. It just seems sort of like fate that a book I should have read years ago, was going to be my 1,500 review. Well here it is:There has been a ton of reviews for this book already so I’m just going to comment on a few things that stuck-out to me. I think what surprised me the most was my feelings about Evelyn Hugo. This book is so talked about that I knew that many readers did not like Evelyn or even downright hated her character. I was surprised that I didn’t feel the same way. I felt like I understood her and dare I say I even liked Evelyn a bit. Yes, she takes advantage of people and did whatever it took to protect her family, but it always seemed true to her character. I think it is a testament to Reid’s writing that I was able to sympathize with Evelyn (although Evelyn would have hated to have been sympathized) and that I clearly understood where her motivations where coming from. Evelyn is a very interesting character that is easy to dislike, but she ended up being so well written that I’m kind of team Evelyn anyway. I do have to mention that some of the big plot points are a bit predictable. It is not had to guess how the main love story arc will flow and the main twists are pretty obvious. While this might have normally bothered me, at the end of the day I honestly didn’t care. This book was hearty in length, so it took me two sittings to finish, but that was only because I had to stop reading at 4am to go to sleep. I would have kept reading because I was so engrossed in this world. Not only was I completely into Evelyn’s story, I liked the smaller current story of the author writing her book. There were so many times that this book could have slow-down and dragged, but it never felt like that to me. Once I started reading I was hooked, and I didn’t care one bit if some of it was a bit predictable. Reid writes so well that it just didn’t matter. I think it is obvious from all the other reviews but this is a tear-jerker at times. At first I was actually surprised how much I was reading and never needed a tissue, well that was true for the first two thirds. Once the last third starts, I picked the tissues up and didn’t put them down for the rest of the book. This book is very sad, and it almost felt too sad and too much at one point, but I was still okay with that part of the story. I was satisfied with how Evelyn’s love story was written which was a big part of enjoying the story for me. So sad yes, but I think the story is still fulfilling for the reader.This ended up being the right pick for a review that means a lot to me. I was hoping for at least a good 4 star read, but this was an excellent 5 star read so I could not be happier. This really was a classic Hollywood drama at its best, but the fact the main character was a bisexual woman made it even better. Reid is a very talented writer and even though some of her other books might not fall into my preferred genres, I will still have to read more by her. This is a book extremely easy to recommend, just have the tissues ready."
2026,5.0,"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a 2017 Atria Books publication.A story so well written I had to remind myself it was a work of fiction. The cleverly titled novel appealed to my interest in old Hollywood, the scandals and cover-ups the public never had the slightest clue existed. Evelyn Hugo is a faded movie star in advanced years who has decided to write her life story- a deliciously scandalous tell all with a sharp focus on her seven marriages. To help with this task, she lures Monique Grant to her home under false pretenses, but soon seduces her into agreeing to take the job, by making her an offer she couldn’t resist. The story moves slowly at first while Evelyn settles into her story and Monique learns how to handle Evelyn, often using Evelyn’s own advice against her to gain leverage. But, once they have come to an understanding, Evelyn’s story takes center stage and what a story it was. The first question Monique asked Evelyn is:‘Who was the great love of your life?'It seems like a reasonable enough question, considering Evelyn’s numerous marriages, but it turns out to be much more complicated than what it may seem on the surface. I admit, I sat literally spellbound and mesmerized by Evelyn and her turbulent life as an actress and movie star, and the amazing twists and turns her life took in search of personal peace, love, and contentment. Her storytelling was an Academy Award performance. Evelyn made concessions along the way to fame, allowing herself to be recreated by erasing her Cuban heritage and features, as well as leaving her first husband for a chance at fame and fortune. Her love life takes many twists and turns as does her career, but what the public witnessed was nothing at all like what went on behind closed doors. Her life was like the old Hollywood is all ‘smoke and mirrors’ adage personified.While Monique is the interviewer, her life and background deserves a close look. She is depressed over her failed marriage and her seemingly dead -end position at work. This gig is worth the incredible risk she takes, but she could never have guessed the monumental impact Evelyn Hugo would have on her life. Naturally, I thought of Elizabeth Taylor and her many marriages, but the story also had a hint of Marilyn Monroe’s humble beginnings as well. However, a few of Evelyn's leading men mimicked or could have been modeled after real movie stars from that era as well.  But, the most significant points come from the relationships Evelyn developed, outside of the public eye, and how they managed to keep the situation a secret for so many years. Each husband is given their own chapter with a special title that applies to them personally or to Evelyn’s relationship or opinion of them. I disliked many of them, and really loved others, as did Evelyn. But beware of Evelyn’s spin on things. She is determined to tell this tale her way and her outlook is often a matter of perspective. As things progress, I began to see how Evelyn’s influence on Monique begins to take hold. She gives good advice even if it sounds selfish, greedy, or cold. She didn’t get to be the great ‘Evelyn Hugo’ without some verve. Although there are strong passages regarding sexuality, and the hidden secret lives people were forced to resort to in those days, for me, the powerful transformation Monique undergoes under Evelyn’s tutelage is what sticks with me the most. Now, this story could have worked as a fictional tell all from Hollywood’s golden age, but there are a couple of 'Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night'moments you won’t see it coming, which left me utterly speechless and completely flabbergasted. My emotions exploded in a million different directions at that point. The conclusion is riddled with rich bittersweet irony, but couldn't have been more fitting. Overall, this is an incredibly well written story, very atmospheric, multi-layered, thought provoking, and utterly hypnotizing. Someday, I would like to re-read this one so I can absorb all those nuances I missed leading up to that stunning conclusion. This one was so good I had a little book hangover for a couple of days. Highly recommend!!"

 4,75 stars
It's safe to say that I loved this book. How can I not love this? It's like watching a beautiful black and white movie where every character is complex, painfully human and most importantly NOT STRAIGHT.After hating so many hyped books lately, I'm happy to say that: 
The hype is deserved!
 It's even deserving of more hype. I loved how beautiful this book was and I'm not talking about the writing. It's the sadness and pain that brings this book to life and even more than that: The Characters.Evelyn Hugo is ready to bare it all in this book. I wanted to take all the secrets she revealed, keep them close to my chest and protect them from this ugly reality. She's complex. She's cruel. She's passionate. She's human. And if you don't understand all of her. You don't desreve to love her. And God Did I fall head over heels for her! She's hands down:  The best female character I've ever read about.On her way to fame, she lost so much of herself. Hurt so many people. And she's completly unapologetic. Married seven guys yet loved only one person. Someone she wasn't allowed to have. But who she loved anyway. If love is the only word to express what they felt for each other than that's what we will call it, even if it was so much more.Harry, her best friend is my spirit animal. Celia, with all of her passion is someone I would've loved to get to know.I loved every character except for: Monique. The journalist. If she's a journalist I should be an author by now. How can someone be so stupid, is beyond me.This book will break you in all the right ways. But you will be happy that you've read something so beautiful. I definitely recommend this to everyone.
Thank you for reading this review! and I hope you have an amazing life.

2028,5.0,I literally have nothing else to say other than omfg I loved this so much
2029,5.0,"I just finished rereading this book and I just loved it so much. I listened to the audiobook, which is great by the way - and I cried so much at the end again. I love this story so much, I love that Evelyn is imperfect and real and she makes mistakes but she’s such an interesting, complex character. And her love story is one of my all time favorites. I actually really enjoyed Moniques chapters in this book this time as well, the first time I wasn’t as interested in them because I wanted to get back to Evelyns story, but this time I really just loved it all. This book is one of my absolute all time favorites. FULL BOOK TALK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujeXq...HUGE THANK YOU to Atria Books for sending me an ARC.I can honestly say I've never read a book like this before. This story is so incredibly unique and original and heart breaking and beautiful. Taylor Jenkins Reid has been one of my favorite authors recently, and this book is even better than I imagined it would be. This is unlike any of her other books, and unlike anything I've even read. I loved reading about the scandal and craziness of being an actress in the 1950's movie scene. I loved reading about Evelyn's romance and heart break and her incredible life story. I started reading it this morning and literally couldn't put it down, hours later I was in tears and finished the story and I feel like I'll never forget these characters and how this story has affected me. This story is so much more than just the life story of a Hollywood actress. It's incredibly moving, and emotional; everything you would expect from a Taylor Jenkins Reid novel and more.I loved everything about this book. Taylor Jenkins Reid is the queen."
2030,5.0,All the mess in the fictional world is not bad. It made me die while I was alive reading this one.***The only book which made me Google the character because I was damn sure she walked on this Earth.
2031,5.0,"Reread 31st May 2021 Review:Loved this book just as much the second time around. Broke my heart all over again and left me feeling devastated that Evelyn Hugo isn’t a real life person. Didn’t expect to cry as much again, since I knew what was coming, but no I still sobbed again. Cannot recommend this book enough!First read 31 August 2018 Review:LOVE WHEN NOBODY WARNS ME THAT THIS BOOK WILL BREAK MY HEART 😩💔 CW: Homophobia/Biphobia, domestic abuse, death, suicide, cancer If that doesn’t let you know how I feel about this book then I don’t know what will. I cried multiple times and I wasn’t ready! This book was so interesting to me and Evelyn’s character is just so fascinating! I kept reading because I just wanted to know more about her life! This just shows how good the writing was in my opinion. This book also reminded me HUGELY of “The Devil Wears Prada”, as I found Evelyn to be so similar to Miranda (Meryl Streep’s character) and Monique to be similar to Andrea (Anne Hathaway’s character). Overall I absolutely loved this book and I’m so glad I read it! Definitely gonna be one of my favorite reads by the end of the year!"

I loved every single thing about Taylor Jenkins Reid's The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. I had been meaning to read it since it was published last year, but something else always popped up in front of it, until I decided I needed to see what everyone was raving about. And boy, did I ever!!Evelyn Hugo is a film legend. She is an Academy Award-winning actress, a philanthropist, a fashion icon, and, at her heyday, was one of the most stunningly beautiful women in the world. She retired from film in the late 1980s and mostly stayed out of the spotlight, enduring her share of tragedies. But her mystique still lingers.When she decides to auction off some of her most iconic gowns to raise funds for charity, Evelyn also decides it's time to give an interview. She chooses to tell her story to Vivant magazine, but demands that a reasonably unknown reporter, Monique Grant, be the one to interview her. No one, Monique included, understands why Evelyn has chosen her, but the actress is utterly unwavering in her demand.When Monique meets Evelyn, she is dazzled by her beauty, but is moved by her strength and her kindness. Evelyn isn't actually interested in giving an interview to Vivant—she wants Monique to write her biography, publishable after her death, and wants Monique to make a fortune once it's time to make a publishing deal. Although she can't figure out why Evelyn would give this prize to her, and she knows it could endanger her job, Monique jumps at the chance to hear the legend's life story in her own words.""When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.""In Evelyn's luxurious Manhattan penthouse apartment, she begins unfurling her rise to fame, from growing up in Hell's Kitchen in the 1950s to making her way to Hollywood, from getting her start in movies to her decision to leave acting 30+ years later. Of course, she lays bare the stories behind her seven marriages and the men she took into her life, and the scandals, happy moments, and pain that accompanied those relationships. Evelyn gives Monique the unvarnished truth and doesn't want to be portrayed as a good person—she knows she was ruthlessly ambitious, hurtful, calculating, and unwavering in getting what she wanted. But at one point, she was the highest paid actress in Hollywood, and her intelligence and ambition helped get her there.As Monique listens to Evelyn's story, and is moved by the complexities of her emotions, she has her own emotional challenges to figure out as well. And as Evelyn's journey helps shape her own decisions, she still wonders why the actress chose her. But Evelyn also helps change Monique's frame of reference in certain ways, how she thinks of situations and people.""It's always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is compulsively readable, like one of those television miniseries you can't stop watching. I'm a huge movie fan and love reading stories of ""old Hollywood,"" and Reid captures that mood and environment so perfectly. But this is more than a soapy melodrama—this is a book with surprising depth, thought-provoking in the subjects it touches on, and unapologetic in its portrayal of what women needed to do to succeed in Hollywood.Reid is an amazing storyteller. I know many have spoken highly of her earlier books and I'm going to have to check those out. But this book was fantastic from start to finish. I devoured the whole book in just a few hours because I couldn't get enough of it, but of course, I'm sad now that it's over. This was a terrific story of love, loss, self-reliance, and the struggle of being true to yourself and having to adhere to the roles society puts you in.Pick this one up!See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com, or check out my list of the best books I read in 2017 at https://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com/2018/01/the-best-books-i-read-in-2017.html."
2033,4.0,"I'm not sure that I can add any original thoughts on this iconic novel, as many people before me have said the things much more eloquently than I can, but this was certainly worth the effort of experiencing. I had tried to get into this one a couple of times prior, but I just couldn't connect with the audio version and the timing wasn't right in the past. After a tumultuous trial period, I found that sometimes the timing needs to be just right to enjoy a book to the fullest, and I'm glad I was finally able to experience Evelyn in her full glory. "

2035,5.0,One of the most beautiful and heartbreaking books I've ever read. I haven't cried that hard while reading a book in a long time. Definitely a new favorite of mine. 
2036,5.0,"Well, I’m certainly late to the party, but glad I showed up! The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is well-worth all of the hype it’s received over the past couple of years. It was a dramatic and engaging book, and I loved it. The story focuses on an older Evelyn telling the story of her life to 35 year old writer, Monique, who works at a magazine in NYC. Monique wants more for herself and is intrigued as to why Evelyn sought her out, specifically, for this opportunity. Most of the book is told through Evelyn’s first person POV of the past, with small snippets of Monique’s present day POV interspersed throughout. It was an interesting story that hooked me right away. Seven husbands is undoubtedly excessive but I had to see who they were, why Evelyn married them, and why they didn’t work out. I was also dying to know why Evelyn chose Monique for this memoir opportunity. Evelyn was a NY-born actress who wanted “more” and wanted a better life; she was dying to escape Hell’s Kitchen and did whatever she needed to in order to make it to Hollywood. She adjusted her image to fit in yet always stood out. Self-confidence was a non-issue for her. Along the way, Evelyn meets many men and her relationships with them often shaped the course of her life, both personal and professional. I didn’t particularly find her character to be likable, yet I was so engrossed in the story, I didn’t care, and had to see what would happen next. That said, I easily felt like Evelyn could be a real person and this could have been a true story, not just fictional. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a story about life, love, loss, and the sacrifices we sometimes make for those we love. Taylor Jenkins Reid is quite the writer and I will definitely be reading more from her soon."

“Evelyn has never needed saving from anyone.”
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is phenomenal. The Seven Husbands if Evelyn Hugo is a masterpiece. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is emotional and meaningful.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo deserves all the love and praise it gets. It is a piece of art. This book follows Evelyn Hugo, one of the biggest actresses from the 1950's forward. She is stunning and confident and notably known for having been married 7 times to 7 different men. Monique Grant, a journalist, has been handpicked by Evelyn herself to write her biography, for reasons she doesn't know yet. Evelyn, at the age of 79, is finally ready to tell her story, but only if it is Monique writing it.Evelyn's story was so interesting and attention grabbing. Following her throughout her life, reading about all her ups and downs and her relationships, how she got where she is now, it was all so well crafted. Taylor Jenkins Reid knows how to write, that's for sure. I loved Evelyn as a character. Not because she is a picture perfect good person, but because she is flawed. She is cunning, charismatic, determined, and not so selfless for the most part. And that makes it so easy to root for her. You want her to win. You can't help but love Evelyn Hugo and become invested in her life. She and all the other characters just felt so human. I also thought it did an amazing job with dealing with Evelyn's struggles and showing what she had to go through and had to sacrifice in her life. Additionally with portraying the people that tried to tear her down or dismissed her for who she is. Evelyn has overcome so many obstacles that were thrown her way and I loved seeing her coming to terms with who she is and how she was always completely and unabashedly herself.I would say that one of my favorite aspect ​of this entire book was the character dynamics. Her relationship with Celia was a testament to her growth. Her relationship with her daughter Conner was so heartfelt. Every single one of her marriages, both good and bad, though mostly bad, were symbolic to her journey. Another thing that stood out to me about Evelyn was though she wished things played out differently in her life or that she would have done things differently, she ultimately does not regret any of it. She does not regret her experiences.But my favorite relationship of Evelyn's was hands down with Harry Cameron. I love Harry as a character, but Harry and Evelyn as a duo are even better. They are platonic soulmates. Kindred Spirits. And anyone who knows me knows how much I love really close platonic friendships in books. Romantic relationships are fun to read about, but a well written platonic relationship is something I value and adore above all else. And that is what Harry and Evelyn had. Harry was Evelyn's one constant in life. The only person who stuck by her and supported her no matter what, even when she was at her lowest. And that applies vice versa. They both unconditionally love each other and what they have is really something special. Overall, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo did not let me down and I can't recommend it enough. This book was so good that I can't even be mad about the fact that there was no husband killing in it. Buddy read with none other than my fellow Harry Cameron Stan, human!"
2039,3.0,"Buddy read with my lovely friends Ananya, Bhavya, Stuti, Aashi, Bonnie and Aazra.Some marriages aren’t really that great. Some loves aren’t all-encompassing. Sometimes you separate because you weren’t that good together to begin with. Sometimes divorce isn’t an earth-shattering loss. Sometimes it’s just two people waking up out of a fog.Would you desire someone who used her attractiveness and body to achieve her goals? No you won't. You call her a whore. You call her her a slut. Now would you like someone who raped or sexually, mentally abuse a women but infront of someone he becomes the beloved of everyone just because he's handsome? Maybe you would because you can't say anything about the character of a person by looking at his face. But we do judge women automatically by looking at the clothes she wear, the no. of man she dates (or marries).This story is not about the ""seven husbands"" of Evelyn. It's about a motherless girl's journey from rags to riches. She might have used her body to get roles in movies, however it was her talent which made her famous and successful. Her husbands might have been seven in number but she loved only one person. It would look like that she changed her husbands like the same way my mood changes, but I feel that it was her husbands who made her stronger and more bolder. Let's meet her husbands one by one (I might have forgotten their surnames so forgive me). And please don't read further if you don't want the book to be spoiled.1. ERNIE: All I would like to say is: ""Poor Ernie Diaz"". 2. DON ADLER: The worst character in the entire book. “If Don doesn’t want you, he doesn’t want anyone else to have you."" He thought he could destroy Evelyn's career? Ha! The joke's on him.3. MICA: I still don't know if I like him or not. 4.REX: I liked him. He was the third nicest husband iykwim.5. HARRY: To be honest I strongly disliked him in the beginning however my views for him changed as the plot moved on. Guess who cried when he died? T.T6. MAX: I hate him. He only married E. for her beauty and fame and not for her love. Go to hell man :)7. ROBERT: I love him. Yup he was the 2nd best husband.(view spoiler)[8. CELIA: I didn't like her very much due to some reasons I've written below (hide spoiler)]I previously rated it 4 stars but after reading Malibh Rising I don't think this book deserves 4 stars. REASON 1: I didn't like how this book portrayed men. Look I'm a big proponent of feminism, but I despise it when males are portrayed as the worst creatures on the planet. I want women to be treated equally to men, but it does not necessitate portraying males as inferior to women. Consider the disparity that will exist between us, the women who are striving for fair treatment, and them. Gay males were the only ones who didn't want to get inside Evelyn's pants. This was what I felt while reading the book.I don’t think she liked me working with my ex-husband every day. I don’t think she liked me working with Max Girard every day. I don’t think she liked my long hours. And I got the impression that while she loved my baby girl, babysitting wasn’t exactly her idea of a good time.REASON 2: Celia was never one of my favourites. She was too self-conscious about Evelyn's feelings for her. She needed to be told that she was loved all of the time. She grew excessively envious of any man who came into contact with E. For the love of God, she became envious of a gay man. She also didn't treat E. with the respect she deserved. E. wanted to protect them both from the media, which could ruin their lives, so she called her a whore. She never tried to see things from E.'s point of view.I'm at a loss for words when it comes to Monique. We didn't got to spend much time with her. I wanted a little more from her point of view.Finally I would like to say is that I love Evelyn. You can't even try to hate her. I cried at the end (Which isn't something very new because I usually cry after completing every emotional book).""I hate Evelyn, but I think I like her very much. I wish she had never existed, and yet I can’t help but admire her a great deal."""
2040,5.0,"This is not only one of my favorite books of this year, but one of my favorite books I've ever read in my entire life. "
2041,5.0,"This was phenomenal. So honest and raw, I just loved it."
2042,5.0,"For a person who is passionate enough to achieve their goals,this book served as a page turner for me. Once I started it, just couldn't put it down until the end. What I learnt is that it's okay to go to any lengths to get what you want. Because otherwise, the regret you would have to live with is gonna be huge on your conscience. Obviously, then being a woman complicates things further. If you really love something/someone, you have to break every rule and go tangent to every circle in order to get it/them. Life is tough on all of us. But love, passion and dreams are something that make it worth living. A good book in my view."
2043,5.0,"I hate this book. I just hate it. It broke my heart and shattered my soul. I haven’t cried reading a book in months and then bawled my eyes out last night. I was gonna be petty and give it 1 star for all the emotional damage but fine let’s be reasonable here😒The writing style, the intricate plot, the unique story telling format.. all of it made this book a page turner. Evelyn didn’t catch a break and neither did I. If you like HEA endings, don’t even bother starting this one🤧 P.S.: I absolutely refuse to believe that Evelyn Hugo or anyone from her story is a fictional character. They’re real to me😩 "
2044,5.0,"This is an gem of a read from Taylor Jenkins Reid and fully deserving of all the plaudits it is receiving. Evelyn Hugo is a woman consumed by ruthless ambition that allowed her to transcend her background from Hell's Kitchen with immigrant Cuban parents and sweep her way into Hollywood, forging a career that saw her rise to unprecedented heights in tinsel town as a unrivalled film star. Becoming a recluse, and now 79 years old, the indomitable, larger than life, Evelyn finally has nothing standing in her way and is now preparing to tell all about her glamorous and scandalous life. For no apparent reason, she has chosen the little known reporter, Monique Grant, on Vivant magazine to interview her. With her life in troubled disarray, Monique intends to grasp this opportunity to further her ambitions, with little awareness of the impact this interview will have on her.We learn of the Hollywood of this era, of Evelyn's seven husbands, the position of women at this time and forbidden love. It is a story of friendship, secrets, lies, abuse, betrayal and sacrifice as the flawed Evelyn pours forth an unapologetic and truthful account of her tumultuous life as a connection develops between her and Monique. Reid does beautiful and mesmerising storytelling with complex, nuanced and multilayered characterisation. This is a must read, an emotionally heart wrenching novel that will not fail to grip the reader. It portrays in detail what it took for a woman to succeed in the Hollywood of this era. Just brilliant! Many thanks to Simon and Schuster for an ARC."
2045,5.0,"5 stars! Edgy. Unique. Shocking. Endearing. Brilliant.This book not only lived up to all the hype, it far exceeded my hopes and expectations. Wow! This was brilliantly stunning!  Monique, a young journalist, is recruited by one of the most famous celebrities, Evelyn Hugo, to do an interview. Monique is overwhelmed by this amazing opportunity. Her initial meeting with Evelyn opens the door to a journey that will forever change her life.  Monique was such a heart-warming character – I adored her! The dynamic between her and Evelyn was excellent, one of my favourite parts of this novel. I absolutely loved the way this story unfolded. We get to experience Monique interviewing Evelyn Hugo and learn about Evelyn’s past through Monique’s eyes. Monique’s perspective added a more personal and emotional touch to the narrative. Evelyn’s character was fantastic - I loved her confidence and ‘take me as I am’ personality!I was hesitant in starting this novel as it was one of my most highly anticipated reads. I always worry that my expectations may be set too high when starting a book with so much hype surrounding it. I was thrilled to find out this far exceeded any expectations I could have set upon it. It easily earned a spot on my Favourites List. It is a MUST READ! This was my first read by this author and I am excited to read more from her.This was a Traveling Friends Read that we all LOVED! "
2046,5.0,"This story is engrossing and incredibly well-written. Each chapter is dedicated to a different husband, almost like a series of individual short stories.Evelyn Hugo's Hollywood career has spanned decades. She's wildly famous, incredibly beautiful, and enormously wealthy. Women want to be her, men want to be with her.Now, in the last chapter of her life, Evelyn's ready to tell her story.... her whole story. She chooses a relatively unknown magazine reporter named Monique Grant to write her biography. Why her?? Any author would have killed for this chance at a guaranteed best-seller.For weeks, Monique visits Evelyn in her impressive Upper East Side home while Evelyn shares all the glamorous and scandalous details of her life... and her seven husbands. Evelyn also promises to finally reveal which love was her true love.All of Evelyn's relationships are so incredibly different because all of the men are so different. Unless you've been tipped off, there's an unexpected twist to this story, two twists actually.This book deals with some extremely important issues within our society today, and it deals with them in a very loving and sensitive manner. This story will stay with you for a very long time."
2047,5.0,"""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" by Taylor Jenkins Reid is so much more than I expected!Can it really be true that Monique Grant, an unknown journalist has been asked by Evelyn Hugo to write her biography? It's an offer Monique doesn't expect and simply can't refuse. It's an offer that will make her famous, rich beyond her dreams!Monique's most poignant question to Evelyn: ""Who was the great love of your life?"". The answer is a bit complicated and Monique will have to wait for the answer. Evelyn has years of delicious stories to tell first! Evelyn begins by telling Monique about her Cuban heritage and poor beginnings in New York City. How she used looking older than she was to her advantage. How becoming a 'blonde', using her breathtaking beauty and shapely figure helped her realize the dream of becoming an actress. Within the glamour of 1950's Hollywood, Evelyn tells of her ambition to become a 'movie star'. She describes the bad movies before the good ones came along, but they did come. She talks about her lasting friendships, her closely held secrets, the details of her seven marriages to her seven husbands, nothing is held back. NOTHING!But, why did Evelyn ask Monique to write her story? Is there a connection between them? Why choose a magazine reporter instead of an author? BTW, why did Evelyn suddenly give up her career in the 1980's?Seven husbands in Hollywood? Doesn't seem far-fetched, right? But, there is so much more to this story than that. There's another layer. A layer I didn't expect, didn't see coming, one that took me totally by surprise!I loved the 'Old Hollywood' flavor in this book created by the author. The scandals, the female versus male mid-century standards that is so full of drama. I just love watching those old movies! Don't you? But what I really loved about this book was that last unexpected twist at the end! Bravo! 4.5 stars rounded up!"
2048,5.0,"Oh, this addictive novel made my queer boy heart sing. In The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, we follow Monique Grant, a writer struggling to launch her career. As part of her job at the magazine she works at, she gets called on to do a cover story about Evelyn Hugo, a famous actress who had seven husbands. Evelyn has a surprise for Monique: instead of giving her enough material for one article, she wants to give her her whole life story, so that Monique can write her biography. This opportunity serves as a huge boon for Monique, the chance to write a biography that will make her millions of dollars. But, as Monique peels back the layers of Evelyn's life - her ambitious climb to the top as a Cuban woman, the seven husbands she married and left, and a grand, gay secret - she learns that her story intersects with Evelyn's in a shocking way.Taylor Jenkins Reid's writing drew me into this story and did not let me go. Her prose contains an assertive, effortless, and clear quality that made pages fly by. The style of this novel reminded me a lot of 
Big Little Lies
, in that both of their premises may seem lighthearted and a little inconsequential, but their actual contents are deep and meaningful. Similar to Big Little Lies, this book's plot moves at an energetic, clever pace that had me dying to know what would happen next. The gossip columns interspersed throughout the book added an appropriate glitz and glamour, while conveying how much Hollywood misses when reporting on the lives of its stars.The feminist themes throughout The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo had me cheering and whisper-screaming ""yes queen!"" throughout the whole book. Reid includes so many important ideas in this novel: the sexism women have to overcome to advance in society, the objectification of women's bodies and how women are taught to use their bodies as currency, and the unfair double standards in which women get shamed for their sexuality and their divorces and men walk away scot-free. Reid creates an iconic character with Evelyn Hugo, who feels larger than life in how she narrates her story to Monique . Monique, too, develops throughout the book into a women more confident in her desires and how to pursue them. Just a few feminist lines that stood out to me:""Harry was one of the only men on the lot who didn't stare directly at my chest. It actually bothered me, as if I'd been doing something wrong to not get his attention. It just goes to show that if you tell a woman her only skill is to be desirable, she will believe you.""""'That, in and of itself, is awfully cynical, don't you think? Divorce is loss.'Evelyn shakes her head. 'Heartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.'... When Evelyn says this, I stop my pen in place. I look up at her. And I wonder why I needed Evelyn to tell me that. I wonder why that sort of distinction has never crossed my mind before.""""I was gorgeous, even at fourteen. Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn’t know her power, but I’m sick of all that. I turned heads.""The book's incorporation of queer sexuality and homophobia also had me walking side to side. Evelyn's relationships with Celia had me fanboying so hard from the very start. I felt so much vicarious joy and angst from their relationship. Reid writes their dialogue in such an electric, snappy, and enticing way. Similar to another one of my favorite 2018 reads, 
The Heart's Invisible Furies
, Reid shows how homophobia literally damaged and destroyed queer people's relationships and forced them into hiding. Just like John Boyne, Reid compels us to care about one of the main characters of this book, Evelyn Hugo, so our hearts break alongside hers when things get rough with Celia. Reid also addresses bisexuality and biphobia with sensitivity in this book, so hats off to her.Overall, an excellent read I would recommend to fans of fiction, especially fast-paced fiction with strong, complex women and queer characters as well. This novel took me by surprise and I hope it can touch other people's hearts as much as it touched mine. Now I have to check out Reid's other books because this one just blew me away."
2049,2.0," My thoughts in a nutshell Wow, this was a huge disappointment. I truly love Taylor Jankins Reid. I enjoy her writing style and her characters. I already read 3 books by her and all of them got 5 stars from me. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the highest rated book and everyone seems to love it. So I have a pretty high expectation. It is just not for me. I can understand why people loved it. I get it why it ended up being everyone's favorite.Nah, I'm the total opposite of everyone and I'm a picky bitch. :DI didn't feel any connection to everyone. You know what? I say it out loud. I HATE Evelyn. I think she is a horrible person. She is just a disgusting little bitch who wants only money and fame. She always makes the wrong decision, and then she becomes hysterical about it. WTF EVELYN.The ending was weak. I was so happy that I was capable of finishing it. I seriously wanted to DNF it.I'm so angry. I'm not too fond of this storyline but it was some good section. I think the writing style was great but sometimes I got bored because of the repetitive part. Though the audiobook version was amazing, I highly recommend listening to it if you decide to pick this up.I gave it 2 stars. I don't want to see this book again in my life. Nevertheless, I will read TJR's other books in the future."

Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestThis is the second over-hyped book I've picked up this month that actually pleasantly surprised me (the first one was Holly Black's THE CRUEL PRINCE, if you're curious). I'd actually been avoiding THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO, because it sounded like more of that gently-padded historical fiction I can't stand, where the past ties into the present of some plucky, Pinterest-and-yoga type, who has her uncertain future resolved by some personal revelation of the past (I am looking at you, SECRET HISTORY OF THE PINK CARNATION). It was only when I saw reviews suggesting that the subject matter contained herein might be darker, and weightier, than I thought, that I decided to bite the bullet and dive in.My goodness, but this book was not only amazing - it turned out to be just the thing I needed right now. Readable. Suspenseful. A little light, yes, but in no way padded or fluffy. Beneath that attractive cover is a core of jabby metal spikes, and you can say the same of the titular heroine, Evelyn Hugo, who's a cross between Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe (with a dash of Merle Oberon), with all the cunning of a Machiavellian prince. This is a woman who knows exactly what she wants, and will do anything to get it - and succeeds. The narrator is a multiracial woman named Monique, who works for a Vogue-like magazine called Vivant. Monique is just a mid-level reporter, very low on the food-chain, and she's feeling depressed because her husband tried to force her to choose between him and her career - and she's having second guesses about the choice she made and the effects that it will have on her life. Nobody is more surprised than Monique when her editor grumpily tells her that she, and she alone, has been offered the rare opportunity for an exclusive interview with the now-reclusive actress. Even more shocking still - when Monique and Evelyn finally meet, Evelyn tells her that the interview was just a ruse: Evelyn doesn't want an op-ed piece, she wants a retrospective, written in the form of a book, and she wants Monique to publish it, and tell her story in the way that she, Evelyn, intends.There are several ""parts"" to this novel, each divided by husbands. Evelyn's seven husbands each represent a significant milestone in her life, and it was really incredible how the author managed to make them all different, and yet all realistically flawed. Evelyn also talks about the mysterious ""great love of her life"" and the way that her sexuality defined her so much in her youth, and how chasing fame ended up leaving her feeling desolate and lonely at the end of her life. In some ways, TSHOEH reminded me of Jacqueline Susann's VALLEY OF THE DOLLS in how it provides a grim portrait of the way Hollywood chews up young starlets and spits them out, and the very short shelf-life of the attractiveness of women, and how this superficiality rules the people who chase it and abide by it. I was also reminded of this gorgeous Japanese film I love, Millennium Actress (2001), which is about this ordinary but beautiful girl in Japan who becomes a famous and iconic star, and as she makes film after successful film, the scenes from her movies end up serving as mirrors that reflect her pursuit of the one that she imagines that she loves. The actress in Millennium Actress also ends up as a recluse, who ends up telling her story to a low-ranked supporter in an exclusive retrospective about her life.I think what makes TSHOEH really stand out, though, is the seriousness of the content. Sexism in the film industry, and institutionalized sexism, sure. But then there's also the topics of assisted suicide, domestic violence (and the trap of normalizing this abuse while living in this situation), racism, internalized racism, and sexuality. The Stonewall riots are mentioned, and the erasure of bisexuality actually plays a pretty huge role in the story. This is one of the few books I've read that really goes into what it's like being bi, and portrays relationships with people of both genders. I also really liked how Monique was half-black and Evelyn was Cuban-American, and how their cultures shaped them.THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO is a really good book. The pacing is really well done, and like Monique, I found that this Interview with the Vampire-style format kept me coming back for more, because with every question answered, another immediately popped up in its place. Reading this is like reading one of those mildly trashy grand epics of the 70s and 80s that follow one character throughout their life, chronicling their loves, their hubris, and their sorrows. It was a fun, solid read with good characters, and a darned good (if bittersweet) story. You should read it!4.5 stars"
2051,5.0,"Well, color me shocked I actually really enjoyed this super hyped up book! It’s taken me all evening to decide on my rating but genuinely I can’t find anything I’d really change about this. A lovely & tragic story about discovering what & who are truly important. Would recommend the audio book! "
2052,5.0,"Two things you should know about me before we get into this review: 1. I don’t cry when I read. Sometimes a book would have some emotional effect on me but never to the extent of tears. 2. I don’t care for the ’50s nor do I care about Hollywood actresses. This is all to say I loved this book and did in fact cry while reading this book. 5 times in total and I can imagine myself bawling in class for the next week thinking about Evelyn. The seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo follows Monique, a writer turned journalist, who is given the bizarre opportunity to interview Evelyn Hugo, an old Hollywood icon. Through Evelyn's reminiscent storytelling we learn the ups and downs of her life and of course, her seven husbands. This book was truly amazing. Learning about Evelyns life turned me into a tiny ball of emotions. The story - There’s truly something about knowing so much about Evelyns life before actually- learning about Evelyn's life that makes this story as beautiful as it is. We knew how her story would end right at the start, it was a matter of connecting the dots from there. Something about this abstract mode of storytelling had me hooked from the very beginning. Everlyn and Celia; I want what they have. They work so well together in an odd yet cohesive manner. I Ship!! 🥺Though I would die for Evelyn and Celias’ relationship, I wasn’t head over heels for Celia herself. To put it simply, she was selfish. This is obviously up for interpretation but I believe Celia didn’t have it in her to see the bigger picture. Every stump in the metaphorical road that was Evelyn and Celias relationship, Celia thought would end their relationship. Whereas on the flip side, Evelyn isn’t as selfish as everyone believes her to be. She valued her relationship with Celia and valued a lot of other things as well. These values were ultimately her demise time and time again in their relationship. If there was anything I learnt from this story, it was this: life is too short to be worrying about others opinions. Live your life, love who you want and don’t be ashamed of who you are. 💓I didn’t use my usual rating rubric because this is easily a 5-star read 🌟 ~~~I’m at a loss for words... this was grandeur. Review to come tomorrow. Tonight, I cry 🥲"

2054,5.0,"________________________This is going to come as a shock to some and definitely a shock to me but...I LOVED THIS FUCKING BOOK!!! I mean, not just loved but LOVED LOVED. Like passionately loved. Like held it to my chest and caressed it like a lover loved... ok things are getting weird here... but you get my meaning. I loved Evelyn. Like LOVED LOVED. She is one of the most fascinating characters I have ever read. I simply could not get enough of her and luckily Taylor Jenkins Reid was astute enough to write the majority of this book in her voice.I thought I knew just from reading the description why Evelyn chose Monique to write her biography, it seemed so obvious. Holy hell was I ever wrong. I felt like I had been physically slapped in the face when the truth was revealed. This book is exquisite.It is without flaw.It is worthy of all the praise.________________________** I read this book because, luckily, it was on sale and I was stupid enough to not request it on NetGalley. All opinions are my own. **"
2055,5.0,"Ok, pero díganle a mi cerebro que Evelyn Hugo es alguien ficticio, y que nunca llegaré a ver una de sus películas. Esta mujer es lo máximo ❤ Ahora que pasó una semana desde que lo termine (Tan vacía quedé ahre) pienso que si este libro lo mandan a leer en la escuela el mundo seria un mejor lugar, por todos los temas que trata y que la generación actual (o gran parte de ella) esta luchando para que sean aceptados y respetados. Definitivamente es un 5/5 para mí, este libro es una joya, como dicen en todos lados ¡VAYAN A LEERLO PERO YA!!!"
2056,5.0,Worth all the hype 😭💕
2057,3.0,"I shouldn’t have liked this due to the clichéd writing, hackneyed plot and transparent characters. And yet, I enjoyed it because I’m a sucker for Old Hollywood, I like a ballsy female protagonist--one who knows what she wants and goes after it--and I like realistic endings. Wrapped up with pretty bows endings don’t reflect real life and they often irritate me.I found this an easy read after a few emotional books and, since I don’t read gossipy magazines, I felt as if I was taking a walk on the trashy side and I liked it. Three stars for sheer entertainment. Feel free to judge, like the titular protagonist says, “I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.”"
2058,4.0,"Rating 4.5So here is a little secret.....when I travel via plane, I make a b-line to the sundries shops in the airports to read the 'rag' magazines. I will stand in there and read a bunch of them cover to cover. I love it. Something about those juicy stories that you think 'they can't be true, right', something about getting the glimpse of the stars and the outrageous stories, it's a guilty pleasure. Reading this one by Talylor Jenkins Reid, gave me that same wonderful, guilty pleasure feeling. But this one, I enjoyed so much more.This was my first Traveling Sister Group Read and it was so much fun discussing this one with everyone. Here you learn the life story of starlet Evelyn Hugo. From when she was very young living in NYC, to making her move to Hollywood, and through her yes, seven husbands. It was quite the scandalous read. When I saw early review of this one, I was hooked. And that cover...gorgeous. I don't want to say too much other than to read this one. It truly was a great read that kept me enthralled the entire time. I listened while on the exercise bike and just didn't want to get off, I wanted to keep listening. The audio was very good, winning an ear phones award, and the voice of Evelyn just drew me in like she was talking to me. Not normally the type of book I read. But every now and then, you need a juicy story, that almost borders on 'chick lit'. (Is that wrong to say?) So glad I read this one.For a fab review on how all the 'sisters' felt on this one, you can see the entire review by Brenda.

2059,5.0,"“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.” Well this novel was anything but and i'm so pleased i finally got to read it. I knew this book was going to be good, but i didn't realise it would be this good. This book was hyped to the point where I truly hadn't seen a single negative review for it, and given my track record with super hyped books, i was wary to say the least. I needn't have worried as Taylor Jenkins Reid managed to create not only well written, well developed characters but characters that truly feel like real people. It was refreshing to see a character that isn't overwhelmingly ""good"" and is in fact deeply flawed. Evelyn is selfish, cunning and completely unapologetic. She makes questionable decisions and ruthlessly puts everything on the line to get what she wants but she's also fiercely protective of those she loves and is willing to risk it all for them. Evelyn is very reminiscent of the old Hollywood star and you can't help but compare her to legends like Elizabeth Taylor and Greta Garbo. The story read like tell all about 1950's/1960's Hollywood and was shocking and raw in part.The plot kept me engrossed all the way through, the writing was smooth and everything flowed at a really great pace.Monique made for a great narrator and even though its not real i found myself hoping for the best for her future! Learning about Evelyn's life left me eager to get through the story and see where she ends up. I loved that each husband was representative of a different characterisation and i was very interested in reading about how their relationships panned out however the real draw was Celia. Their story is at once uplifting and heart breaking and you can't help but root for them as a couple and empathise with their relationship issues. The ending left me reeling and i am not too ashamed to admit i sobbed. This is one of those books that i'll always recommend to people asking for a good read and one i'll enjoy forever.

2060,5.0,"5 stars! I am hooked on TJR!I was so excited to read this after recently finishing “Daisy Jones & The Six”, and I couldn’t be happier. Once again, I felt like I was watching this fascinating story play out in real time...from the 1960’s to 2017. How does TJR write characters and storylines that seem so real?! Evelyn Hugo, her life, and her career are so believable that I almost want to look her up on IMDB to see if this is really a biography disguised as fiction. After seven husbands, when Evelyn is asked who the love of her life is, you will not be expecting the answer. I knew very little about the plot before diving in, and I found the whole book to be engrossing, powerful, and moving. Like “Daisy...”, this one will stay with me for a long time. TJR is now an auto-read for me."

I was looking for LGBT books because I was doing whatever you want a thon, so I added this book to my June Book of the Month book box. I have to say that I loved this book would be an understatement. The characters are not super lovable, but the story just pulled me into it. The twist at the end I did not see coming, and I cried while reading the last little bit of this book.

2065,3.0,"I've been putting this review off for a few weeks now and I'm still uncertain about how to approach it. Because unlike most people, I did not love this book. Nor did I hate it either, though. My feelings lay somewhere in between and that's a hard place to sit. What's most surprising to me is that there is a TJR book that I'm not head over heels in love with! The story started off intriguing enough...Monique Grant, writer who hasn't quite made a name for herself yet, gains the opportunity of a lifetime when Hollywood icon Evelyn Hugo chooses her to write her biography. Monique having no ties to Evelyn is understandably baffled, why her? Nevertheless, she agrees to do the piece and begins meeting Evelyn each day to hear her story and hopefully learn the reasoning behind Evelyn's choice of author.THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO reads as a narrative of Evelyn's life. At first, I was completely sucked into the glam and glitz of a Hollywood starlet. And like Monique, I couldn't help but wonder why her? I formed my own speculations and let me tell you, each one of them was wrong. All seven husbands held a purpose and in their own way helped Evelyn become the sensation that the world knows her as. There is so much drama, gossip, secrets, and intrigue that it's easy to get swept away and lost inside of it all. Buuuutt...somewhere along the way I stopped caring and dare I say, I was bored? I'm not entirely sure what happened. Maybe there was TOO much drama for me. Maybe it was the fact that there wasn't one single likeable character, aside from Harry, but in the end even he held a secret that I was not 100% okay with. Or possibly this was just bad timing for me. I think this quote just about sums up how I feel about Evelyn ""I hate Evelyn, but I think I like her very much. I wish she had never existed, and yet I can't help but admire her a great deal."" Because you see, Evelyn is NOT a good person. She does questionable things and never once considers or cares if she hurts anyone else. And yet you do understand her reasoning behind everything. You see, very complicated feelings! Either way, TJR's writing is amazing and I love that she took risks and wrote something completely out of her usual zone. This may not be headed to my favorites shelf but I do know that many, many other people will enjoy this book and I recommend it to anyone wanting to read something new and unique.*Thank you to Atria Books and Netgalley for providing me a copy in exchange for an honest review.*"
2066,5.0,"5 starsEvelyn Hugo might be the most real fictional character I’ve ever read about.Now talk about a book that is worth the hype! I’ve been delaying reading this book for so long and I still don’t know why. I guess I was kinda intimidated by Evelyn Hugo and after reading this book I guess I was right to be.”And it will be the tragedy of my life that I cannot love you enough to make you mine. That you cannot be loved enough to be anyone’s.”Evelyn is such a complex intimidating character. She’s such a flawed unlikable person, but for some reason, I couldn’t help but admire her. She was such a powerful unique woman. Was she a good likable person? No. Did I understand and admired her any way? Surprisingly, yes. You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until somewhat stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”This book is a biography of many women and men. It’s a biography of many Hollywood stars. It’s a biography of the people who lived during that time. It covered everything. This might be fiction, but it was a such a realistic reflection of real life. The good, the bad, and the ugly. People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is “You’re safe with me”—that’s intimacy.I loved the writing and the way this book was written. It was flawless. I Loved the story, it touched me in a way I never expected. I loved how I kept reminding myself that Evelyn Hugo is a fictional character because I couldn’t believe that she is. I loved that book, and I’m not sure I’ll be able to stop thinking about. This is such a remarkable book that’s going to be considered a classic one day.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.Song recommendation:Young and beautiful by Lana Del ReyHope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have by Lana Del ReyWish you were here by Pink Floyd505 by Arctic MonkeysBravado by LordeOld money by Lana Del ReyThe show must go on by Queen"
2067,4.0,TAYLOR JENKINS REID I WILL HAVE YOU PAY FOR MY THERAPY. i'm in such emotional distress right now i don't know if i'm a human being or a huge ball of nerves and tears. 
2068,4.0,"I just realized this is by the same person who wrote Daisy Jones & The Six and that makes sense, I was actually reminded of it when reading this one through out. I enjoyed this book a lot especially Evelyn's life story. I just kind of could have done without Monique to be quite honest. Like every time we moved back into the present day I was kind of annoyed and wanted to get back to Evelyn. I don't think the twist itself added much to the story and in comparison to everything else, it felt like I saw it coming and it was sort fo anticlimactic. I really felt the ending was weaker than the rest of the book, but alas that's what I say almost every time I read something. Definitely loved the book overall. "
2069,5.0,"4. 5 starsWho was the Great love of your life?Such a wonderful, mesmerizing read that had a twist at the end that I did not see coming! What can I say, I loved it! An intelligent and engrossing look at fame and at what cost will one pay to achieve it? Evelyn Hugo reminded me of Elizabeth Taylor, and Zsa Zsa Gabor. Old Hollywood glamour. Evelyn Hugo (Evelyn Elena Herrera) is ready and willing to tell her story about her glamorous Hollywood life and various marriages. But there is a catch, as there often is, as she wants Monique Grant, a fairly unknown magazine writer, to tell her story. Why? How does she even know Monique Grant and her writing? The hows and whys don't matter as Monique wants and needs to do this story. Her husband, David has left her and she needs the piece to further her career.Monique sits with Evelyn in her Upper East side apartment while Evelyn tells her how she went from living in Hell's Kitchen to being one of the top paid actresses of her generation. She tells how she loved and lost, how she got to Hollywood, how she married and divorced, and how she rose to fame, how she lived a secret life. Evelyn is smart, witty, and determined. She has lived a full life and has gained a lot of wisdom and success. She is a flawed and like-able character as are most of the other characters in her life.I do not want to give too much of this book away. What I will say is that it is well written and dripping with glamour. This book is so atmospheric and I could see the ladies dressed in their gowns at all the important award shows and after parties. Fame has a price, as they say, and Evelyn pays hers in this book. This is a story of one's woman's rise to fame but it is also a love story. I'm so glad that I read this book - I almost didn't. I have a lot of books I was asked to read for reviews and this one came from the library. I had it sitting on my table and knew it was coming due. I kept looking at it sitting there. I kept wondering..should I read this or not? Do I have time to read this? The answer was ""No"" but I though...maybe. I decided that I would read a few pages, if I liked it, I WOULD finish it, if not back to the library it would go. Needless to say I was hooked. This is my first book by Taylor Jenkins Reid but it will not be my last.See more of my reviews at www.openbookposts.com"
2070,5.0,"How could I not give this one a try?? With its shining 5 star reviews on Goodreads and Amazon, and almost every single one of my friends rating it 5 stars, I had to see what all the fuss was about! I have so many books to read in paper/kindle at the moment, but REALLY wanted to read this one. So I decided to bump it up the list and get it read faster by listening to the audio version. So glad that I did. I think this is the most moving and captivating historical fiction book I have ever had the pleasure to read/listen to! I absolutely adored it!When Monique is contacted to write a biography of the elusive, academy award winning Hollywood icon, Evelyn Hugo - she is shocked! Why has this starlet picked her? She is a seemingly unknown writer. Of course she is excited and jumps at the opportunity, but what scandalous secrets does this iconic celebrity have? Why has she hidden from the public for so long? And why exactly did she choose Monique for this job?Oh my heart!!! What a beautiful story! When I first started reading I assumed it was just going to be a story about seven husbands. And it was, but it was so much more than that. There was so much depth to it. I LOVED the writing! Evelyn gave her secrets away so slowly, and Monique's teasers throughout really made you wonder what on earth was really going on! And although the twist was fairly obvious, or at least partially obvious, you still got swept up in the emotion of it. The story was made up of Evelyn and Monique's perspectives and also made up of snippets of newspaper and magazine articles through the decades. It made the whole thing incredibly entertaining and superbly additive! I found it so hard to pause the audio when I had to! The 50's to 80's Hollywood glamour was so fascinating to read about! The drama behind the spotlight is obviously appealing to so many people, and Evelyn's story pulls at the heart strings and does not let go! It didn't go in the direction I was expecting it to go, and I am so glad. Because I was BLOWN AWAY by this book! By the exquisite story. By Evelyn, her life, the romance/s, friendships and anguish she lived through.Would I recommend The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo?Absolutely! Do yourself a favour and read it! *I purchased The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo at my own expense at audible.comFor more reviews check out my BlogFacebookTwitterInstagram"
2071,5.0,"Buscar en Google: ¿cómo seguir viviendo después de leer Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo?No tengo palabras para describir cómo Taylor Jenkins una vez más logró hacerme sentir tan mal por el hecho de no vivir dentro de un libro, por el hecho de que los personajes que ella crea en realidad nunca existieron, por haberme dado una bofetada diciendo que yo soy real pero que ellos solo son de papel y tinta. Ellos son ficticios, sus historias fueron inventadas, pero entonces ¿porqué siento que realmente los conocí? Conozco cada uno de sus secretos, sé cómo caminan, cómo se enfrentarían a cierta situación, cuál es la definición de amor para ellos, quién es su verdadera familia, tengo sus voces presentes, y ¿me dices que todo eso jamás pasó?Aunque esta sensación llega a ser dolorosa, a mí me satisface mucho, porque sé que he leído un buen libro, que sentí que realmente viajaba entre cada letra y no era una espectadora, por momentos era la protagonista, otros era el personaje secundario y en otros era el terciario, pero en todo momento estuve ahí. No estuve leyendo, estuve acompañando a Evelyn Hugo en su vida, conociéndola, ayudándola a ocultar sus secretos, a destapar los demás, a amar, a llorar, a disfrutar, a querer ganar un Oscar.Decir que me gustó es poco."
2072,5.0,"Este libro no merece menos puntuación, sin duda es uno de los mejores libros que he leído y que siempre estará en el Top de la lista. No solo por su protagonista sino también por todo lo que me ha hecho sentir. Creo que la autora ha sabido reflejar muy bien a la actriz de los años 50 de Hollywood, una mujer que salió de la nada para conseguirlo todo. La autora nos presenta una novela sobre una actriz de cine, los riesgos que asumió, todos los amores que tuvo y perdió y su secreto mayor guardado. No esperaba tanto cuando empecé a leer esta novela, me ha fascinado el personaje de Evelyn Hugo creo que es una gran protagonista una mujer con mucha fuerza, y capaz de hacer lo que pocos estamos dispuestos. Además hay un misterio que resolver en cuanto a la protagonista y su relación con Monique. No me olvido de Harry i Celia, unso personajes inolvidables. Sin duda es una novela que nos hace reflexionar sobre el mundo en los años 50, todo lo que sucede a la protagonista, lo que debe hacer para llegar a la fama. Pero también es una novela sobre el amor y la amistad. Trata temas como la violència de genero y la persecución al colectivo LGBT."
2073,2.0,"This book aggressively disappointed me. It was a page-turner, I'll give it that, and I really do appreciate everything it stood for; the concept is great but the prose... yikes. I was told this story when I wanted to see it. Reid relies on cliche phrasing much of the time, uses repetition redundantly, and spells out every moment as if the reader is a pre-teen who has just graduated to full-length novels. The timeline is also messy, making the story confusing and the ""plot twist"" in the end more aggravating and underwhelming than shocking. Also, the addition and emphasis on Monique were simply unneeded and boring. All this to say I was entertained by this book and it did make me cry, so it wasn't all bad. I just wish as a reader my comprehension skills were given more credit."
2074,5.0,"#1 Re-readStill a goddamn masterpiece. I cannot put into words just how much I love this book. I finished it and I want to re-read it again.___________________5 *Goddamn where was this book in my fucking life* stars✨
“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.”
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo isn’t just a book, it’s an experience.So I’m already in pain right now so what better way to make yourself suffer than to write a review where you remember everything of this heartbreaking yet beautiful book. There it is, Taylor Jenkins Reid has done it again showing me that five stars aren’t fucking enough for her books. I’m not sure whether I finished this book or this book finished me.Now let’s talk about the impeccable plot, shall we?“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.”The book is about Evelyn Hugo, an aging Hollywood icon known for her scandalous affairs and her glamorous life. And now she has finally decided to tell the truth of her life and address the rumors when she suddenly appoints Monique Grant to write her biography.Monique is a small writer but this opportunity of a lifetime came knocking at her door which can help jumpstart her career by a great fold. As Monique listens to Evelyn narrate her tragic, beautiful, scandalous life all the way from the beginning when she came to Los Angeles in the 1950s, she feels a deeper connection with the star but as Evelyn’s story comes to the conclusion, it becomes clearer that Monique’s life intersects with Evelyn in a tragic way.Now the characters in this book, the brutally flawed, broken, happy, and sad characters that made this book so iconic and depressing that I can’t seem to be able to forget about them. From the start we know that everyone is going to die as now that everyone is dead, Evelyn is finally telling her story but every single time a person died, I was dumbfounded and felt like a part of my heart had been stripped away because I had already connected with the characters so much that I didn’t want to part ways.""They are just husbands. I am Evelyn Hugo. And anyway, I think once people know the truth, they will be much more interested in my wife.”This book is about Evelyn Hugo and Taylor Jenkins Reid wants you to know that because Evelyn is not a character who can be pushed to the sidelines, wherever she stands she makes her mark thus making herself the most iconic bitch who won’t hesitate in taking whatever she wants. I just love Evelyn a lot. You can’t hate Evelyn, you just can’t even if you wanted to. The way she unconditionally loved Celia and would do anything for her was breathtakingly beautiful“I spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.”Celia St. James was the love of Evelyn’s life. Celia is a complex character even though I truly understand the reasons behind the way she acted like she did, I couldn’t help but be frustrated with her decisions. But real people are flawed and make mistakes which only makes Celia feel like a real person, her pain, her suffering, her love all felt deep and meaningful.“Harry was my greatest friend. He invented me. He was the person who loved me the most unconditionally. The person I loved the most purely, I think. Other than my daughter. But no, he was not the love of my life.“Harry Cameron is one of the characters in this book that you just can’t help but fall in love with. He’s too precious to me and his friendship with Evelyn was one of the greatest things that happened. I truly adored his character and personality, the way he cares about Evelyn, and the people he loves. Harry and Evelyn are platonic soulmates their friendship made me beyond happy and broke me at the same time.Some of the husbands in this book were assholes and I wanted to kill them. The husbands I hated the most were Don Adler, Mick Riva, and Max Girard, others were more or less fine. I don’t have much to say about them other than they are assholes and do not deserve to live.“Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”The writing in this book was absolutely gorgeous. I marvel at how Taylor Jenkins Reid makes her characters feel so real, flawed, broken yet lovable and amazing. I adore her writing, it’s quite atmospheric.“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.”By the end of this book, I felt broken, lost, and empty. It brought out every single emotion in me. I felt a surge of separation as I finished this book. The plot twist at the end yet again destroyed me, I was not ready for the pain this book brought me. I’m in awe of this book. It truly is a masterpiece. With the highly addicting tone of this book to the everlasting impact it holds on you, this book is one to be remembered through the ages._____________________Thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid for breaking me in the most heartwrenching and beautiful way possible. My heart is in pain, the end pages of my copy of this book are wet due to the searing pain this caused me, My heart is so heavy that I can't even think of anything else.Buddy read with Bhavya, Aashi, Ishika, Blobbie, Bonnie and Aazra. 💕______________________This year is Taylor Jenkins Reid's year...I swear almost all my friends here on gr are reading her books AS THEY SHOULD!!!"
2075,5.0,"What an amazing book! This novel tells the story of Evelyn Hugo, a famous Hollywood actress that started her career in the fifties. She's almost 80 years old and wants to have her autobiography written by a relatively-unknown journalist named Monique.  Monique is as astounded as most people are to learn that the highly-successful and reclusive Evelyn Hugo wants her to write the story of Evelyn's life but she agrees and this is the beginning of this remarkable book. The story is told from the points of view of Evelyn and Monique and alternates between the present and the past. The writing is beautiful and Evelyn Hugo is an amazing character, I am so glad I got to spent some time getting to know her. The novel is engaging, complex as well as entertaining. Overall I loved the book and highly recommend it to all."
2076,5.0,"Taylor Jenkins Reid is a Old Hollywood fan. You can tell from reading this book. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is part faux memoir part commentary on what life as a Hollywood actress in the 1950's & 60's was like. Evelyn Hugo is jigsaw puzzle that's pieces are slowly put together as you read it. As a Old Hollywood fan I spent this book trying to figure out which real life actresses Evelyn Hugo was based off of. I have a list but I won't reveal it because two of the actresses would be spoilers. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is elegantly written, rich in detail, just really really good. Evelyn Hugo is carefully crafted and I'm kinda mad she's not real because I think she would be in my top five Old Hollywood actresses. If you live for Hollywood gossip read this book. If you love books written for women by women read this book. If you like beautiful, heartbreaking, and captivating stories read this book. Basically everyone read this book."
2077,5.0,"Re-read: March 2018Sigh... I love this book.Original Review: June 2017This stunning, emotional, spitfire book is about old Hollywood teaching an unsuspecting innocent a thing or two about success in all its forms and doing whatever it takes to get it. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo features alternating timelines as an aging starlet (Evelyn Hugo) participates in a journalism interview of her life story. Lucky for us, her answers take on a life of their own, allowing readers to be sucked back in time to an era of glamour, strategy, and secrecy. Be aware that it's oh so easy to forget this is fiction. It feels like an actual memoir - the execution is flawless...and our fresh-faced journalist is not the only one learning life lessons here. Evelyn's character shares perspectives on equality issues, relationships, the spectrum of sexuality, the cost and consequences of success, and taking ownership of (and responsibility for) one's life. It's also about how times have changed, and although opportunities of significance are becoming more and more accessible to women these days, sometimes we are the ones who continue to stand in our own damned way. “So do yourself a favor and learn to grab life by the balls, dear. Don’t be so tied up in trying to do the right thing when the smart thing is so painfully clear.” It seems we all can learn something from Evelyn Hugo. Check it out!My favorite quote:“People think intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is “You're safe with me” - that's intimacy.”6/15/2017:Can't help myself. I'm reading it again before it goes back to the library <36/14/2017:OMG I adore this book. I knew early on it would be going on my favorite's list. Highly recommend.Full review to come..."
2078,5.0,What a triumph. I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that this will be one of my favourite books of the year. Absolutely breathtaking. 
2079,4.0,"This was as lovely and heartbreaking as nearly everybody says. Absolutely worth reading.I feel like I was the last person on earth who hadn’t read this book and I am so glad I finally did. That said, it took me a while to finish this because there was a bit in the middle that dragged for me – however, man, does Taylor Jenkins Reid ever pull it back together after the 50% mark. From that point onwards, I was so very invested.On the surface, this is the story of Evelyn Hugo’s seven marriages as told to Monique, a rather inexperienced journalist getting the chance of her lifetime to write a memoir to one of Hollywood’s greatest stars. But more than that, this book is the portrait of woman who honestly and gracefully bares her all to the world here. And I adored Evelyn so very much. She is by far my favourite part of this book; she is ruthless and ambitious but unflinchingly honest in her own portrayal. I could not help but root for her as she made her way in the minefield that is Hollywood. Whenever the storyline strayed from her, I was eager to get back to her and get to know her better. Monique on the other hand did not always work for me as the person through whose lens we are getting the story.Told in effortless prose that compelled me to keep reading, Taylor Jenkins Reid tells her story without unnecessary flourish in a way that let her main character shine and her side characters dazzle. I adored Harry beyond measure and thought Celia was wonderfully flawed but incredibly compelling. The ending ripped my heart out but I am so glad to have finally read this.You can find this review and other thoughts on books on my blog.I received a drc courtesy of NetGalley and Simon and Schuster UK in exchange for an honest review."

2082,5.0,"""Evelyn Hugo, el ícono de Hollywood que se ha recluido en su edad madura, decide al fin contar la verdad sobre su vida llena de glamour y de escándalos. Pero cuando elige para ello a Monique Grant, una periodista desconocida, nadie se sorprende más que la misma Monique. ¿Por qué ella? ¿Por qué ahora? Monique no está precisamente en su mejor momento. Su marido la abandonó, y su vida profesional no avanza. Aun ignorando por qué Evelyn la ha elegido para escribir su biografía, Monique está decidida a aprovechar esa oportunidad para dar impulso a su carrera.Convocada al lujoso apartamento de Evelyn, Monique escucha fascinada mientras la actriz le cuenta su historia. Desde su llegada a Los Ángeles en los años 50 hasta su decisión de abandonar su carrera en el espectáculo en los 80 -y, desde luego, los siete maridos que tuvo en ese tiempo- Evelyn narra una historia de ambición implacable, amistad inesperada, y un gran amor prohibido. Monique empieza a sentir una conexión muy real con la actriz legendaria, pero cuando el relato de Evelyn se acerca a su fin, resulta evidente que su vida se cruza con la de Monique de un modo trágico e irreversible.""⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘(spoilers).cuanto tiempo sin hacer reseñas, espero no haber perdido la mano.Lamentablemente la escuela no me ha dejado leer un libro como se debe desde abril, leítan poquitos libros y fueron tan miserables que ni siquiera me acuerdo de la trama.también tengo más de 20 libros sin terminar gracias a un horrible bloqueo lector, enconclusión estoy para atrás con la lectura :(bueno ya basta de hablar de mi y empiezo con la reseña.Lo principal que tengo para decir es que esta es mi segunda lectura de este hermosolibro, cómo entra en la categoría de mis favoritos decidí leerlo otra vez para un trabajode la escuela estoy feliz de haberlo hecho.Hace mucho tiempo que quería hacerle una reseña más completa porque se lo merece,pero tenía miedo porque amo hacer reseñas donde hablo mierda de los libros, pero seme complica cuando tengo que hablar de un libro el cual ame.➳➳➳.empecemos. <3voy a empezar hablando de monique. ella es un personaje que medio igual desde elprincipio, aunque al principio si que no me la banqué por como trataba a evelyn,actuaba de una manera muy brusca. entiendo que estuviera nerviosa pero flaca bajale un toqueun poco a tu mala onda.después se convirtió en un personaje muy meh para mi, cuando hablaba de su vida meaburría, pero si ame el desarrollo de su personaje. pasó de ser una chica que pedía perdón hasta por existir a ser una mujer que le dijo a la mismísima Evelyn Hugo que laodiaba.tengo que decir que monique un terrible gay panic cuando vio a E, monique somostodos.ya desde el principio del libro te atrapa, creo que esto se debe a E. ya que desdepequeña sabía lo que quería y no le importaba que tenía que hacer para conseguirlo,siempre te quedas con las ganas de saber cuál va a hacer su siguiente jugada. es unamujer tan calculadora y paciente. como quisiera ser como ella, pero a mi me davergüenza hasta decirles que no a mis compañeros cuando me piden la tarea.de sus dos primeros matrimonios no tengo para decir mucho y tampoco se lo merecen.lo único que voy a decir es.... DON MORITE HIJO DE PUTA.ya quiero hablar de la relación de Evelyn y Celia, porque es de lo que más tengo parahablar.con el personaje de celia experimente el verdadero “amorodio” a veces llegaba a ser unamujer de lo más insoportable y caprichosa.era una egoísta del orto que solo pensaba en sí misma, con complejo de gabriela de HighSchool Musical. siempre quería pegarle pero quería que este con E, porque ella la quería :(pero también llegue a entenderla, ella es humana y tal vez yo también hubiera tenido susmismas actitudes si estuviera en su situación. nunca voy a bancarme a la celiajoven que se creía el centro del universo, si me gusto la celia de 49 años para arriba, eracalculadora y cautelosa, era casi iguala evelyn.tengo que decir que al principio de su relación no estaban preparadas para estar juntas. tiraron mucho tiempo elcual podrían haber aprovechado para estar juntas. una quería dejarlo todo por la otra y laotra no estaba preparada para dejar ir lo que con tanto esfuerzo había logrado.estuvo super mal que C le exigiera a E que dejara todo cuando no le correspondía. E trabajo mucho para llegar a donde estaba y que C le pidiera eso demostró lo egoísta queera. Entiendo que C estaba cansada de ocultarse y fingir ser buenas amigas, pero no lecorrespondía. E no es egoísta por no querer tirar todo su trabajo a la basura, C es laverdadera cucaracha.odie y ame esta relación desde el inicio hasta al final. cuando C le pregunto a E si estabamal que la quisiera de verdad me rompí.cuando E tuvo que estar con ese pelotudo que era cantante que ni vale nombrarlo la pasetan mal, E la paso tan mal todo por proteger a C. y qué hizo ella? juzgo a E y le dijo ""puta"".entiendo que se sintió traicionada, debe ser horrible enterarse que tu pareja se acostó conotra persona y además quedó embarazada. En esta parte de su relación faltó comunicación,si tal vez E le hubiera explicado a C su plan o aclararlo desde un principio tal vez no sehubieran separado.de todas maneras es difícil ponerse en el lugar de ambas. Mientras leía me sentí unhijo con padres divorciados, por una parte quiero defender a Evelyn a las trompadas y porotro me quiero tomar un vino con celia mientras lloramos y cantamos juntas “traitor” deOlivia Rodrigo.Me encanta opinar sobre las relaciones en los libros, como si fuera una experta enrelaciones, cuando la única relación que tuve fue con mi gato. así que como experta sin experiencia les digo que si hubiera habido mejor comunicación no se hubieran separadocinco años.cuando me refiero que detesto a la C joven es que nunca cambia, siempre pensaba en símisma y hacía sentir mala E siempre. llegó a decirle que solo “era un buen par de tetas”solo porque no la acompañó. pero claro lo justificó diciendo que estaba borracha y se hizo lavíctima.El cuarteto siempre me encantó, era un equipo genial, los cuatro criaban a Connor. perollegó don y su película chota y arruino todo :( aunque la relación de E y C otra vez nofuncionó por la falta de comunicación.John era un personaje secundario básico pero igual me dolió.rex me callo super bien, era super buena onda y su matrimonio fue genial :DLuego vino la decepción viviente, el señor Max Girard.

Ellaestaba muy emocionada por Max y él tenía potencial para ser un buen marido, pero lo desaprovecharon.yo: diciendo que la vuelta de E y C fue forzada.también yo: me emociono porque C mencionó de manera indirecta a E.luego de todo esto llegó toda la parte fea, ya sabía lo que iba a pasar pero igual fue comoun balde de agua fría, siempre conmociona porque es algo inesperado.Harry me vas a doler toda la vida, eras mi personaje favorito, merecias mas :(Evelyn no se casó siete veces, ella se casó ocho veces. es tan triste que nunca pudieronmostrarse , hasta que claro, ambas murieron:(Este libro siempre me da melancolía, a los personajes los vi desde sus inicios y los vi morir.ya al final del libro superan los sesenta años, pero en mi mente seguían siendo jóvenes ymerecían más.C era insoportable pero dolió. Me dolió ver a E sufrir otra vez.C murio y lo unico que penso E fue “no tuvimos suficiente tiempo” la entiendo tanto porque sientoque los años se me pasan volando y no puedo pararlos.tantas cosas que pude haber hecho o haber disfrutado, pero ya no puedo recuperar. Megustaría volver al pasado, aprovechar mejor el tiempo y no arrepentirme ahora.volviendo a la historia quiero hablar de rupert él también fue como john, un personaje básicoque solo completaba el cuadrado de evelyn, celia y harry. pero estoy agradecida con él porquedarse siempre con E y nunca dejarla, hasta que murió.la vida de E fue triste luego de todo, se quedó sin ninguno de sus seres queridos, ella los viomorir a todos.lo del padre de monique fue horrible, pero siento que todos haríamos eso en esa situación.pero me siento mal por monique, deba haber sido horrible enterarse eso después de años.también pobre su madre creía que su esposo era su mitad, cuando él tenía otra mitad.⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘⫘Me costó bastante hacer esta reseña, tardé varias horas en hacerla y poder combinar misnotas, pero se logró. me siento feliz que este libro tenga su reseña.Si bien en mi reseña solo señalo lo que no me gusta es porque mis reseñas se basan eneso. pero el resto del libro lo amo, me atrapó otra vez y sigo flechada por la señora Hugo.un libro de lo más recomendado.esperamos que pueda salir de mi bloqueo.gia. 🦋(ಠ_ಠ)━☆ﾟ.*･｡ﾟ"
2083,4.0,"""CAN YOU COME INTO MY office?""First off, I can't say that I loved this book. I spent a bit of it detesting the main character, especially in the beginning. However, it kept my interest and I warmed up to her eventually. I also liked or loved various other characters. So I'm going to say I really enjoyed it. I even wept towards the end, which is never fun, so poop on you Taylor Jenkins Reid. I call foul. I don't like being a blubbering mess.""I hate Evelyn, but I think I like her very much.""Oh Evelyn. Why'd you have to go and do all those awful things? And why do I kind of like you for it?To be honest I think Evelyn might just be the most complex character I've ever come across in literature. Most characters you either love them or you hate them. No in between, but not Evelyn Hugo.""There's Evelyn Hugo for you. Somewhere in the middle.""As far as the numerous other characters, there was a lot of hit or miss. I either loved them, didn't care, or downright despised them. I liked and disliked Evelyn. Monica was ok, but I never really emotionally connected. I liked Celia most of the time but not when she was being dramatic, mean, or acting all high and mighty. Connor was the same as Monica. I never connected. I loved, loved, loved, Harry. I ended up liking four of the husbands, and despising three of them. To find out which ones are which, you'll just have to read the book ;)Well that about sums it up, because talking about anything in depth would require spoilers and that's just not my style. So I'll end this by saying it's a very entertaining read. If Hollywood life, especially the golden age, or salacious scandals are things you enjoy, then I think you'll love everything about this book.""I don't know when exactly it happens--I suspect I made sense of things when I was dreaming--but when I wake up in the morning, I realize that even though it is too early yet, I will, one day, forgive her."""
2084,4.0,"Me pareció un libro increíble.Cuando llegué a “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” Realmente no sabía qué esperar. En un inicio pensé que bien podría ser un libro de misterio debido a que en las primeras páginas te comentan que todos los esposos ya murieron y no tienes idea de por qué Evelyn eligió a la escritora con la que inicia la historia. Sin embargo, mientras avanza, quedé completamente atrapada por razones diferentes.The Seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo nos narra la historia de Monique, una escritora en sus treintas que está pasando por una ruptura amorosa y una carrera que se encuentra caminando en línea horizontal. De manera sorpresiva, su jefa en la revista en la que trabaja la manda llamar. ¿El motivo? Evelyn Hugo, una actriz icónica desde los 50s, ha decidido darle a la revista una entrevista y, por razones que desconocemos, específicamente pidió que Monique fuera quien se encargue de la entrevista. De no ser Monique, Evelyn simplemente no lo hará. Monique es entonces enviada a la casa de la legendaria Evelyn en la ciudad de Nueva York. Ahí, Evelyn, quien ahora está en una edad bastante avanzada, le revela el verdadero motivo por el cual contactó a la revista: Quiere hacer un libro sobre su vida contando absolutamente todo lo que ocurrió y quiere que Monique sea quien escriba ese libro y se quede con las regalías una vez que Evelyn muera. Así pues, Monique y Evelyn inician este viaje juntas a través de los recuerdos de Evelyn y pasando por los siete matrimonios que marcaron su vida.Si pudiera describirle a alguien el libro lo haría diciendo que es como si Marilyn Monroe hubiera llegado a la vejez y decidiera contar todos los jugosos detalles de su vida en una biografía. Absolutamente todo. Con quién durmió, a quién engañó, con quién consiguió una buena amistad, los mejores y peores momentos, etc.Desde el inicio quedé atrapada con la historia de Evelyn en los 50s y mi interés nunca se perdió a lo largo de toda la historia. El estilo de escritura de la autora es simplemente maravilloso y no gasta tiempo en vueltas y vueltas antes de llegar a lo que quieres. Por el contrario, cada círculo que abría, lo cerraba de manera satisfactoria simplemente par abrir otro más y mantenerme enredada y deseosa de más. Me encariñé bastante con el personaje de Evelyn especialmente porque amé el detalle de hacerla un personaje gris. Ella se considera una mala persona, Monique la considera una buena persona, y creo que como lectora pude percibirla como perfectamente gris. Humana. Ese detalle me encantó, además de que todas sus relaciones y conexiones se sentían bastante reales y nunca encontré un momento en el que me hubiera fastidiado. Siempre quería más.Creo que si hubiera algo que quisiera criticarle a la novela es que tal vez el libro le vino a la autora inicialmente como el título y de ahí comenzó a desarrollar todo. ¿Por qué digo esto? Porque siento que hubieron algunos matrimonios de más en la historia que no me parecían necesarios y que se sentían como puro trámite para completar los siete esposos. Pero esto no hizo que disfrutara menos la novela. Para nada.Leí las últimas páginas de madrugada y créanme que me fui a dormir hecha un mar de llanto jajaLa verdad es que lo disfruté muchísimo. Es un libro muy sólido con una gran historia.¡Tienen que leerlo y decirme qué opinan!"

2086,4.0,"Damn, I had absolutely no idea what this book was about, other than the fact that a women named Evelyn somehow convinced seven different schmucks to marry her. Needless to say, I was completely blown away with the direction the story took and I loved it!✅ EVELYN HUGO was an iconic characters that will never be forgotten. I loved getting an inside view into her mind. She was surprisingly very calculating and knew exactly what she had to do to get to where she wanted to be. She never looked back in shame on her actions, no matter how questionable. Honestly, I respected her choices and I wish I had the confidence to just go for what I want the way she did, with such a blatant disregard for the typical rules of society

""If the definition of enjoying sex means that it was pleasurable, then I've had a lot of sex that I didn't enjoy. But if we're defining it as being happy to have made the trade, then, well, I haven't had much I hated.""

✅ HARRY CAMERON was such an absolute sweetheart 🥰🥺 Harry and Evelyn’s relationship was just so adorable and I’m happy they both had each other to rely on throughout their lives. Everyone deserves a best friend like this ✅ THIS BOOK COVERED SO MANY TOPICS in a very tasteful way. It covered greed, fame, cultural identity, the history of the LGBTQ+ movement, feminism, abuse - and all of it was done so brilliantly and was very believable. I had no idea this book was so heavy on the LGBTQ rep but I love how all different types of sexuality were included in here✅ THE HOLLYWOOD DRAMA was actually very entertaining to me. I really enjoyed all of the random conflicts Evelyn was thrown into and how she always managed to scheme her way back into the spotlight... oftentimes through some creative marriages 😅 Makes you wonder how much of the real Hollywood is just smoke and mirrors tooOverall, I am really happy I finally got to read this book! I've had it on hold at my library for close to a year now and it was definitely worth the wait. While I think it was incredibly well written and that the characters were amazing, there was something about the last quarter of the book that felt a little anticlimactic. But I definitely still recommend it to everyone!"

“Seven husbands. Which one did she love best? Which one was the real one?”
I’m a huge fan of Taylor Jenkins Reid books and in this novel she presents the life story of an Hollywood icon who seems to have randomly picked our heroine to write this priceless piece. The story is not what I expected yet was executed and delivered expertly and left me in awe of Miss Reid’s talent. 
“I will tell you my life story in a way that will be beneficial to both us. Although, to be honest, mainly you.”
The now aged icon starts at the beginning of her life and leads a reader and our writer, Monique through the story of her scandalous life. Evelyn is a beauty being the envy of men and woman alike. She light up the stage, her sex appeal, her talent, her strength, and let’s not forget seven failed marriages.“I’ve spent a very long time learning how to spin the truth. It’s hard to undo that wiring.” Evelyn does harbor a secret that she has kept out of the papers and in which makes this story a bit scandalous yet in the end beautiful. I devoured the story, I loved how the author even tied in Monique to the plot and in the end the last line will stay with me for a very long time!!! "
2088,5.0,"4.5 StarsTraveling Sisters Group Read Review by Brenda, Norma, Holly, PorshaJo, Jennifer and Linda (sisters mom)The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a unique, delicious, fun, steamy, and stunning story that reads like a tell-all memoir with rich and scandalous content that had us all flipping those pages as fast as we could. Not one of those pages were boring! Taylor Jenkins Reid does a fantastic job creating and bringing together realistic, rich, diverse and well-developed characters to life that we all quickly loved and adored. Even some of the not well-loved characters brought some kind of lesson, insight, and wisdom into the story through all of the topics and situations that incurred throughout Evelyn’s life. Taylor Jenkins Reid uniquely leads us through Evelyn’s life as she relays her life story to writer Monique which is told to us in husband sections. Through Evelyn’s telling we learn about Evelyn’s life that she shared with her seven husbands and we could see and feel her struggles, and how calculated yet graceful she was to keep herself in the limelight. We admired her determination and strength. Taylor Jenkins Reid does a great job weaving in so many different scenarios and topics within the storyline. We loved how we could see how vulnerable she was and how she refused to let that stop her to get what she wanted. We all really enjoyed all the stories and each section of the husbands and their title and found them fitting to each husband. It was a very clever and unique way to introduce us to each husband. The husband and story we all loved the most of Evelyn’s was Brilliant, Kind-hearted, Tortured Harry Cameron. Their relationship sparked the most emotion in us and we really enjoyed their very special relationship. Taylor Jenkins Reid does such an excellent job with each of the husbands stories and we could really see how much Evelyn grows and learns something about herself through each of her husband's and the relationship she had with them.We all really enjoyed the tabloid articles that were weaved into the story adding a sensational feel to this story for us. Taylor Jenkins Reid does a brilliant job of making Evelyn so real by deriving insight from her, giving her many words of wisdom. Throughout our discussion, we really enjoyed sharing her words of wisdom that we thought highlighted her story even more as we were reading. We really enjoyed her insight and wisdom that she brought to her own story. So we can’t leave this review without sharing one. “The world doesn’t give things, you take things.”The ending left a few of us teary-eyed and caught us all off guard as we never saw it coming. At times it felt a little over the top but it really worked for us and in the end, it left us wondering how many relationships, similar scenarios, and cover-ups really do happen in Hollywood. It had us thinking and picturing different actresses and discussing who we felt was similar to Evelyn and who she reminded of us and would go to the lengths that Evelyn did to stay in the limelight.All of our Traveling Sisters Group Read Reviews can be found on Norma’s and my sister blog:http://www.twogirlslostinacouleereadi..."
2089,5.0,"After plowing my way through the Daisy Jones and the Six, I was excited to learn that Tara Jenkins Reid has written other books, and that somehow I’ve just been living under a rock (figuratively) and just completely missed this book (literally). Like Daisy Jones, Evelyn Hugo is a powerfully- written, captivating, and memorable female lead. This book spans several decades, and its backdrop is the Hollywood film industry (and if there is anything I love besides books and music, it’s movies) so I was here just for that whole movie industry thing, just like I was there listening to Daisy Jones for the whole music industry thing. Yes, there is a lot of Hollywood. Yes, there are (literally) seven husbands that each get their fifteen minutes of fame here. But, holy guacamole, so much more is packed into these pages that I was not expecting at all, and I really don’t want to tell you what other themes are in here. I don’t really want to tell you what directions this story goes. I really just want you to pick it up, knowing it’s written by a very capable author, and just roll with it. Don’t overthink it. Don’t try to get ahead of it. Just turn the pages (after reading the words on said pages first, obviously). Man, this plot is just expertly pieced together, in my opinion. There are two different timelines, and they both unfold into a very dramatic, unsettling, jaw-dropping ending. One of the greatest things reading can do is make us more empathetic and understanding. This one, while absolutely just an entertaining book to kick back and read, also challenged me. It grabbed my hand and pulled me into a different world that, while fictional, felt all too real. Reid provided me with a reading experience I will not be forgetting anytime soon. Her characters were all full of life and jumped off the page. I sometimes found myself out there in California, or New York, or France, or Spain, or wherever the story went. I was lost in the setting, stumbling around trying to find my own agent, trying to land my own small part in a commercial or something. I really didn’t expect to love this book as much as I did, but it exceeded my expectations. It is a beautifully-written novel that was more than simply a great fiction novel. It pushed me outside of my box (figuratively) and forced itself deep into my brain so that the story and the emotions it packed with it will stick around for a while (literally)."

When you write the ending, Monique, make sure it’s clear that I don’t love this apartment, that I don’t care about all my money, that I couldn’t give a rat’s ass if people think I’m a legend, that the adoration of millions of people never warmed my bed.When you write the ending, Monique, tell everyone that it is the people I miss. Tell everyone that I got it wrong. That I chose the wrong things most of the time.When you write the ending, Monique, make sure the reader understands that all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure it’s clear that I found it.


I'm sorry in advance if this review will come out more like a love-sick goodbye letter than an actual analysis of what the book was like but...Lord, this freaking book should come with a warning. Read responsibly and parsimoniously. Might cause death by heartbreak in a thousand different ways.The Song of Achilles is comedy compared to this book.I've never cried this much over a novel and I'm sure The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo will stay in my heart forever as one of those books I wish I could reread for the first time again and again. It was not just a book, but a transcendent experience and a very painful and emotional journey. Reid's writing is egregious, raw, it hits straight to the deepest corners of the soul (although her view of bi people is a bit blurred on the edges). Evelyn's character is iconic in its unrelatable-ness, realistically flawed, the grayest main character you'll ever find outside of a fantasy novel. I loved the setting the author created infinitely as I did the lgbt+ representation. I can see why people might argue bisexuals were shown once and again like they can't just keep it in their pants, but I read Evelyn's sleeping around purely as an Evelyn thing rather than it being tied to her sexuality, because it was clear she did what she did because she wanted to and not because she felt like she needed to because of some sort of internalized biphobia. (view spoiler)[ On the other hand, can we please stop with the bury your gays trope? 😭 (hide spoiler)]) The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is one of those novels that has the power of duality. It's a great work of fiction that tells a story to enjoy in your free time and at the same time it's a message that everybody should hear about. It's a book that makes you feel whole and shattered at the same time. It's a book that loves its reader but never expects the same courtesy. A love story that transcends time, space, paper and flesh. A real tour de force full of joy, friendship, success, guilt, forgiveness, grief, and most importantly, love in all its forms."
2091,5.0,"5 luminous stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐!
A bold and spectacular work of fiction - honest to the point of excruciating brutality - that leaves nothing unsaid, and says what we wouldn't have otherwise known needed telling. In the name of what we value in literature, it must be said in turn that this book needed writing, therefore literature needed Taylor Jenkins Reid's storytelling.
🌹🌹🌹With Evelyn Hugo, Taylor Jenkins Reid delves into and unveils human complexities that challenge and surpass the very notion of bestseller. By means of a protagonist – Evelyn – so wholly developed and elected as the representative of truth within the novel, the author constructs a story-within-a-story of Evelyn's unfolding biography as it is related first-hand to the chosen editor and writer, Monique Grant, whose own story is scattered in snippets in those brief pauses in Evelyn's narrative. Its ambiguous moral significance – or lack thereof – lies in the multifaceted sense of self and prevailing dignity by way of which Evelyn ""wants to be seen exactly as she truly is, with all the nuance and shades of grey"": the precise and gruesome detailing of her rise to glory, her daring and vaulting ambition in demanding that she embodies the number one 60s 'It Girl' at all costs, the objectionable compromises made at the detriment of one's self for her to be able maintain the image of a movie star par excellence desired and admired by all, and also safeguard parts of her self that would otherwise demolish what she worked for so indefatigably: Fame as an escape from Hell's Kitchen.Much like Evelyn Hugo, Jenkins Reid is a master at work who will stop at nothing to reveal truths, who knows enough of the meaning of the word to recognise that there is only one thing for it: one must dare to plunge into a bottomless pit of universal darkness and quintessential ugliness in order for some real illuminating light to seep through. In literature, grasping at the Truth owes much to structural coherence and orchestration, and TJR leaves nothing to be desired on this account. The Truth, semi-truths, ironic truths, undeliberate truths, untruths, outright lies, make up the fabric of Hollywood (""both a place and a feeling"") as the epitome of a tension-ridden and potentially life-shattering juxtaposition between what is real and its triumphing counterpart: appearances, or the idea of what is real. Much of Evelyn's endeavours, struggles and tight spots are resolved with willful dissemination of media-friendly content:""I'm not saying the gossip columnists printed what they knew to be a lie. I'm simply saying they were all too happy to believe the lie I was selling them. And of course, that's the easiest lie to tell, one you know the other person desperately wants to be true.""Indeed, that which allows Hollywood to be acquires a level of Reality in its own right, and the starkness of contrasts between antithetical versions of the Real are manifested more strikingly by means of the scattered excerpts from newspapers like ‘Sub Rosa’, ‘Hollywood Digest’, ‘Photomoment’ and ‘Now This’, that tell of dynamite, sexpot Evelyn and revise her public identity from one article to the other. There lingers the explicit realisation that Evelyn is a product of the culture she subscribes to, and yet she appropriates it to the point of manipulating its mechanisms to her own advantage, not unlike other emerging young actresses. With her precocious understanding of the ways of the world, her experience of the chilling precariousness of fame and the animalistic ferocity in Hollywood's treatment of humanity, she is a step ahead of all others - or one could say that parallel to her ambitions, she finds herself forced to be tragically so, the writer of her own tragedy. There is also the fact that Hollywood is the loneliest of excessively-peopled worlds, with a tricky-to-identify layered patterning of people playing one other and manoeuvring their own success. The body constitutes a central thematic concern, as a measure for the exertion of power and dominance but also as a deliberately exploited means to an end. And yet, the self is left adrift, and when the doors close on this exquisitely rewarding yet incomparably cruel world, themes of sexuality (bi/homo), intimacy and the reality of relationships acquire a resounding weight that threatens to disintegrate even the strong-hearted like Evelyn. One cannot help but sense that the title of the novel acts analogously to the protagonist's misleading dissemination of gossip. Multiple times throughout her narrative, Evelyn lucidly attests to the right of preserving her own self beyond her seven marriages: she is Evelyn Hugo and not one of her husbands has an actual say in that. Though portions of the narrative are assigned to the representation of her husbands according to her adjectival classification of them (of which ""Goddamn Don Adler"", ""Clever Rex North"", ""Brilliant, kind-hearted, tortured Harry Cameron"", ""Disappointing Max Girard""), there is an overarching spirit that transcends this systematic and pragmatic organisation of her story. Symptomatically, there is no such classification for Celia St. James, for she is in each and all, on every page and the very reason behind the greater part of her marriages. The climactic ending frames and partially resolves the narrative; it provides answers to the meaning behind the choice of Monique Grant for the role of writing Evelyn's biography, yet preserves the powerful echoes of the story beyond the written page, the secret struggles and surfacing of love and intimacy in all shapes, forms and manifestations, notwithstanding the inexorability of the World.🌹🌹🌹And thus, between impressively articulate plots and subplots, Taylor Jenkins Reid erects a world that needed erecting, affords a written display to emotions and experiences that demanded exposure, defies standards of storytelling that needed defying. She has authored an astonishing masterpiece that is alternately beautiful and heart-breaking, controversial and relatable, raw and repulsive, glamorous and dismal, riveting and ruthless, harrowingly haunting and human, tragic and tantalisingly real, provocative and legendary. Amidst her pages arises a plethora of intertwined emotions infused with boundless grit; with intransigence and compassion alike. Her writing gives an imposing voice to the devastating loss of self and jeopardised intimacy as inevitable collateral damage of intrigue, social norms, and the philosophy of ‘fair trade’, humouring and honouring the ambivalences inherent in human nature.❤️"
2092,5.0,"  “People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth when you can show yourself to them when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”  Utter brilliance!!! The hype is worth it guys.  One of my Goodreads friends Sakshi Dabhade quoted it as a 'TREASURE',  and I kid you not she is goddamn right!  The only part I regretted is pushing this book away for months and not picking it sooner. I am guilty of judging it by its title. I guess because I thought it to be some fluffy, gossipy romance set in the golden Hollywood era. But this book turned out to be so much more! I found it hard not to think of Evelyn Hugo as a real person while I was reading, it's that good. Evelyn Hugo, you beautiful complex queen! What a wild ride! A very wonderful, mesmerizing, complicated, stunning, beautiful book. Can we take a moment of silence to appreciate the beauty of that absolutely stunning cover?! It’s breathtakingly gorgeous. Oh btw, by that twist at the end, I did not see that coming! Okay, I will stop now. :|  "
2093,5.0,"""Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.""I'm just gonna go and cry in peace. Those last 50? 100? pages broke me. I loved this book so much. I picked it on a whim since I saw the audiobook was available on Scribd and I did not regret that decision. This was a really hyped up book in 2018 (yes, I know I'm 2 years late, wait no, actually 3 years!), but you know the saying, better late than never. Trigger warnings: death, biphobia, homophobia, domestic abuse Monique is really astonished when she is picked by Evelyn Hugo to write her biography. Monique is unknown magazine reporter, no one in journalism so why would Evelyn Hugo choose her to tell her life story? Monique listens to Evelyn as she unfurls her life story - from how she made her way to Los Angelas in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the 1980s, revealing all the truth about her life. Along the way Monique realises that Evelyn's life interstects with her's more than she actually thought in a extremely tragic way. This book was just amazing. It was not a perfect book by any means, but it was just so good. There were so many times when I simply wanted to go on google and search more about Evelyn Hugo since she actually felt like a real celebrity. There were so many times when my brain actually thought Evelyn was a real person and she actually existed. What the hell, how did the author actually manage to do that?! How did Taylor Jenkins Reed made me think Evelyn Hugo was real?! I listen to the audiobook and that was one of the best decisions I made it. It was excellent. I was hooked from the beginning and everytime I was just like one more chapter, just oen more chapter. I ended up wanting to do more homework just so I could listen to the audiobook. I was so engaged and I just couldn't put it down. I ended up just staying in bed and doing nothing else while I listen to the last 2 hours. That something that never happens. I always have to do something while listening to the audibook. I couldn't even change the speed to this audiobook, if I did it felt like I was ruining the experience. The narrator was excellent. I highly recommend listening to the audiobook. It's one of the best audiobooks I have ever listened to. Evelyn Hugo was such an interesting character to read about. She never claims through out the book to be a good person or a saint or anything like that. From the beginning she knows who she is and she knows that she would do anything to get what she wants. I loved seeing her life journey and I absolutely loved seeing what was the deal with those seven husbands. I probably won't remember the name of most of her husbands, but they don't matter. Evelyn was what matter and how she dealt with all those relationships. I loved the other characters in this story too. I didn't really care about Monique that much to be honest. She was interesting and I was very interested in why Evelyn chose her to write her biography, but Monique's storyline wasn't by any means as interesting as Evelyn. And it's not really supposed to be, the interesting thing is actually hwo their lives connect. Celia wasn't really my favorite character. There were times when I really loved her and then where times when I wanted to slap her. I really liked Harry's character though, he was one of my favorite. I don't know for some reason I really liked him. This was an amazing story. I had such a great time listening to Evelyn Hugo's life story and I really need to get a physical copy since thsi was everything I really wanna get to re-read it in the future. If you're one of those people, who like me, are 3 years late and haven't read this book yet. I recommend pick it up. I especially recommend reading it via audibook!"
2094,5.0,"I trusted the hype, and I didn’t regret it. Booktok had me wondering with this book for a long time and I couldn’t get hold of myself and read it to see it for myself. And it was ‘worthy’ as it claimed to be after all.I think this isn’t a foreign book to everyone, but this novel follows the classy, elegant, scandalous, and iconic actress, Evelyn Hugo, as she told her story on how she had risen to high levels of fame in her glamourous days revolving around her seven husbands through a biography to be written by an unrenowned writer, Monique Grant, who also played a big part in the book.Reid’s simple yet addictive and vivid writing left my imagination come to life. She is such a talented writer and she never made the read weary from the first chapter to the last because she never settled for less and whenever a chapter was about to go dull, she finds unique ways to let you flip a page once more while at the same time she assures that you’re still on edge. And it was pretty easy for me to describe this as one of those books that will tear you apart and fix you up in an instant. With a single book, she was able to present both healthy and toxic relationships, and the different kinds of love: obsessive, familial, friendship, playful, enduring, and passionate.I admired Evelyn Hugo’s cunning personality as she navigated her way in a male-dominated society and brought fame to her name. It was the tragic and heartbreaking experiences that shape her as she is and although she was cold and fierce she made me pity her, mad at her, happy for her, and left me soaring with pride because of her, which made me effortlessly connected with her storyline. She never let anyone drag her down nor let herself be labelled and controlled by anyone else. She owned her sexuality especially since lgbtq+ in her period was still emerging from the shadows, not to mention the infamous paparazzis and gossipful tabloids.It made me ponder that everything is temporary so we should live our lives to the fullest extent, and it’s not the beauty, fame, or even money that will resonate with us when we get older, but it’s the moments we cherished the most with our loved ones. It also managed to speak up about gender inequality which gave voice and spotlight to all the women who are underestimated and underrepresented in the industry simply because they are women. It also subtly depicted the struggles of the lgbtq rights movements and campaigns back in the day which resulted to social change. And lastly, it left me to question what was Hollywood still hiding from us, if all of it was still real beneath the surface. It made me realized that most of what we see in films are, if not all, filtered from the truth and that it shapes the way we perceive in today’s society with unrealistic standards of perfection, stereotypes, and negative depiction of indigenous culture.Overall, this was excellent beyond words, so excellent that my standards went high because of this book, and I am eager to read more of Reid’s works in the future. 5 stars without hesitation!"
2095,2.0,"2.5/5 stars Enjoyed the diversity - hated pretty much everything else. I'm going to tell myself that this is the last time I'm reading hyped book that everybody absolutely loved, but we all know it isn't true and I will never learn. ​I bought the book because of the raving reviews and then it just kinda sat on my shelf for a couple of weeks, because I had an inkling that I wasn't going to like it. And look, I was correct. At least I know myself. Main reason for me suspecting from the bat that I won't like this was the setting - I can't think of something I care less about than Hollywood (old Hollywood in this case). That's just not my thing. And while my opinion about the ""stars"" who would do anything (and I mean anything) just to get a little bit of spotlight was already very low, this book lowered it even more. It's been a couple of days since I've read this, so my feelings aren't as angry as they were right after I finished it - so maybe this review won't be a disaster after all. But what used to be a very coherent and informative review in my head is now merely a half remembered ramble. I guess saying that everybody in this book is a horrible human being is a good place to start as any. Except Harry and Monique's mother. Everybody else is honestly barely a human, they are quite the monsters. Starting obviously with Evelyn herself. I'm thinking that the idea of this book was to show that even people like Evelyn are real, raw and as vulnerable as anybody else. I think. Because I did not get that. If I was supposed to feel any pity whatsoever towards her - I didn't. I honestly think that she deserved what came to her.And I love morally grey characters. They are probably the most interesting ones to read and ""dissect"" for me. But, Evelyn is not morally a grey character, in my opinion. Because morally grey characters do wrong things mostly for the very right reasons. Or do good things for wrong reasons - Evelyn did everything in her life for one reason and one reason only (pardon, two reasons haha) - fame and money. Even if she claimed otherwise, it was always about fame and money. It's hard to talk about this book without smiling anything, so !!!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!. !!!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!. !!!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!. Evelyn is very flaky as a character. I don't know if it was done on purpose, or if she just wasn't fully developed as a character. As she is telling her story she makes both statements which contradict one another a 100 percent. Evelyn says that she learned her from mistakes and she knows that she did everything wrong and that she chose all the wrong things to pursue in life, while all she ever wanted was love and family. 30 or so pages down the road Evelyn says that she would do everything she did again exactly the same and that she doesn't regret a single decision. Which is it Evelyn? Did you learn from your mistakes or did you not? It's a yes or no question, Evelyn!​I don't think she learned anything. It is shown through many, many decisions she kept making throughout the book, but it is definitely solidified with her last decision. When Evelyn encountered something she couldn't cheat, something she couldn't sleep her way out of - she decided that she would just rather die than let the world know that breast cancer beat her. ​First of all, how cowardly is that? Second of all, her daughter died from breast cancer - a true and loving mother would never take her own life, but would battle it and live through what her baby lived through, because no pain is too great for a mother that truly loves her daughter. If anything, a true mother would have thought that the experience, no matter how painful it is, would bring her closer to her daughter still. Third, for all her ""caring"" about Grace - did she even think how Grace would take these news?? Grace was sent on a lovely vacation - imagine her coming back and finding that her employed killed herself? Throught out the book it was made clear that Grace cared for Evelyn, so Evelyn's last act wasn't just cowardly and selfish, she managed to hurt another human being in the process yet again. And how maddening was the scene in the hotel? ""... and you knew that he wasn't going to use a condom...."" Evelyn, you are a grown woman, tell a man to get a f-king condom or he can go and blow himself if he doesn't. She thought herself in control of that night, but that detail shows that she really wasn't at all. Sure, you can argue that her plan wouldn't work if she told him to wear a condom, but hey she's an actress she could have simply told him that they are too hot, too young and too famous to have a baby from the first time having sex (he's a grown man he knows how babies are made) and that would have sobered a rock star like him up real quick. I can honestly talk for pages about how much I hated Evelyn, but there would be no point in that really. I can just as well love the book even if it has a horrible, morally corrupted main character (Lying in wait by Liz Nugent is a great example of that, I loved that sick and twisted book so much!), but other things have to work in the book for me. And so far the characters and the setting did not. So let's move onto the plot. It was just okay, I guess. People keep calling the book revolutionary, but I just don't see it. The plot twists were pretty cliche, and not that well executed in general. Especially the scene with the car crash - oh don't get me started on the scene with the car crash. I'm sorry, are police officers on the scene were actually blind puppies?? Because you can't just pull a body out of the car, take it to the hospital and pretend that the other person (you f-king left there to die) was driving, and that the actual driver just died from a heart attack! The driver had cuts all over his face and his neck was bleeding, his blood was all over the car - Evelyn bought the silence of a cabby driver and some nurses, but what about detectives and police? This scene needed way more research done. Also, what was the point of Monique's side plot line? To show that she could walk away from her husband? To show that she can get the job she wants? What was the point of her mother coming to town? I wanted to like Monique but she was so underdeveloped, it wasn't even funny. She was just there, just another captivated audience member to the show that was all about Evelyn. Sure, there was that big twist at the end, which wasn't as shocking as it surely intended to be. Sure, Monique was the one who would ""understand Evelyn's need to take her own life and not interfere"" because, hey, Monique is apparently also a coward). But as a whole, her character was very and sadly bland. ​While I'm on the subject - we lost so many people to suicide in 2018, you'd think that a book wouldn't try and promote the message of ""dying on your own terms"" or whatever, any further. Suicide affects everybody - not just the one who dies, it leaves a plethora of hurt and pain and emotions to the other people. If anything books should be telling the message of ""keep going"" , ""it will get better"" , ""get help"" , ""sure, it hurts, it's painful, but it's how the life is and it's worth it"". You do realize that the book is probably influencing tons of depressed teens and adults who think ""hey, if Evelyn did it maybe should I?"". I wouldn't wish this kind responsibility on my worst enemy. Sure, Evelyn had no family left, but Evelyn is fictional, and the readers are not,. By the way if you are reading this and you are in a bad place emotionally, just remember that you are not alone, you are loved and I am always willing to offer a listening ear and a comforting word. Moving onto the romance - the only real feeling of love I got was for Harry and Evelyn - that was love, everything else was either lust, possession, obsession or the need to control. I felt lust between Evelyn and Celia, I felt great friendship between them, but their love was so toxic, I am hesitant to call it true love, because that's not what true love is or should be. ​Speaking of true love, it seems that the concept is very lost in this book. When Monique's mom describes her love for Monique's father - in the book it's described as soul mate love, as the purest love of all relationships in the book. And it totally ignores the fact that her husband cheated on her? Kept secrets from his so called soul mate, and led a second life with a man. You don't lie to your soul mate - that isn't true love. The only thing that kept me going with this books is how compulsively readable it was - it was definitely a page turner. But mostly because things kept getting stretched out and Evelyn kept hinting at things to keep readers engaged - which is a cheap writing trick, but hey, it worked really well. I honestly couldn't put it down, no matter how mad it made me. ​Speaking of writing - I enjoyed it - it went really well with the tone of the book, and did a great job at describing shocking parts about the ""glamour of Hollywood"" But, to me it held no emotion. People kept promising tears with this book and I didn't even tear up once. I'd call myself a cold hearted bitch, but I cry at videos of puppies eating carrots, so I know it isn't me this time. The way things were written gave away a lot of the things that were going to happen, so when the sad thing happened, I already knew it would and thus had no emotion to show for it any longer. Also, the conversations felt very stiff at some points. Especially when Evelyn was explaining her sexuality to people - what should have came out as a natural conversation felt like a school lesson with Evelyn just drilling the same point over and over again. I think that took away from believability a bit. ​Obviously, from this long and ranty review you can tell that this book did not work out for me. But that's just me. Lots of people loved it. I am okay with being in minority. I'm not here to change people's opinions, I am here to simply state mine. I am also not here to apologize for my, I guess popular opinions, because these are mine. I felt what I felt and I constructively expressed that. My WEBSITEMy INSTAGRAMMy WORDPRESS BLOG"
2096,4.0,"This review and other non-spoilery reviews can be found @The Book PrescriptionActual Rating: 4.5 stars “Don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don’t do that.”🌟 Do not judge a book by its cover.Never have this saying been truer, I had used this saying before when I read books with good covers but were disappointing. This was the total opposite! I never thought that I would like this book, I even hate the cover and did not want to read this in the first place!🌟 My friend Lizzy (A million thanks to you) recommended this to me when I once asked for books with great plots. I haven’t heard of the book at that time but then it started appearing on my news-feed at GR with tons of positive reviews.🌟 I have seen people who hate HP, Six of Crows, A darker shade of magic and any book you can think of. But I swear I haven’t seen a single negative review for this until I went to the book page and meticulously searched for one.🌟 This book lives up to the hype! It was so effing realistic that I thought Evelyn Hugo was a real character, I recommended this to a friend who started it immediately and told me the same thing, he thought she was real and he googled her.🌟 Evelyn will be one of the memorable characters that I read, she is morally gray and she is not perfect. She confess that she did some wrong things but she doesn’t regret them. The seven husbands were also unique and they represent all different kind of men, there was the greedy, the kind, the good and the bad! I can’t go into details as it will sure contain spoilers!🌟 And the writing is so good, this was my first book by Taylor Jenkins Reid but it definitely will not be the last! I can’t wait to read her other books. I highlighted half of the sentences (not really but you do get it).🌟 This book has something for every kind of reader. It has an amazing writing style and characters. It was character driven and I didn’t care if it had a plot twist or not (and it did) because I was so invested in the story.🌟 Summary & Prescription: I recommend this for everyone. “When you’re given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn’t give things, you take things.”"
2097,3.0,I was promised tears and I didn't cry. I don't know what it says about me 🤷‍♀️🤓3⭐⭐⭐
2098,5.0,"Well..I am late to the game again, but I least I finally got there and I see what all the fuss is about. I loved this book! Having read Daisy Jones first, I wasn't sure if this would measure up...oh it did!I think the thing I loved the most about this book, was not even the fantastic story, but how TJR manages to transport you back in time. She has a gift that she can make a character so realistic, that you actually believe they are real. I love that! I will be the first to admit that I did indeed google Daisy Jones...just because I had to make sure. With Evelyn, I already knew she was TJR's creation. If I did not know this, I would have been tempted to google her also.Unfortunately I went into this one knowing a bit about the theme of it. I wished I could have been floored, because I know I would have been. However I did manage to be suprised still by many things. Overall I kept asking myself...why on earth did Evelyn pick Monique? Was it the past articles she has worked on? I couldn't put my finger on it.Evelyn made her empire. She created herself, she did every single thing she could to get to the top. She landed herself in LA in the 1950's and quickly became a sexy, movie star that knew no boundaries. She did WHATEVER and I mean whatever it took to achieve the fame she desired. Good for you Evelyn! However famous Evelyn was, we still see that fame does come with a price. That you trade things in life for your time in the spotlight. I can say no more, because if you have not read it, you need to. Avoid reading in depth reviews because this is one you want to go in as blind as possible.I truly love this author's writing style. She manages to squeeze a tear out of me with every single book. In fact she is guilty of causing me to ugly cry on past occasions. I love when a book can move me that much. TJR you did it again!"
2099,4.0,"“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.” ― Taylor Jenkins Reid, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo🌟3.75/5🌟I have been seeing this novel all over booktube for a long while, and finally decided to pick it up a week ago, this is the first time I read any of Taylor Jenkins Reid's work and i must say that this was absolutely fantastic, never read anything like it before; Glamorous, Emotional, Dramatic, full of forbidden love, scandals and friendships that all came together for the perfect story."
2100,4.0,"This was very close to 5 stars! I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even though biographies (real or fictional) is not something I gravitate towards. I feel this book, if read at a right time, could be one that slightly alters your perspective on life and that's HUGE. It will definitely be one I remember for a while. In short, this is about a famous Hollywood actress who is known for never doing interviews. She then offers our other main character, a starting journalist, an opportunity of a lifetime - to write her biography. Evelyn is a woman known for her 7 husbands, however when asked which one was her true love, an 8th person is the answer. This is a love that was very much forbidden during her career years.This book addresses so many brilliant topic (and does them justice!) such as cultural identity, fame, grief, greed, abuse, society's norms that restrict your life and how it can ruin so many lives without even being aware of it, and so much more.I couldn't put it down, despite the fact that this is not a tale of adventure. It makes sense that I enjoyed it so much as I am a character driven person. But you keep on reading even through the slower bits because you really do want to know why did Evelyn pick our reporter for the story, and oh boy - the twist! There was nothing inherently wrong with the book at all, I think it explored our society and complex emotions really well and in a easy to stomach manner. However the plot can be quite draggy at times and the atmosphere was not the strongest (not that it set out to be so, it's just a category in my rating system). Logic, intrigue and enjoyment were the strongest points to me.Highly recommend you give it a go even if this is something outside of your reading tastes. Maybe even more so!*Slight trigger warning for physical, emotional and sexual abuse"
2101,3.0,"Goodreads Choice award for best Historical Fiction of 2017 An entertaining read of old Hollywood intrigue, sex and glamour. A soap opera gossipy style story with a few twists and turns to keep the reader interested and turning the pages. The book tells the story of a fictional star called Evelyn Hugo who coming towards the end of her eventful life decides to give her final interview to Monique Grant and unknown Journalist. I liked the book and the character of Evelyn whose life was scandalous and full of drama like many of the great names of Hollywoods past. Its a page turner albeit a little predictable in places but overall well written and easy to read. I might have rated it a little higher but felt it dragged towards the middle and became a little bit repetitive but with seven marriages that was to be expected.I listened to this one on audio and the narration was quite well done."
2102,5.0,Phenomenal! Review to come.
2103,5.0,Everyone wasn’t joking when they said that this book will make you cry. Absolutely beautiful and heartwrenching!
2104,5.0,I honestly don't have the words for this book so we will have to settle for this - wow.I will remember this story for the rest of my life. My new favourite.
2105,5.0,"Wow! This book came in and knocked me off my feet. Monique is working for Vivant, a media company, when she is requested to interview Evelyn Hugo, a very famous movie actress, who has refused to give interviews for years. Evelyn starts to reveal her story to Monique, that life isn't perfect, that people are more than just one thing, that relationships are complicated, the power of forgiveness and reinvention, the idea of family, loss, and accepting the choices of others.This book had such depth and tackled so many issues. One of them was the concept of divorce. Growing up in a Baptist church, divorce was viewed as the ultimate sin. As soon as anyone heard that someone was divorced, they had a permanent scarlet letter attached to them. However, as I matured, life isn't nearly as black and white. Do you really know what happened? Did the man beat this woman and then run off with all of the money, just to teach her a lesson? Why does society still think it is OK to stigmatize divorced people?There were a tremendous amounts of very quotable quotes, and this was one of those rare books that you hope never has to end. ""There are people who see a beautiful flower and rush over to pick it.""This book also tackled some of the issues that women face. ""Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn't know her power, but I'm sick of all that."" ""People don't find it very sympathetic or enduring, a woman who puts herself first."" Overall, this is definitely one of the best books that I have ever read. "
2106,5.0,pain that’s all i know.this book is one of the most beautifully written books i’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. it is heartbreakingly beautiful emphasis on the heartbreaking! i had to fight the urge to cry countless times because i was in public reading most of the book and i don’t cry in public fr. but anyways this story… i’m truly speechless like i can’t handle it. this is my first taylor reid jenkins book and idk if i can put myself though another one because i will break5/5 stars (are we surprised here?)update: just sobbed in the bathroom lol
2107,4.0,"Wow. That was a lot 😯.I have yet to read a book by this author that I didn't enjoy. While this one is no exception, it was a bit overwhelming. I think it's what I was expecting though, and why I kept putting it off. A character with seven husbands seemed like quite an undertaking, and now that I've read it still think it was.In this book, TJR created a poignant story about Evelyn Hugo, an iconic Old Hollywood actress. The story was over-the-top, yet believable. Evelyn was a shrewd and unapologetically manipulative woman who always knew how to come out ahead. This is the story about her life. While Evelyn's character was well developed, the other characters weren't. That kept Evelyn at the forefront throughout the story, as the iconic woman she was. "" ... all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure it's clear that I found it. Make sure they know that I am heartbroken without it.""I'm glad I finally read this book. I've been looking forward to reading TJR's latest, but decided to read this one first. One of Evelyn's husbands, Mick Riva, is the father of the four Rivas in Malibu Rising)."
2108,5.0,"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was my first Traveling Sister Read, and I enjoyed the book, and the discussion with the group, immensely! In true Hollywood style, movie starlet Evelyn Hugo was presented to us as glamorous and sultry with an elusive vulnerability, plenty of scandal, and an array of various husbands! Every page brought Evelyn to life, and I was struck by how real she and all the characters were. Because Evelyn was complex and three-dimensional, we had a great discussion about her insight and wisdom shared with us through memorable quotes. One might think, based on the some of the topics, this book would be light or outlandish, but there was depth and several important messages conveyed by Evelyn's journey through her marriages and life in general. I admired Evelyn's strength. While I was frustrated with her at times, she never took the easy path. The acknowledgements section of the book is not to be missed. Taylor Jenkins Reid's words to her mom, husband, and daughter cemented the important messages of this book- grit and determination, acceptance (both inner acceptance and acceptance of others), and true love. Overall, I loved this book. It never went in the direction I thought it would, and it kept me flipping the pages. This was my second TJR book, and I have learned that when she writes on a topic and/or about characters, she brings them to life completely. Every page is important; every word has a purpose. It's a pleasure to read her stories. To see the full review, please visit Brenda's and Norma's blog:https://twogirlslostinacouleereading....Summer 2017 Read #24"
2109,5.0,"I have never been so attached to a fictional character in my life. The plot was so well done and the story so enticing that it took me all of one day to finish this book. I was barely able to talk to anyone today without getting distracted by thoughts about Evelyn and what was going to happen to her. Basically, I ignored everyone today and focused entirely on this amazing book. Every chapter left me wanting to find out more. It was definitely one of the most addictive books I’ve ever read.I especially loved how it adresses important issues such as domestic abuse and homophobia. I feel more informed now that I’ve read it.Despite the fact that this book delivered an inspiring, compelling, beautiful (you name it) story, the writing style was not for me. It was definitely lacking a little something to make it more original.This was an emotional roller coaster and I am SO glad that I read. Thank you booktok for this recommendation :)"
2110,5.0,"For full review, please visit my blog:https://umutreviews.wordpress.com/201...I'm BLOWN AWAY! It was the BEST book I read this year, one of the BEST books I read, ever!This book and I clicked from the first page. It was one of those books I knew I would be thinking for a long time to come. When I was reading it, I was in it completely. When I was not reading it, I was thinking of it. Reid’s writing is exceptional. I think she has great talent, especially in characterisation. At some point, I was convinced Evelyn Hugo was a real person and I wanted to watch her movies. You know how they say for good actors, they get into the role and they act as if they are that person. I think it was very similar with Reid. She got into her own creation of a character, and delivered an amazing story that felt like real! It was so detailed, very well articulated. Both the plot and her character were captivating. So, my writing Oscar definitely goes to her. Another thing that makes the book addictive is, Evelyn Hugo. She is a very enchanting character. Her life is interesting. The way she tells her own story is very captivating. She’s definitely flawed, yet not apologetic. She knows who she is, learned a lot from her rollercoaster life, and has a lot of wisdom that comes with it. I really wish Evelyn Hugo was my friend 🙂There are other elements that make this book very rich. Diversity, sexuality, women at the workplace, LGBTQ rights. Most important of all, none of these feel forced. They were in the story organically, but very powerfully. In my opinion, one of the best examples of these topics brought into a book very naturally. So, another well done!Lastly, the book ends with a plot twist that I didn’t see coming! It was an amazing uplift at the end. It was very emotional & very touching. Taylor Jenkins Reid knows how to start with a high and how to leave you with a high.So, all I can say is if you haven’t read this book, you’re missing out on it every day. It’s that GOOD! I can’t fault it, really. It’s a delight page after page."

2112,5.0,"I'm not crying, you're crying.I just freaking loved this book. I loved the way it was written, I loved the story within the story, I loved the characters, the setting, the glamour... I especially loved Evelyn Hugo.I recently read Daisy Jones and The Six by Taylor Jenkins Reid, and it was just as fantastic. TJR has me as a fan for life. I will read anything she ever writes.I would be ecstatic if someone made this into a movie or show, but honestly, I can't think of an actress that's good enough to portray Evelyn Hugo with the amazingness that TJR has.I cannot recommend this book enough!"
2113,4.0,"Wooooosh!!! That went fast. Such a fun read. It was good getting to know Evelyn Hugo, a star, a bombshell, a lover and a mother.The thing that amazes me about Evelyn was how cut-throat she was. She was truly fixated on what she wanted and THAT was inspiring. She reminded me of Scarlet O' Hara at times. Definitely, this is one of the books that will bring a change of attitude in readers. Anyone who reads this book, is sure to become motivated, stubborn and unstoppable. They are going to get what they want. [ After they finish reading the book :P]Evelyn Hugo, the scandalous star with seven husbands was a gossip stream that never dried up. It was upsetting that her life revolved too much around manipulating what people talked about her. Although, the magazine articles that come in between the chapters were enjoyable. The dramatic events were told in the most juicy way possible. [Extra points]It is an amazing story about a person who craved too much of one thing-- fame. It brought her no good in the end and she regrets it later. It was a sad, sad story. Her entire journey feels sad to read even though she is successful. That is the victory of the book. To have made me feel pity for a ruthless, arrogant person."

2117,5.0,"Glamorous, gritty and spellbindingWe all know, not to believe everything we hear or read about celebrities... Evelyn started her career in the 50’s now she’s 79 years old and wants the world to know her real story. It’s time to tell the truth, she seconders Monique an unknown journalist to do just that … write a biography, tell her story.This book gives us insight to her life, ambitions, friendships, love and scandal. Evelyn peels back the layers of the life she portrayed to the outside world to reveal her real life. It’s about telling the truth, her relationships, the seven husbands and the sacrifices she made to protect the ones she loved. It was heartbreaking, emotive this book captivated me from the very beginning. The writing is so engaging I kept forgetting Evelyn Hugo is a fictional character – I just wanted to watch all her movies. This is an amazing book, not one I will forget anytime soon"
2118,3.0,"2nd read: didn't like it as much this time around. i have grown enough since i first read this to realize that, as engaging as the story is, it also isn't that deep. a lot of the discussions about race and sexuality felt awkward, forced, or blatantly done for the sake of appearing woke. the latter I am specifically referring to how poc/biracial people were handled (it was just bad). and though i enjoyed evelyn's characterization, I really disliked how her relationship with celia was handled- considering how big a role it plays, it shifted a lot of my opinions about this book."

«No hay víctimas ni vencedores. Todos estamos en algún punto entre esos extremos. La gente que se proyecta como una cosa o la otra no solo se engaña a sí misma, sino que además es dolorosamente poco original.»

🎞🎞🎞🎞🎞🎞ㅤA Monique se le acaba de presentar la oportunidad que puede cambiar el rumbo de su carrera: Evelyn Hugo, actriz muy famosa e icono de Hollywood, quiere que ella, y solamente ella, la entreviste. ㅤPero, cuando llega ese momento, se lleva la sorpresa de que Evelyn no quiere hablar sobre lo que se tenía pensado en un principio, sino le propone escribir un libro sobre ella. Un libro escrito por Monique que cuenta la verdadera historia de la vida de Hugo. A lo que ella acepta.ㅤCada día se sienta a grabar y escuchar con atención su historia. No obstante, hay una pregunta que siempre ha estado rondando en su cabeza desde que empezó todo esto: ¿Por qué la eligió precisamente ella, si no es una famosa periodista? Necesita saber el porqué, sin embargo, puede que la respuesta no sea lo que ella espera.🎞🎞🎞🎞🎞🎞Iba a calificarlo con 5 estrellas porque me pareció un buen libro, sin embargo, hubieron pequeñas cosas que no me convencieron. Mi calificación sincera del libro es un 4.5. Eso sí, se va directo a mis favoritos del año.

«Es engañoso e hiriente decir que lo que tengo para contar es un pecado. No me arrepiento de las cosas que hice (al menos, no de las que tú creerías) aunque hayan sido difíciles o puedan parecer repugnantes a la luz del día.»

Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo es un libro con mucho hype y muy buenas calificaciones. En casi todas las redes sociales es recomendada y se ha convertido en el favorito de muchos. Entiendo ese hype y, realmente, creo que se lo merece. ¿Por qué? Por Evelyn Hugo. Les aseguro que es de los personajes más humanos que he leído hasta ahora. Me ha encantado esta mujer.Este es un libro de ficción histórica con una ambientación estupendamente lograda que me ha parecido muy adictiva, no se imaginan cuanto (ya sé que me demore 5 días en terminarlo, pero eso fue porque no tuve mucho tiempo c"":). La historia de Evelyn me ha intrigado desde las primeras páginas. ¿Cómo es posible que haya tenido siete maridos? Pero sobre todo ¿Quién fue el amor de su vida? De siete esposos tiene que ser uno de ellos, ¿verdad? Pues mientras uno lee se da cuenta que la historia no solo gira entorno al drama con siete hombres, va mucho más allá. Hay mucho más en Evelyn, una historia que muchos desconocen.

«Mientras esté inmersa en la historia de Evelyn, no tengo que existir en la mía.»

Evelyn no es perfecta, tiene errores, y eso es lo que la hace humana. Ella reconoce esos errores y es probable que no se arrepienta de ellos. Evelyn es compleja, inteligente y determinada. Haría cualquier cosa por la felicidad de sus seres queridos, si eso implica ensuciarse las manos, lo haría sin pensarlo mucho. Ella sabe que puede impresionar a la gente con su belleza y usa eso a su favor. A veces me desesperaba, pero también la entendía. Al final de la historia no pude evitar admirarla.(fanart de @sunshineart29)He llegado a empatizar con algunos personajes secundarios, pero de mi cabeza no pude sacar a Harry y Celia. Celia tiene un papel muy importante en la vida de Evelyn, lo cuál no me esperaba (bueno, por los spoilers sí me lo esperaba), lo cual disfrute mucho de los momentos que tuvo con Evelyn. Pero, sin dudas, Harry se llevó mi corazón. Ganas me dejó de tener un mejor amigo y confidente como él. Realmente lo amé.Otros personajes como John, Monique, Robert y Connor me parecieron muy buenos y llegué a tomarles aprecio a medida que avanzaba la historia. Al final, todos demuestran ser reales y humanos como Evelyn. Jenkins se lució con sus personajes. 

«Cuando te dan una oportunidad de cambiar tu vida, debes estar dispuesta a hacer lo que sea con tal de lograrlo. El mundo no te da cosas: tú debes tomarlas. Si vas a aprender algo de mí, probablemente debería ser eso.»

Me gusta que la historia haya mostrado de una manera realista como eran vistos los de la comunidad LGBTQ+ en ese entonces, ya que me producía impotencia el saber como muchos se escondían por amar a alguien de su mismo género por miedo al que dirán. Es indignante y te da impotencia, pero es la realidad.Y ni que hablar de la mujer en aquellas épocas. Las situaciones donde Evelyn tuvo que enfrentarse al machismo también me indignaba.Ahora, llegamos al desenlace de esta historia. El final es bastante triste, no me fue inesperado porque ya tenía una idea de lo que sucedería, y si, efectivamente eso sucedió. Aún no sé que pensar del final si les soy sincera. ¿Estuvo mal? ¿Estuvo bien? (En esta parte me refiero al actuar de los personajes). No lo sé. Pero lo único que sé es que recordaré a Evelyn por un buen tiempo. Y, probablemente, relea su historia en un futuro muchas veces.

«Nunca dejes que nadie te haga sentir común y corriente.»

-Evelyn, me alegra haberte conocido. En estos momentos, odio que no seas real porque me has dejado con ganas de ver cada película tuya y admirarte por tu talento como muchos lo hicieron en tu mundo. -Taylor Jenkins Reid, gracias por haber creado a Evelyn Hugo. ✄-------------------------- ➳ Finished: 17/08/2021"
2120,5.0,"I am so enamored and captivated by this book. It was just such an incredible story with complex characters. This is one of the best books I have read. I read about 20% of the book last night and could not wait to finish reading it today. I even went to bed thinking about this dynamic story. It is the story of a magnetic actress in old time Hollywood and her life that includes seven husbands, the controversial (at the time) love of her life, a daughter, a true friend, and a career she had to recreate multiple times in her life. Her struggling as an actress, wife, lover, friend and especially mother was addicting to read about. Not to mention that we get the mystery of why she chose Monique to tell her story. It is just a profound book!My quick and simple overall: get this book now and read it! You will not regret it! I don’t want to give too much away because I want readers to have the riveting reading experience I had."
2121,4.0,okay i previously rated this 4 stars but i’m changing that bc i’m Not A Grinch(2 months later edit) nevermind
2122,5.0,"See this review and more like it on www.bookbastion.netWhen I think back on my reading habits from a year ago and compare them to today, it makes me so glad that I started book blogging. Without this wonderful community of avid readers, I never would have discovered this book. It is far outside what I'd normally pick for myself to read, but finding it was like finding a diamond in the rough, if the rough is the bookstore I was unleashed onto when I committed to buying it. Thanks to a few fellow reviewers I trust completely who were raving about it, I decided to step outside my comfort zone and try a new genre for a change. I'm so glad I did because this was stunning, and Evelyn's story moved me in ways I didn't anticipate it would when I started.I like to think this dichotomy between the cover and the unexpected intricacies of Evelyn's story was a clever deception on the author and publisher's part. Giving this book a title that mirrors tabloid headlines about a Hollywood icon is very in keeping with the way Evelyn is valued by the industry itself. An industry in which her worth is directly correlated to her appearance as Evelyn Hugo, the actress, while disregarding the complexities and intricacies present in Evelyn Herrera, the woman behind the icon. Watching Evelyn's story unfold was the most fun I've had all year. I couldn't put this book down. A reader might think they've got her figured out, and then Taylor Jenkins Reid goes ahead and peels back another layer. Part of me would love to shout from the rooftops some of the spoilers present in this story because I loved them, but I think the journey through to those revelations is too important to spoil. For a story set in the decades between 1950 and the present, the themes and political discourse that is threaded through the narrative are still stark and important. For those of you who seek diversity in your stories, I hope you've got this novel on your radar. Evelyn and Monique are both WOC and there are more diverse characters as well. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master at weaving their experiences as women with thematic elements of love, self-discovery and embracing truths that are not always self-evident into both her lead character's journeys. Their stories are topical, relevant and achingly real. They serve as an especially important reminder for those who might assign value onto women (and celebrity icons) for their appearance and status while failing to recognize the person behind the image - and that we all make flawed choices from time to time.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is brilliant, compelling and a triumph of my reading year thus far. I'm going to keep my eye out for more books by this author in the future.★★★★★ = 5/5 stars"

2124,5.0,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. When I started reading this I had no idea that with each husband, I’d grow ever deeper in love with Evelyn Hugo. This is a closer look at the life behind the glitz and glamour of Old Hollywood, where the cost of fame and fortune may be greater than you expected. It explores the manipulation of people without regrets, the lengths people will go to for fame, and at the heart of it it’s about a great, all consuming love affair. Evelyn is a star. A beautiful, shrewd star. As she tells her life story to Monique, a journalist she’s actively sought out to tell her story to, we see her shed the hidden layers and lies she’s held on to her whole life. What starts as a guarded confession to the great love of her life quickly turns into something far more encompassing, and demonstrates just what sacrifices Evelyn has made to hide her true self, and protect those she loves at all cost. She doesn’t regret, she doesn’t forget, and because of this you may think that Evelyn might be quite emotionless. But she’s far from it. She’s an actress, born to display only what she wants the world to see, yet we see moments of true vulnerability scattered throughout the story. She’s complex and unpredictable, with a strong sense of pride and self. She’s under no illusions that she’s a good person, and that’s what makes her so deliciously intoxicating to read about. She’s the heroine and the villain. I love the way the plot unfolds, told chronologically from the introduction of each new husband, scattered together with the present day and Monique’s story. Both characters bounce off each other well, as Monique struggles to assert herself against Evelyn’s dominant personality at first, before using her as an example to sort out her own life problems. I worked out the link between the two women quite quickly into the establishment of the story, but that didn’t spoil it at all. Far from it, I think the reader is suppose to know the real reason for the meeting between these two women before Monique is told the truth. It adds to the complexity of the characters, and enhances Evelyn’s moral ambiguity. The secondary characters who support Evelyn’s journey are also wonderfully fleshed out, especially Harry and Celia. Without them this story would be missing the heart that it needs as they help to show the softer side of her personality and shape Evelyn into a better person. There are moments of grief, laughter and love between them all that’s beautiful to read. It’s their stories, all woven together at times, that adds such a richness to the story. The husbands all pale into the background by comparison.Highly recommend. This isn’t my normal genre, but I’m so glad I had the opportunity to read this. It’s utterly remarkable, and very well written."
2125,5.0,"I would just like to start off by saying that this book is a masterpiece. it is so well done, so well-written, so thought out.... i don’t even know if i am going to be able to write a review. Because there are no words. I cannot possibly begin to describe in words what this book was; how it made me feel. Before i started it, I wanted to have read it without actually having to read it. I knew it would be good, (after all, it’s insanely hyped,) but I had a feeling i wouldn’t enjoy reading it very much. I thought I would get bored; I thought it might be too dense and confusing for me. How wrong I was. I loved this book every step of the way. Society has so desperately needed a book like this one, and it makes me so very happy that this book exists. Thank you, TJR. THE PLOT/STORYthis book switches between the present and the past. In the present, Evelyn Hugo tells a journalist her life story. In the past, we see her life story for ourselves. The plot of this book is a woman’s life. But it’s also so much more than that. It teaches us about fame, about love, about friendship, about sorrow, about happiness, and above all, about humans. Let me just tell you, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo gets everything right. Everything. It depicts life and love in a way that I have never seen before; it is captivating and stunning. I was never bored during this book, not once. I was enthralled from the very first pages. I feel like every famous person should have a book like this written about them. I would understand them so much more, and I feel like it would help people see that they are humans, too, just like us ordinaries. Even though I have next to nothing in common with Evelyn Hugo, this book still makes me feel understood and seen. that’s how spectacular it is. THE CHARACTERSEvelyn: I am not lying when I say that Evelyn Hugo is one of the most interesting characters I have ever had the pleasure to read about. She has so many layers, so much depth to her, it is truly amazing how the author wrote such a character. I found it so interesting how the person who the media saw and the person who Evelyn actually is are very different. She is ambitious, loving, kind, cruel, talented, and beautiful. Evelyn Hugo is many things, but most of all, she is human.I am honored beyond words to have been given the chance to know her and her story. Harry: to put it simply, I would die for Harry Cameron. not to be dramatic or anything, but I would actually die for him. He was probably my #1 favorite character in the entire book. He was so pure, so sweet, so kind, and yet he too had layers and depth. He too was human, he too battled his own inner demons. He too was very different from who he was and who the media expected him to be. And he was such, such, a good friend to Evelyn. Everybody needs a friend like Harry. He was such a good edition to the book, I cannot even- I won’t ever stop fangirling about him, that much you can be sure of. Celia: While I loved the romance between her and Evelyn, Celia was perhaps the one likeable character who I didn’t like. I liked her in the beginning. I liked her when she was nice, when she was kind, when she and Evelyn were in love and every moment was bliss. So when did I not like her? I didn’t like her when she was angry. you might be thinking, “well of course you didn’t like her when she was angry! Nobody likes anyone when they’re angry!” No. You don’t understand. Celia was a fucking Devil when she was angry. let me explain. ⚠︎︎spoilers below⚠︎︎Sure, it’s normal to say things you don’t mean when you’re upset, but it’s not normal to verbally abuse people because of it. You should not call your lover a whore because she slept with someone else to protect you. You should not tell your girlfriend that she “is nothing but a nice pair of tits” because you have a small disagreement (I don’t remember about what.) *spoilers have ended*These things are not okay, and that is why I hate Celia st James. *ends rant*Monique: ahhh, monique. Was I the only one who felt like Monique didn’t really get much time in the book? Which is weird, considering she was our main character in the present. This makes it hard for me to form any strong opinions on her, but what I got from the book was that she was pretty much just a regular person. Just a girl, living her life like any other, doing her job to make money. I didn’t feel like I really got to know her all that well, but I liked having her there and I wish her the best. THE RELATIONSHIPSI have never seen relationships depicted so well in a story before. it seems as if the author has lived through every kind of relationship ever. I don’t know how she can possibly get everything so on point. There were so many relationships in this book, I don’t think I can possibly name them all. It’s giving me a headache just thinking about it. Seven husbands, one wife, many friendships. It’s a lot. I’ll just mention a few of them, the few that I remember the most.Celia and Evelyn (ofc): I know I said I didn’t like Celia, and that’s true, but I loved the relationship between her and Evelyn. It wasn’t perfect. No, it was very, very flawed. They fought many times, they broke up, but most heartbreaking, they had to hide. they couldn’t show themselves for who they truly were because they were afraid of what people would do, what people would say. It might have been better for them if they (especially Evelyn) hadn’t cared so much about fame. Maybe then they would’ve showed the world who they really were, a lesbian woman and a bisexual woman, madly in love. Maybe then they could’ve been happier, maybe then they could’ve had more time. But I will treasure the time that they did have, because it was beautiful and stunning and incredible. Evelyn and Harry: this is honestly one of the best friendships I have ever read in a book. The way they always support each other, the way they are always there when the other needs them... i love these two so much. They warmed every inch of my icy heart. As they said themselves, I think Evelyn and Harry are soulmates, in a way. I hope they find each other in the afterlife and have the time of their lives.  what a beautiful, precious friendship they had. Evelyn and Don: unlike the other two relationships I’ve mentioned, this was ugly. there was nothing beautiful or wholesome about it. maybe at the very start, but it certainly didn’t stay that way for long. It wasn’t pleasant reading about this relationship, because it was so wrong and disgusting, but it was also complicated and in-depth, and I thought TJR did a spectacular job at portraying this kind of abusive relationship. My heart breaks for Evelyn that she had to go through this, but I also think that it taught her many things and it really helped shape her as a person. THE WRITINGI think you can already guess that the writing in this book was done perfectly. There’s really not much to say other than that. TJR doesn’t seem to have a very specific writing style, but god, it’s so beautiful. beautiful like a-tear-may-have-fallen-out-of-my-eye beautiful. I would give quotes, but I don’t want to give spoilers.... and im also just really lazy. But just know that the writing added to the story so much, it would be nothing without TJR’s touch. I am really looking forward to reading more books by her, actually, since this one was so amazingly done. Kudos kudos kudos kudos take all the awards TJR 🏆🎖🥇🏆 i mean it. WRAP UP:I could tell you to read this book, but I think you can gather that from the review. I could tell you that I enjoyed reading The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, but I think I’ve already said that multiple times. I could tell you that it’s a good book, but that would be a lie. it’s nothing short of spectacular. so yes, please read it. it’s amazing, and our society has needed it so badly for so long. on that note, i will end my review so you can go start this book right now. yes, you."
2126,5.0,"4.5 starsI fell in love instantly with the cover of the hardback edition. When I found out it was a story about an actress during the Old Hollywood era, I knew I had to get my hands on this book as I love that type of stuff. I am so glad to report back this is a book that is worthy of the hype!Aging Hollywood star Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell her life story. But she's only willing to spill her secrets to Monique Grant, a fairly unknown magazine reporter. Monique's husband has just left her and taking on this job opportunity might provide a healthy distraction and potentially be a huge career booster. As she learns more and more about Evelyn, Monique realizes ambition can sometimes come at a cost.This is the type of book that I think everyone might take away something different. Love is certainly a theme of the book whether it be romantic relationships, friendships or even the lengths parents are willing to go to for their child. For me the strength of the book was just Evelyn. The author did an amazing job capturing this complicated woman. I love these types of books that span a person's lifetime and you get to share in pivotal moments in their life, the good and the bad. Showing old Hollywood with the glamour and also the seedy side really added to the story as well.I only have a teeny, tiny criticism and that is I just wish I would have connected more with one of the relationships in Evelyn's life. Other than a few touching moments towards the end, I was disappointed I didn't feel more. I guess that's why even though I did love the book, it didn't quite reach 5 star level. However, this truly is a gem of a book and I don't hesitate in recommending it if you haven't already checked it out!"
2127,5.0,"*****5 STARS*****Full review here. . . https://wp.me/p7ZSCH-4iSEvelyn Hugo is glamor, glamor, glamor. Evelyn Hugo is also complex, complicated, and a master manipulator. She’s a bitch too, which I love. I think her inner bitch spoke to mine, which made me fall in love with her.I knew I was going to like Evelyn Hugo after reading one of her first statements.

“I was gorgeous, even at fourteen. Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn’t know her power, but I’m sick of all that. I turned heads. . .I’m not going to sit here and say, ‘Aw, shuck. People really thought I was pretty?’ like some kind of prig.” – Evelyn Hugo

A woman after my own heart. I just fucking love her.Evelyn is at a point in her life where she is ready to tell her story and she will only do so with one person, Monique. Monique is a journalist in New York with a popular magazine and wants nothing more than to get inside of Evelyn’s head. Both Evelyn and Monique are women of color which adds a deeper level to this book. Taylor Jenkins Reid was able to address racial divides and issues without it overshadowing the story. It was a magnificent addition on her part.This story is told from Monique and Evelyn’s points of view. I really love the way the author interchanged the two women’s voices.If you are like me, the title had me intrigued. Who doesn’t want to hear about a famous movie star with who had seven husbands, marrying seven times and divorced many times – the woman telling it had no problem with divorce, obviously.

“I guess I don’t take divorce as lightly as you.”“If you did, at your age, you’d be a cynic.”“But at your age?”“With my experience? A realist.”“That, in and of itself, is awfully cynical, don’t you thing? Divorce is loss.”“Heartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.” – Monique/Evelyn

At some point in the book, we as readers, have to decide how we feel about Evelyn deep down related to some of the choices she made.

“I’m not a good person, Monique. . . I did a lot of things that hurt a lot of people. . .”“You don’t seem so bad, Evelyn.”“You, of all people, are going to change your mind about that. Very soon.” – Evelyn/Monique

I’m trying to be as spoiler free as possible and so far I’m doing a really good fucking job. All in all, my point is this – GO and READ this damn BOOK! If you don’t end up liking it, I’m about to be like Evelyn and say, ‘I don’t give a fuck’. No, I’m just kidding. I care about you. I do hope you will give this one a try. It’s not your typical romance story, it’s so much more.Let’s get to the important questions. . .Do I recommend this book? Yes, I do.Will I read another book by this author? Fuck, yeah! I wish I would have known about her sooner.
Remember to follow all things messy. . .

2128,1.0,"Well I never thought I'd see the day where I didn't fall in love with a TJR book but here we are. I'm sure I'll be the black sheep on this and I'll never understand why. I hated this book and I say that very, very infrequently. I hated every single character with the exception of maybe one but even he turned out to be a huge disappointment eventually. The plot was both simplistic yet beyond difficult to believe. Contrived and cookie cutter are also words that come to mind and will only make sense if you read it, no spoilers here. One major plot point had me eye rolling so hard I was convinced I would have a stroke. I also really, really, really disliked the main romance. I felt there was a huge double standard in how this relationship was portrayed based on the genders of the characters involved. This ""great love"" was abusive, emotionally draining, and not what love is in my opinion. While I am all for authors branching out and trying new kinds of books, this book just did not work for me in the least."

Pued bien, me pasó lo segundo con éste libro. Un libro comercial totalmente (debí haberlo sospechado cuando vi que muchos booktubers lo tienen como su favorito).Un libro predecible, con frases trilladas, repetitivo...Pero en fin ""mea culpa"" porque la verdad la temática Hollywoodense no me interesa.

“When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things.” 
I’m so sensitive that if someone poked me, I’d cry. Taylor Jenkins Reid, you could've made my life easier. I already have 99 problems and heart failure isn’t going to be one of them. If I somehow end up at the hospital……..you will cover the bill, right? I spent all my life savings on tissue boxes. It’s the least you can do. You owe me. advice to author:  you should get sponsored by a tissue company.  listen guys This book fucked me up so good that I can relate to those people who take 3 years to place an order at a fast food restaurant because they don't know want they want. Well, I don't know what I want to say.  I'm incapable of justifying my emotions. What I do know is that, the editor was totally aware of the pain and suffering I will experience in this book. I bet you on all the grass in this planet that they did some evil laugh and sat back like: I, Tweebs, solemnly swear that it does sucks to be me right now. This book came into my life, messed everything up, and left.  Just freakin left  You ever finish a book and then it's all you ever think about? Okay......idk what kind of question that is.......i know everyone experiences this......i hope you do........i experience this with probably every book i read....probably being the key word.......but the point is that I just couldn't shake this book off. I couldn't stop thinking about it. It blew my freakin mind. I felt so satisfied but yet, unsatisfied. I would literally sit down to drink water and find myself zoning out.......straight back into this world. 
“That’s the part I was stuck in, the part where you accept the apology because it’s easier than addressing the root of the problem.”
 I never understood how I carried on with my life without knowing this gem existed. How could I sleep? How could I eat chocolate chip muffins? How could my family look me in the eye knowing I did, Taylor Jenkins Reid, dirty by ignoring this book. If you're looking at this book right now and wondering if it's only about a lady and 7 dudes...let me list it out for you: ✓ you're so wrong.✓ you're about to get mind fucked in 1000 ways ✓ you're gonna join me in the, ""tears. tears everywhere""  club ✓ YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT Y'ALL ARE ABOUT TO WALK INTO !! That is all. Trust me, I'm your prime example. I played the biggest joke on myself by ignoring this book thinking it was based on that reason.
me discovering how stupid I was 
""stupidity at it's finest"" a novel by TweebsThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, completely took me by surprise. It was authentic, inspiring, and gut-wrenching. This is a goddamn masterpiece and I want the title of the book tattooed on my forehead. I know........the love is that real. Can you see me trying to lure you into the dark side? I need more people understanding how it feels to watch their emotions escalate to a point where you can't put a leash on it and tell it to stop. And there's no stopping it. From one person to another, it might feel like I'm preparing you for the biggest battle of your life but trust me, you would love every single moment. Do you ever just look at a book and know what it's going to do to you. I had the sense it was gonna leave me devastated but i didn't know what level of devastation. Let me tell you as soon as I finished this, I was left laying on the floor surrounded by a puddle of my tears.it's a hard life being a reader. shoutout to those who get me. am i right or am i right?
“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is “You’re safe with me”—that’s intimacy.” 
How could I describe this book to you? Well, the plot will definitely fucking grab you by the hand and show you everything you've never known. I literally died in every page. This is a type of book where you don't want to know too much information about the plot. You'd be on an emotional roller coaster but hey let me tell you..........it's worth it. Also in my opinion, it's 10000 times better to watch the plot unravel and come apart. This book had me flipping through the pages so quick that I nearly gave myself a paper cut...and ain't nobody want to experience that type of pain. Yeah, it was that  powerful, mesmerizing, and unique that it almost had me drawing blood. 
“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.”
It tackles so many tough issues that literally demands to be acknowledged and understood. It's a damn good eye opener. Everything impacted me in some kind of way. I loved how TJR shed a light on these issues and HANDLED IT LIKE A BOSS !! I want to throw this at every single person. So, if a book gets thrown in your face....it wasn't me. but it was me.I had the opportunity to step into someone else's shoes and experience a story that quite literally, fucked me up. Evelyn Hugo is our main character and you know right off the bat that she's not perfect from the beginning. The plot officially begins when Evelyn is ready to confess her hidden story and have the world know who she truly is. She is realistic and very compelling. She is brutally honest and makes mistakes. She will do anything for anyone she loves. Most importantly, 
She is flawed and she knows it. 
 I will not get into the other characters because I rather you read it and discover about them on your own. Or it's the fact that I don't know where to start on my love for certain characters that legit have me debating whether I should send a message to TJR asking her if i somehow wronged her in the past life. Okay, this is completely unrelated but I can't possibly be the only one who believes that these characters are real??? You know this book seriously got under my skin when I ended up on Google searching about these characters and whether they are real.You want to know??? No, they are absolutely not real. And let's discuss TJR's writing style though. Can we get an applause up in here ?? I'm clapping like a damn walrus right now. I'm so giving this the emoji heart eye right now like wowowowow. I have lost the ability to explain myself.
“Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.” 
This is the first book I've ever read by Taylor Jenkins Reid and I'm amazed. I'm not saying that  I'm going to binge read all her books but that's exactly what I'm saying. Am I gonna sign myself up for even more uncontrollable emotions?? Yeah, I really am but sshhhh have some faith in me. I think I can manage. this is all lies I hope y'all get the chance to read this and If you don't pick this up, I will do this to you in a heartbeat :) "
2133,5.0," “Sometimes things happen so quickly you aren’t sure when you even realised they were about to begin.”Every so often a story comes along that you will cherish, that you will re-visit on a regular basis as old friends and you will think of often. For me  The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo  was one of those stories, the last time I felt like that was the Harry Potter Series.  ""You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says ""It's ok, you can fall down. I'll catch you."" I found this book to be one that I couldn’t read through at pace, not because of a lack of interesting story or characters but because I wanted to take the time to let the words wash over me and envelop myself in the world created by Taylor Jenkins Reid, and what a world she created. My heart raced and stopped, at moments it took my breath away and I remembered why I feel in love with reading. When I finally read the last page and closed the book my goosebumps had goosebumps. I had gladly been on the most amazing emotional roller-coaster and I was so happy that I had.I was mesmerized by Evelyn from the first introduction, she always knew when to feed me that little extra bit of information to keep me captivated, desperate to read on but also cautious that I didn’t want the story to end any time soon. Reid perfectly captures the glamour and the seedy underside (at least of what it was like for the women) of old Hollywood in a way that truly transports you to the times and places that she is creating. So much so that when the narrative comes back to Evelyn telling her life story to Monique you, as the reader, feel like you are coming out of a wonderful dream. ""I made it fifty-fifty. Which is about the cruelest thing you can do to someone you love, give them just enough good to make them stick through a hell of a lot of bad.""The framing of the novel through the seven husbands of Evelyn is a wonderful way to move through the years of a long life that doesn’t feel onerous or stale. It worked perfectly that they were framing the story because it meant that that while they were points in the timeline, they were only there as phases of the life of Evelyn, so it never allowed the story to become about the men of her life. And the titles for each phase of her life related to who she was married to were always intriguing and constantly in my head as I tried to figure out how they earnt such introduction. “People are messy, and love can be ugly. I’m inclined to always err on the side of compassion.”(view spoiler)[ I think that the way sexuality is dealt with in this story is beautiful, it is raw, real and passionate and ultimately is a timely reminder that it wasn’t all that long ago that people could be arrested or declared mentally unwell just because of who they loved and/or desired. The fear that people lived with and the bravery that it took for the people who have paved the way for this generation of LGBTQ+ people to do be who they are should never be forgotten (even if that bravery transpired as making enough money to fund the work of the people fighting for LGBTQ+ rights), while acknowledging the struggles that are still ongoing. There are wonderful moments in this book that I felt really got to the heart of what it is to be bisexual and the importance of that story cannot be underestimated. It shows why people should fight to prevent others defining them. So often bisexuality is ignored as its own narrative. “I’m bisexual. Don’t ignore half of me so that you can fit me into a box Monique. Don’t do that.” “I was a lesbian when she loved me and a straight woman when she hated me.” (hide spoiler)] I can honestly say that I have never been as satisfied with the ending of a novel as I was when I finished The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Everything came full circle, it felt true to the characters and honest to the world that had been created, even if at times it broke my heart.Ultimately, this is a phenomenal book that I cannot recommend highly enough, it is definitely up there with Harry Potter as my favorite reads. There are so many words of wisdom (that I really wanted to put in the review but it would have made it far too long!) that I will draw upon through different times in my life. “You wonder what it must be like to be a man, to be so confident that the final say is yours.”"
2134,2.0,"Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Lemme go ahead and gif the ever living shit out of this in order to prove to the trolls immediately that I am stoopid and not worthy of their efforts.So as you can see in the placeholder “review” below, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo has been monumentally well-received by my Goodreads’ friends. And then there’s me . . . . . 

If you know me you’ve probably been just as surprised as I have that 2018 has somehow become my Summer of Chick Lit. I’ve ventured away from the porny and the stabby a tad more than usual and have come to truly enjoy what I have dubbed the “Mom Com.” But Evelyn Hugo??????

It was pretty extra when it came to being chicky. And pleeeeeeeeease for the love of all things that is holy don’t tell me “I read this wrong.” I most certainly did not. I totally got the messages that were being presented about being true to yourself and owning your sexuality and girl power and double standards and whathaveyou. The problem I had?????

Was this book intended for people of my mother/grandmother’s generation? Or does the author truly think we are so stupid that she felt she needed to beat us over the head rather than use any form of subtlety while making her points?Not to mention that Evelyn herself????

I did not enjoy her at all - and please note I'm a girl who can get down with stalkers and serial killers so that's really saying something about her lack of redeeming features.And THEN. Oh lordy be. THEN we not only got presented one “twist” that made me go . . . . 

But also a grand finale . . . . . 

Sorry to all my friends for (once again) being a disappointment to you all. What can I say?????

The saddest thing about this whole experience is I totally returned Maybe In Another Life by this author because my friend’s ratings were so low and got this one instead. I think I made the wrong decision and might have enjoyed the other one. I’ll be putting it back on Mt. TBR Pile.ORIGINAL ""REVIEW:""



"
2135,4.0,"Lights!  Camera!  Action!  Back to the golden days of Hollywood.  The movie stars that seemed larger than life, the power that belonged to the heads of movie studios and how it was wielded.  The deals that were made, and the careers that were squelched.  The absolute importance of appearances.  Behind the scripted lines, beautiful costumes, hair and makeup - what secrets are masked from the adoring public and rabid tabloid journalists?  Flash forward 50 years or so, and the secretive Evelyn Hugo, now almost 80, is ready to tell her story.  With seven husbands to her credit, and myriad lies and covers ups to be shared, it is apt to be scathing.  I read this shortly after Daisy Jones and the Six.  It wowed me, and so did this one.  Looking forward to seeing what else this author has out there."
2136,2.0,"I guess I've figured out that I just don't like books in which a lot of things actually happen. Especially, unless they are legitimate events of historical record, lots of Big Momentous Things. This book features many such big momentous things, as evidenced by the title alone. Seven marriages are just a mere handful of candies in this big old movie-theatre-sized box of melodramatic Whoppers. Which left me wondering: how can a book in which so many things happen be so darn dull?? I guess I just prefer books in which people merely navel-gaze. Well, you've been warned!To be fair, I suspected I wouldn't like this book in the first place - which, counterintuitively, is precisely how I ended up reading it ...or rather, listening to it. I finally caved to the omnipresent podcast and public radio ads extolling the virtues of audiobooks as a kind of Viagra for enhancing reading productivity. I've never been an audiobook fan: though I can listen to podcasts and NPR until the cows come home, even if they're super duper slow and meander-y cows, I've flunked out of every prior attempt to enroll myself in a legit audiobook. I suspect my brain is somehow connected to my eyeballs so that in order to truly consume and savor literature, the eyeballs need to be fully engaged and rolling about so that they can somehow magically transfer the words from the page to my brain - like the way you'd peel Necco Candy Buttons from their little paper backings and pop them into your mouth. This can be the only explanation for why, in contrast, my prior attempts at audiobook listening have been more like trying to whack open a piñata using only a Pixie stick.So once I'd succumbed to the pressure of an Audible subscription, I'd need to find a book in which I wanted to invest some time reading, but not enough to actually read it with my actual eyes - which, as discussed, is pretty much the only way I can effectively read anything. So, I want to read most books with my eyeballs if I want to read them at all. If there exists for me a margin of acceptable and worthwhile yet eyeball-free reading, it is apparently slim to nil.The more I talk about this, the more I acknowledge this project was destined to flop, but - enter Evelyn Hugo nonetheless. This didn't seem at all my sort of book, plus it was long - yet, so beloved by so many readers! And such a lovely cover to essentially function as my phone wallpaper for the duration of twelve hours of audiobook listening...twellllve hours of audioboooook liiiiisssssteeeniiiiinnngggg....Here's a newbie tip: maybe your inaugural audiobook isn't the equivalent of half a calendar day, ideally. Lesson learned! But what of the book itself? As mentioned: thought I probably wouldn't like it, and sure enough, didn't like it. Know thyself! But why? And the nominees for My Primary Causes of Dislike for This Book are...1. Predictable. Spend a couple minutes brainstorming what, from our enlightened 2017 perspective (ha!), you'd expect to happen in a dramatic ""rags to riches"" Hollywood story spanning from the 50s to the present. Yes, all those things probably happen in this book. ALL the things. But less is more sometimes! This book was like Celine Dion's backward tuxedo or Bjork's (bless her) swan gown when it should have been more like J. Lo's emerald Versace loincloth or Sharon Stone's black Gap tee.2. Unsurprising, and just a lack of ...style? There are such fabulous classic Hollywood/LA stories out there - Mildred Pierce, Three Faces of Eve, Sunset Boulevard - plus what I assume are some fantastic biographies of vintage stars, so why would I want to read such a straightforward blah-blah account of a fictitious star's rise to prominence?3. Wasn't ""meta"" enough - for lack of a better word? I was hoping for a more realistic look behind the scenes of Old Hollywood, but this story just seemed like the controlled Hollywood version of the behind the scenes Old Hollywood story. It had all the revelation of a ""Five Things to Know About...!"" piece in People Magazine. Or a carefully curated celebrity purse contents expose.4. Other gripes: characters were more types than people; most characters dramatically changed personality at some point in a manner not congruent with actual human developmental change; over-reliance on a ""surprise twist""/double-shocker ending; over-reliance on our interest in the narrator who isn't a fully developed character; pretty sentimental at times; even the supposedly good relationships were soap-opera-y and disturbing.What can I say? - I just didn't like it. By the end of 12 hours of this, I would have nearly divulged state secrets for relief, maybe. After the debacle of this and Little Fires Everywhere, two very doted upon books of the year that were both despised by me, I truly hope I'm not blacklisted from Goodreads. But, I read an audiobook, everyone, my first whole big audiobook! And that's Progress, if not perfection!"
2137,5.0,"For some reason, despite all the hype, I thought I wasn't going to like this novel based on the life of a glamorous actress and her seven marriages, but I was totally enthralled by it. Evelyn Hugo, now retired and living a reclusive life in New York has decided to auction her gowns for charity and to tell her life story, warts and all, to an aspiring junior magazine writer, Monique Grant. And what a story she has to tell! Monique has no idea why she has been chosen to write Evelyn's biography but is thrilled to be chosen and to listen to the details of Evelyn's life and loves over the course of several days. What she hears is certainly a different version of Evelyn's life to the public persona she was forced to present to support her fame and movie star status.The novel is a wonderful look not only at what it took to be a movie star from the 1950s to the 1980s - the pain, the struggle, having to keep up a publicly acceptable face - but also the changing times with regards to society's acceptance of sex, marriage and who you love. Listening to Evelyn's story gives Monique the strength and confidence to cope with the problems and changes in her own life and to accept who she is. Highly recommended for those who enjoy an absorbing read."
2138,5.0,"This swept me away and then knocked me the fuck out with that ending. Just claw my heart out of my chest and drag it along the hallway of my flat, I don’t mind at all. I loved everything. The flaws, the characters, the LIFE??? Omg I have no other words honestly.Taylor Jenkins Reid has smashed it out the park with every novel of hers I’ve read."

2140,5.0,"☆ 5 googol stars Buddy read with the amazing Nashita, Shay, and Mrunal 💚This was a masterpiece. From beautiful writing to breathtaking plot, this book stole my heart. I haven't read anything quite like this - I incorporated so many more elements into one book than I would have ever thought possible.…
How this book was created-
5 gallons - beautiful writing5 gallons - sapphic romance5 gallons - amazing characters5 gallons - breathtaking plot10 gallons - hopeless bookworms... Hollywood icon Evelyn Hugo is ready to tell the truth about her life of beauty and scandals. Evelyn makes the surprising choice to have unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant tell her story. Monique is not at her best - her husband has left and her career is going nowhere. In order to tell Evelyn's story, Monique will listen to learn about Evelyn’s life from Evelyn herself. Monique has started to feel a real connection with Evelyn, but eventually, it becomes clear that Monique's life intersects with Evelyn's in a shocking and unchangeable way. Evelyn Hugo's life was in no way perfect. But it is so beautiful and raw, that I still love every detail of it. 
 ' ""OK,"" I say. ""What is it?"" Evelyn's mood tuns a bit darker. ""I'm not a good person, Monique. Make sure, in the book, that that's clear. That I'm not claiming to be good. That I did a lot of things that hurt a lot of people, and I would do them over again if I had to."" ' 
 Evelyn tells everything the way it is. She is not ashamed of who she is, nor of the things that she has done. She has experienced so much, and she is written in a way that makes so much sense for someone who has been through so much - she is someone who has learned so much through what she has been through and is finally confident to say it. Celia is hilarious and kind in all the right ways.
“And just as she was about to leave the microphone, she said 'And to anyone tempted to kiss the TV tonight, please don't chip your tooth.”
 She is so funny, cute, and breathtaking, at the same time. The entire story is told through Evelyn’s memory, and it is so clear that Celia is such an important person to Evelyn. She is the love of Evelyn Hugo’s life - this sapphic duo was so unbelievably perfect. Anytime they would get into a fight, it was so painful, and when they were broken up, I was just not emotionally okay. Harry is so wholesome. His character is just pure comfort - for the readers, and for Evelyn. He is Evelyn’s best friend, and he is such an important example of how a best friend can be more important than anything else. (Am I forgetting someone?)Oh... John - He did not have as much of a presence in the story as Celia, Evelyn, or Harry… so I do not have as much to say. With that being said, he had a great presence in the story for the time that he was present in it.  The Seven Six Husbands...🔪🔪🔪MURDER 🔪🔪🔪All of the husbands, accept for one. I wish that Evelyn had killed at least one of them "" when he came home, I took the kitchen knife, and he was dead-""However, Evelyn is a busy woman, and I forgive her for not doing as I wished…(I have an obsession with stories about wives killing their husbands)The 
Plot
*faints*We should just simply take a moment of silence, to truly appreciate this plot. *silence*To start off, the way it was written - this book takes place over a much longer period of time then most books do. And, along with that, it had a lot of details. Oftentimes, with books that have plot taking place over time, the author makes cuts like “two years later, blah blah blah…”, and this book did do that. However, ( I have no Idea how Taylor Jenkins Reid did this) but the changes just felt seamless and clean - I never felt it was annoying, or ruined the story. So, about the actual plot…
“No one is just a victim or a victor. Everyone is somewhere in between. People who go around casting themselves as one or the other are not only kidding themselves, but they’re also painfully unoriginal.”
It was so amazing to get to see one whole person’s life, even if they are fictional. One thing that I noticed, is that the book is titled “the seven husbands” as if everyone has not already noticed that, and that the book is divided into sections titled with each husband. However, in my opinion, the whole focus and meaning of the book is not really about that. However, I think that the book being titled “the seven husbands”, and it being sectioned by husband, might be a way of showing how what you see at first glance(title & sections)is very different from the real truth and feelings - just like how the media perceived Evelyn.Another one of my favorite parts of this book was the romance. 💖💖💖💜💜💜💙💙💙 It will make you emotionally unstable, and break your heart.I really can’t say a whole ton about the plot without spoiling it, so I guess I will have to leave it here. 
“You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”
And finally, a little bit about the 
The Representation
. There could have been more, but there was still a great amount!
“Make them pay you what they would pay a white man”
Monique is biracial, and Evelyn is Cuban! It is also pretty sad to see how Evelyn dyed her hair, and changed herself for hollywood. But it really does show how biased Hollywood can be. In addition, there was bi & lesbiann rep. Which always makes me so incredibly happy…
“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary”
...All throughout this book, I continued to think about how much it reminded me of Taylor Swift songs. At first, I thought that it was just all the drama, romance, and feminism that made me feel like this book was so much like Taylor’s songs! However, as I continued reading the book, I realized that a lot of the book's deeper meaning connects back to some of the meanings of Taylor’s songs. So, I decided that I would change up the lyrics of two of my favorite Taylor Swift songs - one of them will be emotional *sobbing*, and the other one will be a bit more of a chaotic parody. Enjoy ❤️ (I have put all of the lyrics which I have left unchanged, in quotes & italics)

…😭😂❤️...Storytime ~ how I talked about this book in front of my english class So, In my English class, we do these things called “book talks”, and, me...being me, I did one on this book. I was underprepared, because I only had one day to prepare. Here is how it went-I was really excited to present this book. So, I frantically worked on my slideshow, adding quotes, a book summary, and *trying* to make it look aesthetically pleasing. However, as I said, I had no time to prepare, so the slideshow was sort of a mess.On the day of my presentation, I was so nervous, but I just went for it. It was hard to tell whether or not people were actually enjoying my presentation, but all of my classmates looked really bored. So probably not. As I said, I was very nervous, I was shaking, literally. I stumbled over words a lot, and had to correct myself pretty embarrassing. I remember trying to explain to everyone in my class how I felt like Evelyn’s life was a masterpiece, but I don’t think anybody got it. I think that the best part of my presentation was when I talked about how I liked the Old Hollywood setting, and how it was such an interesting place for a book to be set. Back to bad things! So then, when I went to the part about characters, It was so bad. All I had was a slide with a picture of Evelyn, a picture of Harry, and a picture of Harry. And, instead of actually explaining why I liked each character, I just said “The characters were great, and I liked the way that they interacted with each other.”I’m so stupid…So, I guess this is it. I’ve spent 6 hours on a gush review. Please read this book. It’s a blessing and a curse, every second. ༶┈┈⛧⛧⛧⛧⛧┈┈༶I'M CRYINGI JUST READ THE BEST IF NOT ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF MY EXISTENCEFULL REVIEW TO COME VERY SOON <33༶┈┈⛧⛧⛧⛧⛧┈┈༶"
2141,5.0,"As soon as I finished this I immediately wanted to start over and read it again, that’s how good it was. this book was so much more than I ever expected, it huurrttss that I put off reading it for so long. I highly recommend the audiobook. "
2142,4.0,"For me, this wasn't a story about ""accidents"" or ""mistakes""; it was about choices made with little or no regard for others, especially for loved ones.Does Evelyn Hugo recognize this in herself? Eventually.Does this make her a likeable character? That's up to the reader.Based on these questions, does this make for a well-written story? I thought so.Personally, this book felt like a mix of stories between real-life movie-star icons Elizabeth Taylor, Lana Turner and Ava Gardner. I enjoyed the ""behind-the-scenes"" look into the egotistical world of Hollywood and the endless need for awards, accolades and publicity, even through tabloid stories (which many stars encourage!)Note: I easily figured out one of Evelyn's reasons for asking Monique to write her biography; the other, well, I didn't see that one coming!Audiobook thoughts? Well done and enjoyable to follow!"
2143,5.0,"5/5No entiendo nada Mañana hago una reseña presentable porque estoy de luto por mi estabilidad emocional. un beso-------------------------------------- No sé por qué mi -intento de- reseña terminó con casi 100 likes pero me encanta ahre.---------------------------------------Ahora si. Sigamos. Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo es un libro recontra hypeado y no lo iba a leer hasta que me agarró el bichito de necesidad y lo compré (la gente más cercana ya habrá escuchado la historia pero básicamente el libro apareció en la librería de la nada cuando lo pedí y me pareció una señal y lo compré. Spoiler: creo firmemente que fue una señal). Tenía mUCHo miedo de leerlo por el hype pero me llevé una excelente sorpresa. Esta historia trata sobre superación y los grises en la vida. De la familia y el amor. De los extremos y los opuestos. De lo bueno y lo malo. De lo permitido y lo prohibido. Del querer, el desear y la obligación. Del crecimiento y la aceptación. Es un libro que desde un principio Evelyn dice que no es un ejemplo; que no es una buena persona y no está arrepentida de nada de lo que hizo. Nos presenta una tonalidad de grises completa a medida que pasa el tiempo y cambia de marido; a sí mismo nos presenta como ella va cambiando y madurando mientras continuamos la historia. Me pareció excelente, una hermosa historia y la complejidad del personaje de Evelyn hizo que me dieran ganas de releerlo al momento que cerré el libro.  Evelyn me enseño muchísimo y, si bien no pienso ponerla en un pedestal y ponerla de ejemplo en todo, espero tenerla presente para cuando dude y no sepa que tomar de la vida.  Les dejo un fragmento para que disfruten: —¿Entiendes lo que quiero decirte? Cuando te dan una oportunidad de cambiar tu vida, debes estar dispuesta a hacer lo que sea con tal de lograrlo. El mundo no te da cosas: tú debes tomarlas. Si vas a aprender algo de mí, probablemente debería ser eso. Si son atrasadxs como yo y todavía no lo leyeron; leanlo. Lxs obligo. "
2144,4.0,"3.5 stars, rounded upFor all the fabulous reviews this book has gotten, it took a while to draw me in. Monique did nothing for me. And the narrator who handles her part felt too old. Once the book turned more to Evelyn, it did become more interesting. I love the atmosphere of “old Hollywood” that this evokes. Think the old movie magazines, the gossip, the star makers and breakers. Evelyn has her secrets but she’s finally willing to tell her true story. Evelyn is a strong woman and willing to do whatever it takes for her career. Growing up poor, she was never going back there again. I can’t say I agreed with all her moves, but I appreciated her resolve. While it’s a story of the old days, it’s truly a story for today. It deals with defying labels. In the end, it’s a love story. Parts were somewhat unbelievable. And at times, it dragged. But overall, a pleasant, interesting listening experience. "

2146,5.0," NOW LIVE!!! http://amzn.to/2sp9sDM  5 stars!   “I want them to know the real story. The real me.”“All right. Show me the real you, then. And I’ll make sure the world understands.”  Evelyn Hugo is an iconic aging actress, famous for her work in the movie industry but also famous for having been married seven times to seven men. Monique Grant is a writer for a magazine, but has been in a bit of a career rut as of lately. On top of that she’s getting divorced, so she jumps on the opportunity to interview the famous Evelyn Hugo. When she meets Evelyn, she discovers Evelyn wants more than a simple article, she wants to tell her life story to Monique for a biography. And Monique is getting the story exclusively.   “I’ve spent a very long time learning how to spin the truth. It’s hard to undo that wiring.”  I absolutely loved this story! Taylor Jenkins Reid has this uncanny ability to suck you into the lives of her characters and never let you go. They feel so utterly genuine, I felt as if I was a part of their lives instead of an outsider reading about them. Reid also does an amazing job developing her characters, I was rooting for all of them to get what they want and to achieve their goals.I never really know what to expect when I dive into a book by Reid, but I can honestly say this book was full of surprises and twists I didn’t see coming. This book spans from the 1950’s to the present day, and we get to know all of the loves of Evelyn’s life. Evelyn herself was enchanting, I found myself fascinated by her life story, her choices and her perseverance. While love was a motivating factor, to me this was mostly a story about success and survival. Evelyn was always going to do what it takes to be a star and stay at the top, and she would fight for what she wanted.Hollywood and the film industry can be a ruthless place but it can also be one where greatness can be achieved for the lucky ones. I think Reid captured the industry and the time periods this story took place in perfectly. This is one of the best books I’ve read all year and I think if you go into it with an open mind and a kind heart, you’ll fall in love with this book like I did.  “If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything.”   ARC provided by publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review Follow me on ♥ Facebook ♥ Blog ♥ Instagram ♥ Twitter ♥"
2147,5.0,"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is truly a well-crafted novel. It follows fictional It girl and actress, Evelyn Hugo, as she finally decides to share her story and the truth behind her many marriages. It blended a vivid character’s struggles and past effortlessly with the main storyline. It is honestly one of the best books I have ever read.

“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.”

 Evelyn Hugo was such a powerful character. The way the author developed her was seamless. She was such a polarising woman and I both liked and disliked her. The way in which her past was told was done cleverly and sophisticatedly and I honestly could not put this book down. Evelyn Hugo is not a perfect person. Hell, she’s not even a good person most of the time. But she was so realistic and the way she was portrayed was really accurate and made me feel so many things towards her: dislike, adoration, sympathy, frustration and most importantly, love. I adored Evelyn Hugo. I think she was a perfect example of how a woman can rise up against injustice and patriarchy and not let that define her journey. One thing I thought was really interesting was the parallel between what the world assumes about a certain celebrity and then the actual truth. When you read what people had to say about Evelyn and her seven husbands, it made her seem a certain way. But then watching her story unfold through her own perspective made me rethink every assumption I had about her from the way she was portrayed by how her society viewed her actions and decisions.

“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”

 I really liked the main narrator, Monique. I thought she was the perfect voice to contrast Evelyn’s and I really like the character development she went through in this book, especially when Evelyn’s life crossed into her own. That was done really well and I did not expect it at all. I think it was a great addition to the storyline and it really helped end the book in the perfect way. I also liked how diverse this book was and how it handled important topics such as divorce, sexuality, love and a woman’s claim to her own body. I think it was done in such a tactful and clever way, to the extent where it makes you feel so many things. I think the way sexuality was handled was done really, really well. There was a scene I really enjoyed between Monique and Evelyn where Evelyn states how she does not want to be labelled and put into a box. And as someone who hates labels and society’s need to define everything, it was a really dynamic scene which sent a really important message out. I felt a great deal of sympathy for Evelyn Hugo and the way things went about in her life. I cried a lot of times reading this book, especially towards the end but it was such an enjoyable experience. This book is now on my favourites list and I am definitely going to be rereading it sometime soon. 

“Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”

 The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a powerful book about a powerful character. It blended romance and sexuality with love and sacrifice and it did it so seamlessly and effortlessly. This is truly an amazing book."

 Can i hug Taylor Jenkins??? For writing this  PIECE OF HEART SHATTERING PERFECTION. *AHHH* Did this book rip my heart out??? OMG!!! YESSDid i lost my mind after reading it??? *nodding with full force*Did this book give me immense overthinking episodes???  YASS!! LAST NIGHT I ONLY SLEPT FOR 2.5 HOURS *not exaggerating, i was thinking about this book for hours* Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo is LEGIT A MASTERPIECE (if you don't agree with it go argue with a wall). I AM SO IN LOVE WITH THIS BOOK i just don't want to get over it, the reason why i love this piece of art is because in this book there's no victor or victim, everyone is flawed and did awful things in their lives, the rawness of the characters made this book so real and it explains so well that not a single human is perfect. This book is so realistic and still a fiction (I MEAN HOW COULD THIS BOOK CAN BE UNREAL, I WANT A REAL EVELYN, CELIA AND HARRY CAMERON PLIS) How will i ever recover from this book???? ""I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.""*i worship this quote* Evelyn Hugo is such a powerful character a one could ever read, i highkey admire how she is determined and passionate to succeed no matter how many huddles/barriers are thrown at her, how she always keeps her head high no matter how much people put her down was inspirational. I know she did some awful things but thats what make us humans (flawed and imperfect). ""People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy."" *OH LORD* I love how Taylor Jenkin covered such sensitive topics (racism, sexualities, alcoholism, domestic abuse, suicide, LGBTQ+ rights) *SHE DID SUCH A PERFECT JOB* The writing was impeccably poetic and so DAMN GOOD AND UNIQUE. *screams* OMG!! The setting, plot, characters, story descriptions were so beautifully written *chef's literal literal kiss* (yeah i purposely wrote two literals) *I PLEA YOU TO READ THIS BOOK* like  drop everything and read this gorgeous baby* ""It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.""   Happy Reading!!<"
2149,5.0,"Cuando empecé a leer este libro, pense: ""No hay forma de que puedan hacer que me parezca creible que alguien se casara siete veces"", que equivocada estaba.Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo es una historia sumamente realista, con un personaje principal que, como se dice varias veces, no es bueno, ni malo, simplemente es ambas.Los personajes son muy buenos, desde Celia, la cual debe convivir con el hecho de que sus dos deseos mas grandes nunca seran compatibles: triunfar como actriz y amar libremente. Luego tenemos a Harry, mi favorito, quien se convierte en el mejor amigo, confidente y familia de Evelyn. Harry es alguien muy querible, una gran persona que tampoco puede ser quien es gracias a la mie*da de sociedad de ese entonces. Por ultimo, tenemos a Evelyn Hugo, en cuya vida sufrio mucho, pero tambien amo, fue amada y fue feliz. Creo que todos los personajes son sumamente realistas. Me encantó la forma de narrar de la autora, te lleva de un marido a otro y vos, como lector, crees que verdaderamente estas leyendo una biografia. Muchas veces llegue a pensar que Evelyn Hugo habia existido y queria ver sus peliculas, verla en las alfombras rojas...Sin duda fue muy adictivo y, al no ser un género que acostumbre leer, novedoso.El único problema que le veo es todo el hype que tiene. Es ESPECTACULAR, pero estoy segura de que si uno comienza a leer sin tenerle taaantas expectativas, lo amaria.Cuando leia, estaba buscando ese libro que todos aman, y eso no fue favorable.Igualmente, hay una clara razon de que sea tan popular, vale la pena 100%.Lo recomiendo muchisimo☆☆☆☆☆"
2150,5.0,"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was an experience. I didn't really know what to expect of it but I had hope, and it was beyond amazing.It's not often when a book makes me look at my own life and try to see myself in the hero's position to see if I could make the same decisions, and this book made me do that.Evelyn was character incredibly well fleshed out. One of the most interesting characterizations I've read in a while. Not only she was complex but she was incredibly relatable. Everyone can see themselves in Evelyn Hugo and that is a huge accomplishment.Her life, her decisions, her mistakes and her achievements were on display for us to witness and understand. To judge if we wanted but also to teach us a lot.This book kept me on the edge, wanting more and more and the audiobook was amazing. It was such a plus and I think I enjoyed it more this way.There were a few tears during my reading and I'm typing this on the notes of my phone trying not to look too weird if about to cry on the bus on my way back from work but this story was so amazing I don't think there's a way to improve it. It's perfect.Reading about a woman way ahead of her time trying to make her way to Hollywood and endure all that she did and losing so much while gaining almost the same was raw and powerful.Evelyn Hugo was not a good person but she was a force to be reckon with. She lived her life by her own terms and died the same way. There is a lot to admire in her character and all she loved.I don't think there's going to be a day I don't think about Evelyn Hugo. From now on, whenever I'm facing something difficult, I'll think ""what would Evelyn Hugo do?"" and start from there."
2151,4.0,"A fascinating look at the lives of the rich and famous as Evelyn Hugo, retired film actress and blonde bombshell, tells the story of her life. And what a life! Self made millionairess and Oscar winner, she has also made her way through seven husbands, some of them married for love and some for practical purposes. And yet none of them were the love of her life. Evelyn tells her story to Monique with whom she apparently has a link. We have to wait for almost all the book to find out what it is and it is quite a shocker! I really enjoyed reading this one. The story flowed along nicely in such a way that I wanted to keep going on to each successive chapter. I needed to find out what happened next! I thought the author handled several sensitive issues well especially as the attitudes of the day were quite different to now.A really entertaining read with great characters and a good story. It left me with lots to think about."
2152,5.0,"5/5 ⭐“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.” Evelyn Hugo has stolen my heart - and I don't think I want it back. Nothing I write will do this book justice. But I guess I'll give it a try.We should start off with the main character - our dear Evelyn. Such a powerful character, straight forward, charismatic, captivating, inspiring. The more I read, the more I needed to know. All the characters have amazing well developed stories, and the interactions between them were so well written.It had been a long time since I had read such a good book, and I know it will be even a longer time for me to read something I enjoy as much - it really set the bar high. No need to say it became my favourite book, and I´ll keep recommending it until everyone reads it."
2153,5.0,"Oh my God, this was an amazing book! The plot was so interesting and I couldn't really put the book down anymore; this is definitely one of the best novels I've read this year so far and it deserves all the hype it's receiving at the moment. What's kinda scary though is that I don't think I would've picked this book up solely based on its synopsis and that I would have missed out on a book I loved if it hadn't been for all the people who told me to just read it because it's amazing. I mean, who knows how many books there are that have the potential to become some of my favorite books but that I'll never read because they just don't sound like books I'd usually enjoy reading?So I'm incredibly happy that I picked this book up even though it's very unlike what I usually read. I honestly loved ""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" so much and it's definitely one of those books that I hope will be made into a movie one day because I think it would look great on screen. Five out of five stars to this masterpiece of a book!"
2154,4.0,"Here's a well done late summer vacation read- this is a very entertaining and absorbing story full of old school Hollywood glamour. A reclusive screen siren in her late seventies, Evelyn Hugo, summons an unknown junior writer at Vivant magazine, Monique Grant, to write her biography. It is made clear from the start that Evelyn has some ulterior motive for selecting Monique and part of the fun is trying to puzzle that out (it won't be exactly what you think it is). The real story, though, is Evelyn's as she narrates her life story to Monique. She's an unusual character, unlikeable at times, but very frank and candid about her choices and decisions in life.Just this side of ""chick lit,"" but well done with a refreshing modern twist. I liked it. Not great literature, but a good story well told that you'll lose yourself in for a few days.Thanks to Simon and Schuster for the gift of a hardcover copy of this book - love that colorful cover!"

2156,5.0,"5 Why did I take so long to read this book starsEveryone told me to read this book. Everyone told me I would LOVE this book. I didn't listen. It sat and sat and sat on my shelf. This month, for whatever reason - it called to me. It was time. I read it. And.... you were all right - I FREAKIN LOVED IT! How do you even write a review that gives this book the justice it deserves? I can't, I won't. Just know that Evelyn Hugo's life was complicated, sad, beautiful and absolutely enthralling. She was a force to be reckoned with as she dealt with race, sexuality, societal norms, poverty, wealth & privilege, love and loss. This book was about so many things - so much more than I ever expected it would be. Yet, aside from all of those things I was left with the ultimate lesson that this life we live is short so we shouldn’t spend it pretending to be someone we aren’t, letting happiness slip through our fingers."
2157,5.0,"Me gustó muchísimo.Un libro con mucha representación LGBT, que habla sobre las estrellas de Hollywood, sobre los sacrificios que deben hacer, las cosas que deben ocultar y como nuestra protagonista Evelyn atraviesa su sexualidad en un mundo que vive pendiente de cada paso que toma.La historia comienza con Monique, una periodista que es llamada por la célebre Evelyn Hugo para realizarle una entrevista. Monique desconoce por qué Evelyn la elige a ella y acude a escuchar lo que la estrella de Hollywood tiene para contarle.Evelyn le va a narrar la historia de su vida, de sus siete maridos, cómo llegó a la fama y quién era su verdadero amor.El libro se lee muy rápido, muy entretenido y con mucho diálogo. Me gustó mucho que los protagonistas sean grises, cometan errores y que no sean moralmente buenos siempre. Me gustó mucho el vínculo que tienen varios personajes y como están condicionados por la prensa y la fama.Sumamente recomedadado, con muchas frases y enseñanzas importantes.Yo leyendo los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo: 😳🥺🥰😊😭"

2160,5.0,"Evelyn Hugo was once an Oscar-winning movie star who graced the gossip magazine pages for her off-screen relationships as much as her on-screen actions. She is a now a reclusive former star who still shines brightly and remains enough of an enigma to have journalists clamouring for information concerning her. Monique, despite owning little notoriety and a low-grade job, is the lucky individual chosen to deliver Evelyn's story.Evelyn Hugo had my heart from the very first moment both Monique and the reader became introduced to her. She remained a formidable presence and an elusive individual until the final pages, despite the story of her life that was slowly revealed throughout the course of the book. The author did an incredible job of crafting both this elite persona and the world of old Hollywood that she invited us into.This became a more heartfelt story than the one I was anticipating. Evelyn Hugo might have owned enviable facial features and society's 'perfect' body shape, and she might have seemed like a flirtatious and uncaring individual, with the slew of men she left in her wake, but the truth about her identity and the relationships she entered into could not be any more different than the carefully crafted image she presented to the rest of the world. Loneliness and pain were with her across every step of her journey from poor Mexican girl residing in Hell's Kitchen to blonde bombshell, seven-times divorcee, and Oscar-winning movie star, and so was I."
2161,5.0,"I finally read #thesevenhusbandsofevelynhugo & it did not disappoint. It was an amazing, immersive and beautiful read. .It talked about so many important topics such as diversity, sexuality, women in the workplace, lgbtq rights and so much more. .I loved every second of this book and I was so sad it ended. And it had such an amazing plot twist at the end that I did not see coming at all..Bottom line is, this book is beyond hyped. I think it’s fully worth the hype and I loved every minute of it. It’s definitely one of my favorite books of this year, hands down..My rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
2162,5.0,"Buddy Read with dear Macy xxok so i just finished this? and i'm too busy crying to make this a good review so you'll have to deal with a bit of a mess here.first off; this was one of the most beautifully written books i've read in quite a while. the writing was delicate and precious and i held every word in my heart. and then there were the characters. my darling Evelyn was quite the opposite to delicate, she knew what she had to do to get out of the place where she'd grown up, and she knew what she'd have to do to get all the way to hollywood. and what she had to do was heartbreaking and tough and no-one should have to face it, but she overcame those situations. in fact, no, she OWNED those situations and she took what she wanted and everyone else better have moved out of her way because Evelyn Hugo is coming through and she's about to tear down this safe wall you've built around your heart. and then there was our other main character, baby Monique, sweet and sensitive and a little bit broken but learning to grow stronger every day she spent with Evelyn. i also loved Monique and could relate to her so easily, and i really loved the big reveal about Monique at the end. it was a massive surprise and a pretty big shock to swallow, but it was all the better for that. and then there was my absolute,  absolute , favourite character. brillaint, kindhearted, tortured Harry Cameron. the biggest sweetheart to the very centre of his being, and the number 1 husband of Evelyn. gay and heartbroken after his love dies, Harry is, and will always be, a blessing to this world and to my heart. god bless that man. right along with Monique, we - the readers - progress through Evelyn's lives, loves and failures, and cry and laugh right along with her. or both. the ending broke all our hearts multiple times over and we will never forget this book or Evelyn and her seven husbands... and one wife.Poor Ernie DiazGoddamn Don AdlerGullible Mick RivaClever Rex NorthBrilliant, kindhearted, tortured Harry CameronDisappointing Max GirardAgreeable Robert Jamisonand beautiful, loving Celia St. James"
2163,4.0,"I began reading The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo assuming that it would be a fictional, gossipy tell-all about a movie star's life from the 50's onward. In other words a light book to begin while traveling. Read on one level, it is. Evelyn is part Marilyn Monroe, part Elizabeth Taylor, part Bette Davis and she does marry seven times but not for reasons you might think. Evelyn's scandalous life story is a hot property and she chooses to tell it to an unlikely reporter. Sounds juicy to me.Read on another level, this book confronts many social and women's issues that are, unfortunately, still true today. I don't want to give away too much so suffice it to say that I was impressed and pleased that The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was much, much more than I had anticipated. By the way, my three hour flight felt like it took three minutes."
2164,4.0,"OUT OF FIVERATING: 3.5PLOT: 3.5CHARACTERS: 4ROMANCE:3This book was a bit disappointing, the keyword here being ""a bit""There's so much hype for this book and honestly, its not so hard to see why. However, the thing is, there were some aspects that didn't really do it for me. When I read this, I was really not in a good mood so take this review with a grain of salt.Are the characters great? YES, they're well made. Evelyn is such a complex character with complex emotions, she's one of those characters that you either love for her defiance or hate for her bad choices or maybe just feel indifferent about because you couldn't care any less whatever the fuck she decides to do with her life. I'm the indifferent one here.“When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things.”A character of note that I'd love to mention is HARRY CAMERON! He is the sweetest person ever and his relationship, platonic of course with Evelyn was honestly one of my favorite aspects of the whole book. I love how they had each other's backs and honestly, its so wholesome ugh.  It was written in a biography style with general detailing of every single one of her seven husbands. An alternative title would be The seven husbands of Evelyn hugo and the one love of her life because that's basically the plot. Seven husbands, some good, some downright terrible and some they got together for contract purposes. Yet, she emerged as a great movie star, a great mom and a wife. Throughout the book, various mentions were made about her one wife whom she truly loved that no one knew about.“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.” Evelyn has seen abuse, she's been exploited, she has seen good times and ugly times and she has done things, most of which she would do again if she had to go back. She's rich, defiant, isn't afraid to do what she has to do to get what she want and fucking bad ass but even then my opinion of her was just eh.I do like one thing about her though, she's so fucking real!“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.” The writing style was unique and lovely It made it quite easy to follow the story. Written by Monique, we get to see things from both their point of views. There's something else that makes the plot interesting. Why did she choose underconfident, introverted and recently divorced Monique?? Don't ask me, I ain't giving out spoilers.“I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.”The plot was definitely good and the pacing...righteous!. It wasn't too slow or too fast. It was just right and then, the plot twist at the end?? I didn't see it coming in a million years and for that I'd like to applaud the author.However, there were a few things I didn't enjoyCecilia and Evelyn's relationship: Am I the only one that felt it was toxic at times??They had chemistry no doubt but the way they kept on breaking each other, over and over again. It made me so frustrated that they'll ignore the basic things that make up a healthy relationship. I'll still mention that at that age and time, it was fitting. However, it doesn't mean I have to like it!I would point out that it got progressively better as they grew older and so it has development. The supposed ""emotional"" ending: Was I surprised by the turn of events?? Yes! Did I like the ending?? Not really.I felt hollow when the book ended not because of any emotion whatsoever but because I was expecting more! I just ended so abruptly that I didn't even feel anything. I wasn't sad, no tears. I just felt a whole bunch of nothing and that's the basic reason why I'm giving it this rating. Maybe its just my mood but I didn't like it that much.The way their races were represented felt a bit awkward It was like the author was shoving it in my face. Here, Evelyn is Cuban. A latina!!!Here, Monique(the writer) is biracial!!no development whatsoever or unfolding this by using the usual racial prejudice expected in the time frame.But the author is white so it might be unrealistic if she wrote it like that, but still, it doesn't mean I have to like it!As my BR partner rightly puts it, ""I don't want to judge it so early on, but so far I wish there was more tie ins to both protagonist's background. Because when white authors do this it feels like its just for diversity points without actually doing the research. And I feel like TJR choosing racially ambiguous characters was a cop out instead of actually getting informed enough to write an unambiguous black & Latina character. And it was so awkwardly inserted in the first few paragraphs that both characters are they races that they are. Like it wasn't gradually indicated through character building sentiments. Just very random and blatant.""Apart from the few complaints, the book was good. Not the best thing but it could be worse and it could be better.Pre read thoughtsFinally reading this!!!!!!!!Also buddy read with Dasani<3Edit: I've come to the conclusion that there's something ultimately wrong with me. I didn't really like this as much as I thought I would. I felt no emotion...it could just be me being bitchy because I'm not on my best moods but I did laugh at some parts and get angry at some parts so yay for that. Albeit, I expected more from this . Not a fan of Evelyn or Cecilia but i did like this a bit so 3.5 stars.Full RTC (i hope my lazy ass gets to it eventually)"

""I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, 'I'm in love with Celia St. James!' and let them crucify me for it.""
How can it even be possible for one person to write prose so beautifully? To use words that just float off the page and sentences that sound as lyrical as a song? It shouldn’t be, but this book proved that it is. And it wasn’t even my favourite part. I am immensely glad that this was my 300th book of the year. 
⇢The Plot & Writing
To say I wasn’t intrigued from the start would be a lie. Evelyn’s mysteriousness and subtle I’m-better-than-you-and-I-know-it personality had me invested in learning her story right from the very beginning, and the fact that she had chosen Monique to do the job for reasons unknown made me only too enraptured by her as well. Together, as storyteller and audience, they has an obvious connection that felt personal, almost as if they were family. But we’ll get into more of that later. The chapters that focused on Evelyn’s story were divided by her seven husbands, and each glimpse into her life was perfectly written. I felt connected to her each time despite the fact that with each new husband she became a different person, or rather, put on a new mask to fit the role she wanted to play. The whole thing just goes to show that nothing and no one is ever as they seem. I was certainly reminded of that many times.
“Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn't know her power, but I'm sick of all that.”
 
⇢The Characters
I fell in love with so many characters in this book. Of course Evelyn herself, with her cunning lies and hidden truths, Celia, with her faux innocence and true goodness, and Harry, the beautiful soul who perhaps resonated with me most of all. I even loved John, who we learned so little about, and Connor, who we didn't have nearly enough time with. Wise words from a certain character about whom I would read a whole other book:
“Isn’t it awfully convenient,” Harry added, “that when men make the rules, the one thing that’s looked down on the most is the one thing that would bear them the greatest threat? Imagine if every single woman on the planet wanted something in exchange when she gave up her body. You’d all be ruling the place. An armed populace. Only men like me would stand a chance against you. And that’s the last thing those assholes want, a world run by people like you and me.”

⇢The Storytelling
I loved the way this story was told. It wouldn’t have been the same if we had been following Evelyn’s life rather than seeing her tell it to Monique because revealing the truth after everyone else in it is dead has some sort of allure to it, doesn’t it? And then the way Evelyn’s story influenced Monique’s reality was fantastic. It showed just how important Evelyn’s story was because even before it was written it was allowing someone to take control of her life and be brave.
“Evelyn looks at me with purpose. ""Do you understand what I'm telling you? When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.”
 The interconnection and parallels between the past and the present were incredible. (I’m going to run out of positive adjectives at this point). I think my favourite was Evelyn and Harry’s platonic soulmate love in contrast to the philia (friendship-love) between Monique’s parents. The way Evelyn described her best friends was uncannily similar to the way Monique’s mother described her husband. 
“If there are all different types of soul mates,” I told Harry one afternoon, when the two of us were sitting out on the patio with Connor, “then you are one of mine.”
This book was obviously going to be heart-wrenching. I just didn’t realize quite how interconnected everything was going to be. Nothing affects me quite as a storyline that transcends generations. I suspected there was a deeper reason for Evelyn choosing Monique but I never guessed that it would be what it was. Overall, I understood Evelyn’s reasons for telling the truth, especially after experiencing her life in her own words. And after all, she did warn Monique that the worst was yet to come… I think what really resonated with me wasn’t just Evelyn Hugo and her story, but the fact that so many people must have gone through something similar. Not the movie stardom or the seven husbands, but the being in love with someone society tells you you can’t have. And Evelyn had Celia, albeit in secret. She had Harry. She had Connor. So many others must have gone through the same thing sans confidantes, and that, above all, is heartbreaking to consider. 
“Say to them, “Evelyn Hugo just wants to go home. It’s time for her to go to her daughter, and her lover, and her best friend, and her mother.” Tell them Evelyn Hugo says good-bye.”

2168,4.0,"I write this advice first so that you don't miss it: if you liked this book (or even if you liked the premise but were disappointed), read Any Human Heart by William Boyd, an autobiography of a fictive artist. It's even better!I wouldn't be able to review a book more than one month later if it didn't move me, but I remember this one perfectly. The characters of this story felt real to me (the story of Evelyn Hugo, not the one of the journalist...) and I just wanted to meet them. I really liked to discover Hollywood's life during these years.I wasn't looking forward to finish it, it was a page turner even if there wasn't a big mystery. It lost half a star because of some lenghts and repetitive actions (4.5 rounded down).Thanks to Taylor Jenkins Reid for getting me out of my comfort zone, I really appreciated my reading time"
2169,5.0,"[reread May 2020 bc this book is just so eternally good]I'm coming to find that with this book, and with every reread, I will come to relate even more deeply with Evelyn Hugo depending on the point I am in my life. Whether it's her fierce ambition to get ahead, her position as a bisexual woman, or her listening to her brain rather than her heart. Because of it, it makes me think a lot more deeply about what I want from myself and my life too.What I also enjoy about TSOEH is how romantic it is, but how it is the jagged, raw, realistic romance. In books, all too often the love interests are charming and witty and attractive, and their flaws are a little glossed over. Not so here. Evelyn and Celia are incredible, but the book is also honest with how they have hurt each other. Evelyn prioritised her work over Celia; Celia questioned Evelyn's ability as an actress and criticised her string of marriages. Both are ambitious women, and I admire them both incredibly. Throughout the narrative they both develop as characters, fixing past mistakes with newer actions. To me, that lends a depth of realism and credibility that serves to make this entire book even more genuine, and their relationship even more meaningful. There is little doubt that TSEOH remains deserving of a full five stars and a position as one of my lifetime favourites. **[first read, December 2018]OKAY, THANKS FOR ATTACKING ME LIKE THAT, BOOK. // I had heard prior praise, but I didn’t expect my heart to be shredded and chewed up and spit out savagely and I am just so so sooo in love - At first glance, The Seven Husbands Of Evelyn Hugo looks to be a chick-flick-y, slightly scandalous heterosexual romance novel about an actress and her many husbands - and then it drops a load on you, laughs, and reveals itself to be an unashamedly queer novel with a proud bisexual and Cuban actress heroine, and centres on her love for another woman. Besides being f/f, it discusses the problems of being homosexual from the 1950s onward, and how destructive for your life and career it could be if you were seen in a same-sex relationship or even known to be lgbtq+. It is also proudly feminist, with Evelyn Hugo adopting a post-feminist stance on her sexuality and the use of her body. It covers a few other topics too - how bisexuality is often challenged as being not a “real” sexuality (the argument people often bringing up being that you’re either straight or you’re gay/lesbian, there is no middle ground); the obstacles society places in front of those who are biracial; and the Hollywood whitewashing when it comes to actresses who have names that aren’t white/don’t look white. There’s a lot of themes throughout this novel that are mediated upon, and it’s all very thought-provoking.I read this over the course of one day - that’s how invested I was. Every time I went to put it down, I came back to pick it up moments later. It was easily-read and addicting, filled with beauty and tragedy and hope and heartbreak. At the end I had been crying on and off for a good 50 pages. And the final twist! I didn’t see it coming. I knew there had to be some kind of relation between Evelyn and Monique, the journalist interviewing her, but the reveal was so shockingly devastating and incredibly well-done. And the characters are so well-realised: loveable, admirable, and also deeply flawed like all humans are. This book builds on you. At first it was a solid 4 stars, then as it went on it was a 4.5, and then by the end there was no other rating for it, in my eyes, than a full 5 stars. Because it Went There and Did That, and wrapped it all up in a beautiful package. And now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to recommend this to everyone I know."
2170,5.0,"I don't know why I put off reading this book so long but I just did. I recently read Daisy Jones and gave it a 5-star rating, loving it so much that I was determined to read this book in the first quarter of 2020 and I'm so glad I did! This book was so much more than a story about an actress that had seven husbands, it was a love story told over decades, and an LGBTQ one at that! didn't see that one coming, and it made it so much more enjoyable for me, being a gay man myself. This story crushed my heart so many times that in good conscience I couldn't give it anything less than five stars. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a phenomenal writer and may very well go on my auto-buy list! 2 books down both garnering five stars, I may very well go back and read all of her previous novels if they are this good. I would recommend this book to a variety of genre fans. it's definitely not one you want to miss out on! Shame on me for waiting so long to give this one a read!"
2171,5.0,"4.5 Stars rounded up to 5CW: (view spoiler)[sexual content, domestic violence, underage sex, cheating, drunk driving, abortion, drugs, alcohol, homomisia, bimisia, lesbomisia, suicide, loss of loved ones in car accident and illness, misogyny (hide spoiler)]Well that was an absolutely amazing reading experience!I could not stop listening to this incredibly well narrated, beautifully written, and engaging story until I got through to the emotional and lovely last line. It felt like I was listening to a yarn. A smoothly told tale of an actress fighting to establish herself in an industry that saw women as pretty baubles. The writing was wonderful and it seemed to just flow and sweep me into this world of glamorous facades. I loved every moment of it. "
2172,5.0,"I didn't read many reviews prior to starting this one. I saw that a lot of my friends gave it 4 and 5 stars. I have read one book by this author before and was not impressed but I gathered that this one spanned a number of decades and it sounded like my cuppa tea.I grew up in the era (gosh, that makes me sound ancient) where you got your books from the library! That was it! We couldn't really afford to buy books. If you were lucky, at Christmas, you got a book. So the library was my oasis for books ... I loved those epic tales that spanned decades ... Sidney Sheldon, Dannielle Steele, Jeffrey Archer! ""The Thorn Birds"" - anyone remember that one? This book reminded me of those stories. It tells the story of Evelyn over a period of almost 70 years. 
“It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.”

“When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things.” 
It's a book you cannot really say too much about. You are better off just reading it and living the story.
“forgiveness is different from absolution.” 
A fascinating, epic tale. I literally could not put the book down!"

2174,5.0,"The Seven Husbands of Evelyn HugoThis is the first book I have read by Taylor Jenkins Reid and I was very excited to start it because of all the great reviews here on GR.It was an ideal book to curl up on the sofa with, during a dull February! Sinking into the exciting and extravagant world of old Hollywood was fascinating. An older Evelyn was telling her life story for the first time to journalist Monique Grant. We were taken through the early years of Evelyn’s life, how she was determined to become a Hollywood star and of course how she came to meet and marry her seven husbands. I thought the inserts of tabloid/ magazine articles amusing, they cleverly gave you a feel of public option at that time in history. The book revolves around relationships, homophobia, abuse and sexism. The choices that some of the characters made were hard to understand at times, but I had to keep reminding myself , that we were back in the 1950/60’s and views were obviously very different back then. So much has already been said about this book, so that’s it! I loved the glamour and vibe and I would recommend you get on and read it, if you haven’t already. 😊"
2175,5.0,"Wow. I did not see this coming. At all. Most of the time, while reading this book, I was thinking about how much I liked the story, but I wasn't feeling the same thing everybody else seemed to feel while reading this. It was almost like I was missing something. I enjoyed it, but I wasn't blown away by it.And then I got near the end and I don't think a book has ever made me cry this hard. I cried like I lost a dear friend.This book really lives up to the hype. And if you are going to read this, and maybe feel like I did because you don't see what that big fuss is about (yet), then just keep on going. This book is heartbreaking, amazing, ugly, horrible and beautiful. Kind of like life itself.----------Yeah, watch me jump on that bandwagon!"

2178,1.0,"Wow that was awful. The content is of the supermarket tabloid variety and the writer lacks all subtlety and grace. She might as well have beaten you over the head with a mallet as introduce her themes. This book is the stuff that gives ""chick lit"" a bad name."
2179,5.0," Edit 1/14 I just finished this book a few days ago and I'm missing it.  Review   “Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.” People kept talking about  The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo; they kept saying how great it was, how everyone should read it. Naturally, I was intrigued by why people loved it so much. I knew that it was about Evelyn (obviously) and a few things about her (such as she's Cuban and bisexual), but I didn't know anything else besides that. And wow...this book contained so much more than I had expected: great representation (LGBT+ and racial), discussions about relationships (romantic and platonic), power dynamics, societal norms, and being your authentic self. Reid discusses these things in a way that isn't forced - it's just part of the narrative. And although I listened to this on audiobook, I think that it just increased the impact of this book - I felt like Evelyn was sitting down with me, telling me about her life.  What is this story about?  Well, I think it's better to not know much about what this story is about, but to put it simply, it's about Evelyn Hugo telling Monique (a journalist) about her life.  Characters  There are a host of characters in this novel, so I'm going to focus on the most important ones.  Evelyn  Originally from Cuba, Evelyn moves to the US. She has a dream of becoming an actress and she pursues her dream. While I did not agree with everything Evelyn did, I loved her character. She wasn't afraid to go after what she wanted and I feel like she did grow throughout the novel. (view spoiler)[ She went from a person that used others to someone who tried to show compassion to others. Yes, she kept the truth from Monique about her father (and framed him). While I definitely disagree with what Evelyn did, I do think she genuinely wanted Monique to know how much her father loved her since she had a father who didn't love her. Also, I think, by giving her the letter, she was trying to atone for what she had done. It is clear throughout the story that Evelyn knows that she isn't a good person. While Evelyn made some questionable choices, she is a fantastic character.  (hide spoiler)]  Monique A journalist who interviews Evelyn. Through interviewing Evelyn, she learns more about herself. She, too, has a nice character arc.  Celia  An actress who works with Evelyn when Evelyn first starts to 'take off' in Hollywood. (view spoiler)[ And Evelyn's wife, of course. I loved Celia's character so much. I wish we could've seen Evelyn and her together even more.  (hide spoiler)]  Harry  Evelyn's best friend. He is kind, patient, and is constantly there for Evelyn. (view spoiler)[ I loved his and Evelyn's friendship so much. Harry deserved better - he deserved a happy ending, too. Sure, he shouldn't have drank and drove...but he deserved a happy ending.  (hide spoiler)]  Writing  This book is very well-written. While the writing may have been simple, it did not harm the story in the slightest.  Plot  I'm not going to say much about the plot. However, I will say that this is very much a character-driven story.  Overall Thoughts  About halfway through listening to the audiobook, I thought that this was going to be a solid 4 star book. I loved how Reid discussed various themes in her book. However, once I got to the final, like, 15% of the audiobook, this book climbed to 5 stars. This story is focused (in part) on being your true self. To try to not let others put you in a box...to show them your true colors. (view spoiler)[ Throughout the story, Evelyn is scared of being her true self. She wants to be with Celia, but she is afraid of what they will lose if the press/people found out that they were a couple. Now, given the time period, this is a very valid fear. However, this took a toll on Celia and Evelyn's relationship. By the end of the book, Evelyn is finally okay with showing the world who she truly is. One of my favorite quotes of the book is:  ""'No,' she told me. 'Because they are just husbands. I am Evelyn Hugo. And anyway, I think once people know the truth, they will be much more interested in my wife.'""  Evelyn also hides her Cuban heritage throughout the book. She is afraid to talk in Spanish because she has spoken English her whole life and hasn't shown the world that part of her. She feels like she has neglected that side of her. When she moves to Spain though, she lets that side finally shine through - she talks in Spanish to others, not worrying if they can't understand her or not. She wants to show them her true self.  (hide spoiler)] This story is so, so, powerful. Part of the reason why I gave it 5 stars is how much it resonated with me and how well-written it was. While Reid is not part of the LGBT+ community, I think she accurately portrayed the nuances of sexuality and how difficult it was to be part of the community during that time period. I could keep going on about this novel, but we'd be here for ages. This is a fantastic book and I'd recommend it to everyone.  Rating: 5/5 stars =============== Initial Reaction  Wow.Just....Wow.That was so powerful. Moving. Wow. Review to come."

Diles que a Evelyn Hugo no le importa si todos se olvidan de su nombre. A Evelyn Hugo no le importa si todos se olvidan de que alguna vez vivió. Mejor aún, recuérdales que Evelyn Hugo nunca existió. Fue una persona que yo inventé para ellos. Para que me quisieran. Diles que, durante mucho tiempo, estuve confundida con respecto a lo que era el amor. Diles que ahora lo entiendo, y que ya no necesito el amor de ellos.

AMAZING!!!	Realmente pensé que este libro no me iba a gustar WHAT A FOOL!! La premisa no me llamaba la atención, o sea ¿ leer sobre los siete maridos de una mujer? No es mi tipo de lecturas. Pero tiene tan buenas críticas que la puse en mi lista de quizás en un futuro pero me quedé sin lecturas y decidí leerlo  Es la mejor decisión que he tomado, porque me estaba perdiendo de un libro FANTÁSTICOLo primero que quiero destacar es la narrativa de la autora que es MARAVILLOSA, como empieza lentamente llevándote poco a poco enganchándote en la historia hasta que llegas un momento que estás tan metido en la trama que no puedes dejar de leer. ESTE LIBRO ES ADICTIVOLa historia de Evelyn Hugo podría haber sido la de Marilyn Monroe sino hubiera muerto, creo que Evelyn está basada en Marilyn. Evelyn Hugo fue una famosa actriz, desde la época de los 50´s a finales de los 80´s que se destacaba principalmente por su sensualidad y belleza. Ella contrata a una periodista y escritora para que escriba su autobiografía y se publique después de su muerte, lo curioso es que es escritora no es muy reconocida no tiene prestigio pero la pidió exclusivamente a ella. Durante la entrevista, Evelyn Hugo relata su historia de cómo empezó a soñar con ser actriz, cómo se convirtió en ello y llegó a la fama, los sacrificios que hizo como utilizó su cuerpo manipulo gente e hizo cosas moralmente cuestionables y en el proceso sus siete matrimonios que es por lo que más la recuerda la gente. También revela el misterio de quien de ellos fue el amor de su vida o ¿Será que ninguno de ellos fue realmente el amor de su vida?La autora nos lleva en un viaje en el tiempo de distintas épocas, pasamos por los 50´s la época de oro en Hollywood que fue de mis favoritas hasta llegar a los 80´s, detallando de las épocas de una manera no tan descriptiva, sino que te cuentas cosas como el vestuario, el comportamiento o eventos importantes que la caracterizaron.No se si ustedes vieron la bioserie de Silvia Pinal pues exactamente ese fue el vibe que me dio este libro que conocemos como comenzó, sus amantes, sus tragedias, sus momentos de felicidad, su fama y todo en ese viaje entre épocas.Hubo un momento que creí estar leyendo sobre un personaje real y me daban ganas de meterme a google y buscar imágenes de esta hermosa actriz, fotografías de los sucesos importantes hasta que recordaba que era un personaje ficticio.  y esto es nada más y menos que magia de la autora
Este es un libro, sobre la vida de una mujer llena de matices, algunos la pueden amar otras odiar pero nunca te va a dejar indiferente. Es un libro de sueños, sacrificios, traiciones, manipulaciones, pero sobre todo es un libro lleno de amor, amistad y la verdadera familia. 
Se los recomiendo ampliamente, y eso que no soy fan de recomendar libros porque para gustos los colores."
2184,5.0,"This is a book I would have totally ignored if it not for my GR friends reviews. With a title like that, the biggest question I and probably every lesfic reader have is--is this even for us? The answer is YES, with a bit of a caveat. Can you sit through seven before you get to THE one? :) I'm being necessarily vague here because that is one of the main mysteries of the book--who is the One True Love? On the other hand, it'd be a shame for lesfic lovers to give the book a miss just because of the male-centric title. So I'm going to spoil a bit of the mystery by confirming--yes--there is an f/f relationship and its worth the price of the book. I hope you get the hint. ;)Now as for the little caveat I mentioned earlier--the Seven Husbands. That's seven relationships with men we have to read through. Unfortunately, they're all legal. I know we're not into those so how bad is it? It's not actually. Some of them aren't even real. But some are. Though there's nothing explicit. The lead character, fabulous Hollywood actress Evelyn Hugo, is bisexual. So she's also into men. And we have to read through those. Its frustrating, yes. But its also strangely fascinating reading. The book is mostly a character study of a really astute, ambitious and complicated woman who doesn't hesitate to use her physical assets to get what she wants from men, but then, finds herself saddled with men who only love her physical assets. Karma? Lol. The seven hubbies are different enough that it never gets boring. Though it's not particularly deep either, since the story is told as a memoir by Evelyn and she is ever the pragmatist when it comes to dissecting her various relationships. The exception is, of course, her special relationships.It would be just another enjoyable, above-average read if it were only that. But the last 30% of the book really shone, and tore at my heartstrings all the way to the end. Have a box of tissues at the ready. The ending is one of the best I've read.....of all time. So real and so raw in its depth of emotion. So perfect--the way everything falls messily into place. So Evelyn Hugo. 4 stars for the first 70%5 stars for the last 30%Bonus points for the amazing ending."
2185,5.0,"i came here for some hollywood gossip and ended up bawling my eyes out. don’t let the title fool you - this is so, so much more than just an enumeration of infamous evelyn hugo's many husbands.while reading this, it gets obvious that taylor jenkins reid is an old hollywood fan. her writing is beautiful and rich in detail. i got some great gatsby vibes, despite this being set in a different era.while this story showcases the power plays in hollywood and the price one has to pay for fame, it is mainly concerned with evelyn being one thing: human. even though evelyn is a movie icon and i am a broke uni student, i could relate to her deeply. character-driven books usually tend to bore me, but evelyn is one of the best-written characters ever, which is why this was highly entertaining.evelyn is a woman in a men’s world. she is a cuban woman in a white women's world. she is a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to the same sex was demonised. she manages to overcome those obstacles, but also has to hide who she truly is, which ends up ruining her.the seven husbands of evelyn hugo is not only a page-turner, but also a life-changing book. it made me reconsider my thoughts on love, friendship, men, pressure, sex, and life in general. also, it boosted my self-confidence a lot. i love how great literature can influence me. if you like hollywood, you should read this. or if you like books written by woman for women. or if you’re into stories that revolve around lgbtq+ characters. or if you are interested in feminist topics. or if you like reading. or if you’re just a human being, read this book."
2186,5.0,"No se por donde empezar. Los Siete Maridos de Evelyn Hugo se convirtió, inesperadamente, en una de las mejores lecturas que tuve y, sin dudarlo de las que tendré este año. Una historia atrapante con mil giros inesperados, y una protagonista fuerte que se planta y narra una vida increíble. La escritura y su fácil lectura hace que rápidamente sientas cierta empatía hacia Evelyn, que creas cada palabra que de su boca sale este dirigida especialmente hacia vos. Lo que desemboca en que cada acción en la trama, te atraviese de una manera mucho mas cercana. Por otro lado, la construcción de este ambiente acogedor, crea una lectura sumamente adictiva. Uno no quiere de dejar leer este libro.Sin mucho mas que decir, dense el gusto de leerlo. No se van a arrepentir. "

2189,5.0,"Review also on my blog • Twitter • BookstagramThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a story about a famous actress, named Evelyn Hugo, telling her life story to a journalist, named Monique. The intention of this is publishing an authorised biography when Evelyn dies. Evelyn is famous for being an actress, but is also infamous for having seven husbands in her lifetime. The story is mostly Evelyn's, but we do see parts of Monique's life, for the most part being her marriage problems. Most of the story follows Evelyn going through he seven husbands and her career as an actress. Now, don't let the title fool you. This book does appear to be a very heterosexual book from the title. However, it is actually queer as hell! Evelyn is planning to use the biography as a way to talk about her life, how it really was rather than what tabloids portrayed, talk about the real love of her life who was a woman and not a man, and a method to let the world know she's bisexual. Evelyn meets a woman name Celia. They soon start a romance and it is a world wind of one. It will rip your heart out while you route for them and watch them both grow as people. It's a heavy part of the book, as being together openly would be almost impossible, a borderline political statement, as a lot of the book took place in the mid 1900's and they are both actresses. This creates complications and their relationships has high points and low points. One of the husbands of Evelyn, named Harry, was a man she had a strong friendship with, and the relationship was entirely platonic as he was a gay man. They had a daughter together too and I really loved how they were showed to have a fulfilling marriage that was platonic. There are a couple of queer rights topics discussed in the book. Stonewall was an event that was talked about in the book and how Evelyn supported the cause financially. There was also a little discussion arounds the AIDs crisis and how it affected Harry. There was also mention how Evelyn donated to LGBTQIAP+ causes while being closeted. There were other elements to the book too. One being how Evelyn was forced to conform to Eurocentric beauty standards, and Eurocentric standards in general. She's Cuban but she was told she'd have a better career if she dyed her hair blonde, which she did. She also spoke Spanish less, and later almost never did. Her real last name was 'Diaz' but was made to change it to 'Hugo'. There was also an instance she was told Mexican people and Cuban people were '[the] same difference' when she corrected someone after being called Mexican. It portrayed the micro-aggression really well. There were also portrayals of sexism and double standards. Especially how Evelyn having seven husbands and is shamed for that, even in the present time the book takes place. The book was a really intense read at times. It surprises you and makes you fall in love with complex characters. Evelyn is deeply flawed but you still love her. And the same goes for other characters. It was and overall great read. "

2191,5.0,"TJR has done it again...my second 5 star read from her this year, following “Daisy Jones & The Six.” After finishing both books, I immediately wanted to to look these celebrities up; I wanted more. They felt so real and I was very invested in their life stories.You will go into this book thinking that you know what it’s about, but I assure you that you truly have no idea.“Who was the love of Evelyn’s life?”Well, I certainly won’t be telling you, you’ll have to wait for it to unravel from her mouth, just as I did. “The whole nine yards. The good, the bad, and the ugly...I’ll tell you the truth about absolutely everything I’ve ever done.”Evelyn Hugo- A girl who came from nothing, at times her house didn’t even have electric. She is the kind of woman who grabbed life by the balls and worked her own way up; fought for the roles that she wanted, didn’t take crap from anyone. Now, the former “IT” girl who everyone wanted to be is 79 years old. She’s not just another pretty face, she has the talent to back it up, too. All men wanted her, all women wanted to be friends with her. After minding her own business and keeping to herself for quite some time, it is announced that she suddenly wants to go public with a candid “Tell All.”“I need to know that you will listen to EXACTLY what I’m trying to tell you and not place your own assumptions into MY story.”“I was gorgeous, even at fourteen. Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn’t know her power, but I’m sick of all that. I turned heads.” “The world doesn’t GIVE things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me , it should probably be that.”“Word on the street is siren/ LIVING LEGEND/ World’s most beautiful blonde Evelyn Hugo is auctioning off gowns and agreeing to an interview, which she has not done in multiple decades. PLEASE tell me she is finally ready to talk about all of those damn husbands.”- Ernie Diaz- Don Adler- Mick Riva - Rex North- Harry Cameron- Max Girard- Robert Jamison“Heartbreak is loss, divorce is a piece of paper.”Monique- She is the “Chosen One” but why ? Evelyn’s publicist makes is crystal clear that if she isn’t the one to talk to Evelyn, then this celeb won’t do the interview at all. Both Monique and her boss are stunned at this stipulation, because there are clearly better choices—far superior options of journalists at their feet. But, if Monique is what Evelyn wants, it is Monique that she will get. She immediately starts to do her homework, by watching Evelyn’s films and conducting research for three days straight. No matter what she does to study this VIP, no amount of information can prepare her for the road that she is about to be taken down. “I’m asking you if you have the guts to go toe-to-toe with Evelyn Hugo.”“Is Evelyn Hugo going to tell me just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat but never enough to truly reveal anything?”“How silly is it that I thought if I ever found myself in a movie star’s dressing room, that meant I’d have no troubles.”“I was in emerald green again. It was a look that was starting to become my signature.” I found this to be funny because I chose this book for “The Reading Rush 2020 Challenge” to read a book with the cover color of my birthstone: emerald. It was meant to be!An ending that will knock you on your ass!This was incredible and contained subject matter that is SO important! I am so grateful to have read this as a buddy read with Ashley because I NEEDED to discuss!I loved the LGBTQIA+ rep, the diversity in this book; just everything. It was perfection. 5 stars"
2192,1.0,"I just don’t get it? I read as many reviews as I could but nothing about this book makes me feel that it is worth five stars. Evelyn at one point in the book describes herself as “...self involved, so singularly focused, that I rarely took time to think of the people out there like myself.” The words self involved are the only words I would use to describe Evelyn. She had a tough childhood but the book seemed to skip over this and focus on her rise to fame. This book had potential. Her first marriage was upsetting. (view spoiler)[I think it was reality that many face in Hollywood, that needed addressing and I was truly happy when Evelyn decided to leave her first husband. From this point forward the book takes a drastic downward spiral. (hide spoiler)] (view spoiler)[Cecelia, as blunt and cruel as she may be, is too good for Evelyn. I was happy for them in the beginning of their relationship but very quickly self involved Evelyn had to ruin it by sleeping with the most random character. Her and Cecilia kept getting drawn to each other but I just wasn’t invested in this relationship anymore. Maybe I’m a tough critic and a cynic when it comes to a person cheating on you (this is what I believe Evelyn did), but the idea of going back to someone that is toxic is not romantic nor appealing to me. (hide spoiler)] Everything Evelyn did, she did for herself. Evelyn is a strong independent Cuban (view spoiler)[bisexual (hide spoiler)] woman yet she spent majority of the book suppressing these identities. How am I supposed to enjoy reading about a character that constantly describes herself with those traits but is too ashamed about it? Even speaking Spanish for her was too embarrassing and reminded her too much of her childhood. I’m so annoyed with her and so frustrated. She’s so unlikable. She uses her money and her fame and doesn’t give anything back for the majority of the book. (view spoiler)[Suddenly when three people say they should do something for LGBTQ+, she decides to ride the bandwagon and donate? (hide spoiler)] How am I supposed to like reading about a character that only does things to preserve her public image?Harry Cameron deserved so much better. I wish he never (view spoiler)[married Evelyn. I wish he could have had a happy life with John. I wish he never got so upset and drunk drove (which is 100% not okay). My biggest issue was when something wasn’t working Evelyn’s way, the author killed off Harry so that they could get together in Spain the way she wanted to originally. (hide spoiler)] The only redeemable quality of this book was Monique finding her independence and confidence. I want Monique to succeed. I was happy when she (view spoiler)[stood up to David and when she cussed Evelyn out. I would never in a million years forgive a woman who let Harry get off the hook for killing her father. I would want revenge. I would want that man’s reputation to be tanked. I would want Evelyn’s reputation to be ruined. How is it okay for Monique to forgive Evelyn for this? This just seems so unrealistic to me. (hide spoiler)] If it wasn’t evident by my very long and angry review, I hated this book. I don’t understand why there are over 60 people waiting for a copy. I feel like I wasted my time. I wish that I could go back in time and never place a hold on this book in the first place. "

Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.""3. this would make a perfect TV show/ movie I have heard rumours about a possible adaptation for this, and I am totally on board! This book played out almost like a movie in my head, so as long as the production team and cast is good- it would be amazing! Or a TV show with 7 episodes- one for each husband. 4. i wasn't loving this for the first 3oo or so pages. While reading the first part, I was very scared because it just didn't spark that five star feeling for me. I had not even really contemplated the possibility of me not loving this, so it was quite a shock when I didn't fall head over heels in love after the first page. Countless people LOVE this book, and it's not a great feeling to think that you are missing something, or not smart enough to understand some hidden layer everyone else found. I think the hype just got to me.5. i loved the endingDespite my feelings during the first 3 quarters, I ended up giving this 4.5 stars! The ending was STUNNING. It was executed so well, and proved to me that I actually was capable of feeling human emotion. (I was seconds away from crying- and for me that is the equivalent of falling to my knees in agony and posting a black photo on snapchat saying 'My heart is broken. Only the real ones will know')6. harry is the true MVP need I say more? He was just my fav lil' bean and I loved Evelyn and his friendship. 7. unpopular opinion time!I'm not sure if it was because I read Daisy Jones and the Six before this, and went in with too high expectations, but I didn't love this quite as much as I thought I would. I found Daisy Jones to be much more entertaining, quotable and fast paced, but I seem to be a very small majority. Overall, this was a solid 4.5 stars. If I seem a little bitter it's because a combination of the insane hype and DJ&TS led me to believe that this would literally change my life. That didn't happen, but that's okay! I really enjoyed my time reading it, and I am so glad that this exists and other people connected with the story and characters. This is such an important story, and I am so glad it has now been told. I am looking forward to rereading this in the future to see if a second read will change my opinions! "
2194,5.0,"Just realized I never wrote a review of this, but what even is there to say? This book is divine. I've loved every book I've read by Jenkins Reid, but I was blown away by both the expansiveness and intimacy of this one. I'm not sure how she did, but there are a dozen memorable, fully fleshed characters in this, and even while knowing approximately where this was going (there are seven husbands; you know the story won't stop at number six), I couldn't stop reading it. I loved how complex and thorny Evelyn was. I loved that we were expected to love, admire, or feel whatever else for her while really being shown what a thoroughly normal person she is. Not to say she isn't an extraordinary characters, because she is, but to see so deep down into her, to all of her ugliest and most relatable thoughts, to see her humanity on every level--this book is just so rare. I'm sure you've already read it, but if you haven't, do."

""It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.""
Evelyn Hugo is my beautiful complex queen. I felt so many emotions while reading this. I was crying when I finished. There needs to be a movie adaptation immediately and I will watch it 12 times in theater. I wasn't super in love with Monique's character but I did appreciate how her story intersected with Evelyn's."
2196,3.0,"I don't have strong feelings about this book. It had its interesting moments, and it was an enjoyable enough read. But I found the ending to be gimmicky, sort of like the ending of  Daisy Jones and the Six, but at least with that one the book as a whole was more up my alley and had a unique format. I personally didn't connect with the characters in this one so much as I was curious to read about them. Monique's storyline felt underdeveloped, but TJR had to sneak in those chapters for the ending to make sense. Overall, not bad but not up to the hype for me. "
2197,4.0,I loved how easy it was to become immersed in this story and the effortless diversity!
2198,5.0,if u rate this book less than 5 stars you are homophobic i don’t make the rules
2199,4.0,"4.5✨The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a roller coaster. I can’t tell you have many times it made my heart race. The anticipation was practically chocking me, i couldn’t put it down.
The world doesn’t give things, you take things.
We have Evelyn who lost her mother since she was very young and who had an abusive father. Her mother used to always promise her that they would make it to Hollywood; that they would escape from this life. So when her mother passes away, Evelyn sets out to find her way into the heart of Hollywood on her own. Forward many years later. Evelyn has lived a full life and is ready to tell the story of her failures and successes but only to Monique that is an unknown magazine reporter and our second point of you, for a mysterious reason that we find out at the end.
Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.
I both loved and hated Evelyn. I admired her ruthlessness, her complexity, her dedication and her determination to get what she wants. And what she wants she always gets. Evelyn’s character is what made the story feel so real. Like she was a real person. Like I could google her and read all about her movies and successes. There is a lot of ugliness. You get to see the backstage of the Hollywood life. How it is ruthless and dirty and unforgiving and how it beats even its own. Evelyn fought dirty to get what she wanted. She had to sacrifice everything; her body, her identity as a Cuban and bisexual woman. Had to sacrifice her love and her heart because she wanted to show everyone that she could be powerful despite people trying to drag her down and she did. Evelyn made a LOT of mistakes. Most unforgivable. She didn’t make the best decisions. She did what she thought made sense to her but hurt the ones that loved her. In part she thought she was protecting them and herself but she paid a high price for it. But she doesn’t regret what she did because she lived through abuse, failure, heartbreak, money, fame, power, love, family, you name it. At the end, Evelyn redeemed herself. She was accepting of her mistakes; she learned from them. And I think this is one of the best character-driven books out there. 
No one is all good or all bad [...] There’s Evelyn Hugo for you. Somewhere in the middle
The writing was also a huge part of why I love this book. It just flows beautifully and you’ll be reading for hours and never realize it. Also I couldn’t put it down! It’s a quick read and VERY quotable lol. I highlighted so many good stuff!-You see the title and you’ll be like ‘SEVEN HUSBANDS?’ and yes it is but it’s not what it seems. We see the reasons behind all these marriages and how and why they ended. And this story makes us understand that there is more to someone or something that what meets the eye. The men her life degraded her and wanted her only for her success and beauty but never for her true self. The reasons behind her marriages were really interesting. Most of them were for her career as a movie star and it makes you look closer to all celebrity relationships irl. 
I think that loving you has been the truest thing about me.
This book is also a huge lgbtq+ representation. Evelyn is bisexual and she falls in love with a woman. It was by no means an easy relationship. The celebrity lifestyle and all the hiding made things difficult between them. During that time, it was considered the end of the world for someone to be different. So Evelyn had to hide who she was, had to hide her love for this woman and it was so hurtful and made my heart ache because there are still people in the world who are like Evelyn even after all this time. 
I spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.
The character that I loved so much was Harry Cameron which is Evelyn’s first director and her life-long best friend. I wish I could say more about him but it would be a spoiler so just know that I loved him so so much (for the ones who read the book and are reading this part, please hold my hand. thank you) I chucked a half star out of the rating just because I felt that the ending was kind of abrupt. There is a revelation at the end that I think should’ve gotten more time to set and the character should’ve gotten more time to absorb it. 
People think intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth.
I cried so much near the end of the book. I got mad and scared and frustrated and I think that the best thing a book could do is make you feel so much and teach you something. It shows you the ruthlessness of the media, the unforgiving and not-so-glamorous lives of celebrities, what goes on backstage behind all that, the extent to which the world could be cruel but also how none of that matters when you’re surrounded by people who see and love you however you are."
2200,5.0,"5***** all the stars and many more! Right now my mind is a mess over how brilliant this book was so REVIEW TO COME!This was enthralling, exciting, glamorous and addictive. The old Hollywood glamour was utterly compelling. Evelyn Hugo as a character was intriguing and you just want to unlayer her character... like peeling an orange. You are completely enchanted and entranced by her presence on the page.I wish I had a friendship like her and Harry !"
2201,5.0,"To be totally honest with you, I wasn't sure what to expect from this book - I just really loved the cover and every time I saw someone recommend it I kept thinking ""I'm gonna read that because of that cover."" Fast forward to now, and maybe I should start reading beautifully-covered books more often! The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is exactly what it sounds like...okay, maybe not EXACTLY but for the most part it's Evelyn Hugo discussing her 7 (yes, 7) marriages. If that sounds like a lot, you'd be right. If it sounds boring, you could not be more wrong. There are secrets and scandals and manipulations that even a true villain would respect. And boy oh boy did I not see that ending coming. I generally dread the endings of books, not because I don't want them to end but because I feel like at least half the time they're a letdown - all of that build up just to feel like the author didn't know what to do with them. But this book, thank you dear Taylor Jenkins Reid, is one that will forever live on in my short list of perfectly executed endings. What did I think?: Despite having no idea what I was getting into, this not being a book I would normally gravitate toward, and never having been married myself, I couldn't put this book down. Each character was just likable enough and just realistic enough to be endearing, and every moment felt like it was one that could really be lived. All in all, a fantastic telling of a life in the spotlight. Should you read it?: If you enjoy stories of classic Hollywood, thrive off of stories of love gone sour, or just want to get wrapped up in the life of someone far more dramatic than yourself, pick this one up. Not only is it being praised across the internet, but it's one that will be hard to forget once you know what it's all about. "
2202,5.0,"“La gente piensa que la intimidad tiene que ver con el sexo. Pero tiene que ver con la verdad. Cuando te das cuenta de que puedes contarle tu verdad a alguien, cuando puedes mostrarte a alguien, cuando te desnudas delante de alguien y su respuesta es «Conmigo estás a salvo». Eso es intimidad”Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo, es una historia única, escrita con elegancia, absolutamente una lectura atrapaste y conmovedora que cuenta la historia de una famosa actriz de Hollywood que inició su carrera en los años 50' y ahora tiene casi 80 años, quiere que una periodista desconocida llamada Monique escriba su autobiografía para que el mundo conozca la verdadera historia detrás de los sietes matrimonios que tuvo. Me encantó este libro. Me encantó la forma en que estaba escrita, me encantaron los plots twist, me encantó la historia dentro de la historia, me encantaron y los personajes, el escenario, el glamour de Hollywood en los 50', me encanto el hecho de que este libro me hiciera creer que el personaje era real... y ame a Evelyn Hugo, ella hizo su imperio, se creó a sí misma, hizo todo lo que pudo para llegar a la cima, ella hizo todo lo necesario para lograr las fama y la vida que anhelaba.Totalmente recomendado."
2203,5.0,I am fucking deceased and will not be available for comment until further notice.
2204,3.0,"What an addicting, spectacular and all round breathtaking book. I get that giving 3 stars to a book with an opening line for a review like that is kind of weird and honestly even now I’m not sure what to rate this book. This is my first TJR book and it might be my last?  I’m not sure. Because while I loved this book, I’m not even sure it’s my style. This journey was so exciting that I’m itching to pick up another book by her and if I do I’m pretty sure it’ll be daisy jones & the six but I feel like that’s just from my “reading high” I flew through this in 1 and a half days. I couldn’t put it down and I got so invested in the story. I went into it completely blind only knowing that Evelyn Hugo had had 7 husbands. But going into it, I imagined a world where gossip girl was real and we get a biography by Blair Waldorf about how she manipulates and schemes and only cares about herself in the end. 
“I’m bisexual. Don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box, Monique. Don’t do that.”
The writing was flawless and it really worked for me. I didn’t have any trouble of having to adjust to the author and the plot and story and characters were amazing. Reading about the lengths a women of that era had to go through to get to where she is, was an eye opening experience. “
 You do it because you know he’ll like it. Because he’s given you everything you came for. You should give him everything he came for.He ducks and frowns at you, as if you’re a small deer he has to leave in the forest.You start crying.And then he’s gone.And you stop.And you think, If only they gave out Oscars for this shit.”
And literally being able to watch the events unfold through the pages is something that many authors cannot do for me. Evelyn’s reasons for her marriage to each husband was ,at that moment, fair and real. Her life with each men was a different read for me. 
“No, of course not,” Evelyn says kindly. “If you did, at your age, you’d be a cynic.”“But at your age?” I ask.“With my experience? A realist.”“That, in and of itself, is awfully cynical, don’t you think? Divorce is loss.”Evelyn shakes her head. “Heartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”
I admired her explanations for everything. It was interesting listening to her manipulate us into believing everything she did was necessary. Her reasoning and her truths 
“First, you have to push people’s boundaries and not feel bad about it. No one is going to give you anything if you don’t ask for it. You tried. You were told no. Get over it.”“And the second thing?”“When you use people, be good at it.”
I loved Harry. So much. I mean who wouldn’t really? He was just the perfect man out there and of course he was gay because the best of them are always gay. I cried when he died and I cried a little more when I flipped the page and yup, he died. With that being said, that was the only portion of the book I actually connected with and that’s probably because i actually cared about Harry. Which is something that I cannot say for Evelyn Hugo.  i respected her as a character and what she had to go through but I did not connect with her nor did I really care. I, just like Monique Grant, had a complicated love-hate relationship with Evelyn. And while Monique was fine with forgiving her, I’m not so gracious. I’m a petty bitch and I wanted to burn the book when I found out what Evelyn did. Moving on to Evelyn’s relationship with Celia : I did not buy it. I did not believe in their “love”. I don’t know why, but their so called love story did not hold my attention and frankly, I would’ve found it more believable if Harry turned straight and fell in love with Evelyn. What can I say? I love love. But I felt like Evelyn and Celia’s love was very close to toxic and meh. I got bored of them. But two women in the worlds spotlight falling in love with each other at that time and era ; I can see why Evelyn had to make the choices that she did but it just made me doubt their relationship more. 
“And I certainly don’t want to love a woman who would screw some singer just so the world doesn’t suspect she loves me.”
But 
overall.
 It was so much fun reading this and going through the plot twists and so called heartbreaks and watching almost everyone die in the last 100 pages did amazing work on my mental health."
2205,2.0,"2.5 stars.I could start this review by saying that this book didn't work for me because adult contemporary fiction just isn't my thing. I could say that this wasn't my kind of novel, since it deals with American history and Hollywood and I care about neither. I could tell you that the hype ruined it for me, the glowing five-star reviews, or the many untagged spoilers.All of those things are true. But the main reason is, I don't like reading books about queer pain.Yes, that's it. I get enough in real life. I'm glad if someone can feel empowered by a book about people suffering for being queer, some of them dying tragically when relatively young because the author likes to toe the line with tragedy porn, but I can't.Why I think The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is about queer pain:The surprising thing is, this book wouldn't have felt like that if only it had been told differently, but at the same time I can recognize this wasn't possible.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo follows Monique, a young reporter who is now writing the biography of the very mysterious actress Evelyn Hugo, famous for her seven husbands. This books covers all of Evelyn's life, which means that:• it's very fast-paced and readable, but it's also rushed;• the side characters are never developed enough;• I couldn't care about anyone but Evelyn;• I couldn't understand why Evelyn and the love of her life liked each other so muchI couldn't, because everything goes by way too fast. Almost all scenes we get of Celia and Evelyn are the plot-relevant ones, the bones of the story, which means that most of the scenes we get about them are about them fighting. And I don't mean bickering, I mean hurting each other, sometimes deliberately. I'm sure their relationship wasn't all like that, but if that is all I get, I don't have any reason to root for them. We see the conflict instead of the relationship.And all the conflict in their relationship stems from homophobia.You could say that it actually stems from Evelyn being selfish and always using people, you could say that all of it happened because of Celia's stubbornness (by the way: I couldn't stand her), but honestly? The reason Evelyn was using people was to protect herself and her love from homophobia. Celia was stubborn because she didn't know how to make this marriage work when everyone outside her found family was homophobic. Once we meet Celia, everything was about homophobia.I'm not saying books like this one shouldn't exist. I know The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo has been important for many people. I also know that I almost couldn't finish it, and I still wonder how this book managed to hurt me so much when I knew everything that was going to happen and didn't even care about the characters. I don't think this is a bad book, either: Evelyn is a very unique, well-rounded character, surprisingly complex, so manipulative she almost scared me. I really liked her, because she was awful at times, and I love when women - especially queer women of color (she's bisexual and Cuban) - are allowed to be awful without being demonized. And while I think this format of storytelling is inherently flawed, I don't think this book could have worked any other way.This book just wasn't for me. There's nothing wrong with that; I just wish I had realized this before putting myself through the second half."
2206,3.0,"I have read a very very very hyped book and I survived.I do think it was worth the hype, I thought some things were done brilliantly but I also thought other things were done poorly. I do get why its hyped and even though my rating is quite average I still think it is a good book.Things I liked:☆ The character development was done very well and was shown very clearly especially Eveyln's character growth.☆ The aesthetic and vibe of the book was very pretty and gave a since of it's time era.☆ I liked Evelyn, it's is very important for me to like the protagonist although she was very flawed and did things I wouldn't necessarily agree about or do.☆ In general the characters were well written and felt real some of my favourite are Harry Cameron and Rex North.☆ I didn't get bored, I thought considering I was reading a life story that I would get bored but instead I was very intrigued and excited for the next part to come.☆ The writing was good and easy to read.☆ The plot twist was very well done and unpredictable.( The next part has minor spoilers)Things I didn't like: ☆ I thought Evelyn's and Celia's romance was insta-love which I don't personally enjoy.☆ I didn't like Celia much and she had a big part in the book.☆ At the beginning of the book they say that Harry and Connor die a quiet tragic death so when Harry died I wasn't really surprised. That mention at the beginning took away a huge part of the surprise and the sadness that I could have went through.☆ The part were Evelyn was about 45+ wasn't as good as her in her twenties and thirties.☆ The way Evelyn died made me uncomfortable and it feels quite problematic in my opinion.Overall, it was a good/solid book and I enjoyed it. Also I would make sure to read the trigger warnings before reading the book because it has a lot."
2207,5.0,"Is Evelyn Hugo going to tell me just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat but never enough to truly reveal anything?Wow! I just started working at a new school and when I mentioned at a staff meeting yesterday that reading was my hobby, one of my new co-workers said she went home and grabbed her last two great reads to share with me. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was one of the two. Now if anyone has been in contact with a teacher at the beginning of the school year, you know we're crazy tired getting back into our routine and we have almost no time to commit to pleasure reading, but this book, once started is so hard to put down.  Each of Evelyn 's husbands are given their due as the Hollywood starlet retells her story to an up and coming journalist, Monique Grant, but not for an article as the latter believes. Rather, Evelyn Hugo wants Monique to write her memoirs, a tell-all, in which she plans to reveal the greatest love of her life. But Monique wonders exactly what prompted the actress to speak now and where she fits into this puzzle. Dear Goodreaders, this book is definitely one of the best books of 2017, without a doubt. I know those are dangerous words to use, but I felt this was one of the  most mesmerizing tales that I have read in awhile. I literally couldn't leave this book and carried it everywhere. Thank goodness I did my laundry and tidied up my home before beginning to read because so far this has been a very unproductive Saturday morning. Give it a try! I don't think you'll be disappointed."
2208,5.0,"I’m just coming out and say it here and now – this book deserves ALL the stars.Not only because of Evelyn Hugo herself, but also because of the story, the plotting, and all the emotions it evoked in me. It’s with one word a MASTERPIECE!!!I don’t think it’s necessary for me to talk about the inner workings of this book. Just let me tell you, that Evelyn Hugo is one of the most intriguing and fascinating characters I’ve read this year.Strong, ruthless, beautiful, and loving. She deserved an Oscar for her performance.Her life was incredibly fascinating. And each husband brought her closer to her ultimate goal.I honestly didn’t know what the book was about when I picked it up. I had no idea where it was going, and that alone, this uniquely different portrait of a Hollywood bombshell, made this book so much more unforgettable.It was emotional, heart-breaking at times, touching, and never less than amazing.I know that I’ll be reading everything this author is releasing from here on out. I’m hooked. Two 5 star books in one year by the same author is all the proof I need.BRAVO!!!___________________________________Find more reviews and book recommendations on my blog.Find me on Bookstagram."

“Show me the real you, then, and I'll make sure the world understands.”
I might just update this with my favorite quotes because it makes me feel things.------------i just need to say that i realized how my review of this book does not even begin to encompass my love for this book and i really could not string the right words together for a better review even after a year. but i don't care just look at the shelves that i have this book on and you will know my feelings.------------
“You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until somewhat stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”
now... THAT... was a good bookThere are too many words and at the same time too little. The only important thing that you need to know about my reading experience in this book is that...I LOVED IT AND I THINK YOU SHOULD READ IT (DOESNT MATTER WHO YOU ARE.. BECAUSE YOU SHOULD)FUN STORY: I was just suppose to read this for a book club and had no intention whatsoever to like it, I just needed to know the story. But the universe has its ways..."

2211,4.0,"I don't know who need to hear this but hey do you realize that it's been a decade since you've added this book to your tbr? Enough of calling friends out. Now give me the privilege to start off by saying that, 
The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo
 is not what you are expecting it to be.How dare I say this! I don't know you or your cat, and I can not possibly know what you are expecting from this book or any book for that matter, right? Right. I'm aware this is a bold claim but I hope it makes you consider reading this book sooner. After all, this book is so insanely praised for some good reason and some of you should know who this Evelyn Hugo really is. I had always wondered why the book community worships Hugo, now I know. I mean, read this- 
 “I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.”
 I dived into this book half-blindly. I knew this book is about Evelyn Hugo, some Hollywood celebrity . I did take the information about Hugo having seven husbands with a eye roll. The only review for this book which I read did spoil me about a certain representation -Thanks. I didn’t ask. I knew there was a big revelation ; why Hugo chose the narrator specifically to write her biography. I knew there was some auction involved. I was forewarned by some good souls to have some tissues ready.And friends, you'd be thrilled to know that it turned out, I knew nothing. This book is everything  but what I was expecting it to be. I mentioned everything I knew about this book before reading it. But what I didn’t know was, this is a book which tells a story and that's the only thing that matters. For such a book with all sorts of twisted humans and ugly truths, this book did an exceptional job to become one of the most beautiful stories I've listened to. This book is nothing if not a beautifully crafted, twisted, engrossing, character driven tale about a women, about the great loves of her life, and most importantly about love to me. I couldn’t put it down, I devoured the story, I couldn’t wait to reach the ending but was terribly hungry to know more, to dive deeper when I finally finished it. While reading this, I kept asking myself - Why Monique?  I was so very desperate, I actually tried to do some basic calculation to see if somehow they were related by blood. The Seven Quotes By Evelyn Hugo:  
•“Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.”• “Make them pay you what they would pay a white man.”•“Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box. Don't do that.”•“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”•When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things.”•“You wonder what it must be like to be a man, to be so confident that the final say is yours.”•“No one is just a victim or a victor. Everyone is somewhere in between. People who go around casting themselves as one or the other are not only kidding themselves, but they’re also painfully unoriginal.”
 An Icon, Indeed.  I loved Evelyn Hugo but I also hated Evelyn Hugo. Most of all, I craved for more of her story, her perfect imperfection, and everything in between. The writing made me sense  Taylor Jenkins Reid becoming one of my favourite narrator in near future. Trust me when I say, the writing is absolutely beautiful, and this was one of the most readable books I ever read. Is this book perfect? No. Did I need for this book to be perfect? Well, no. I can't wait to hear more stories from Reid! Honestly, like most books this book is imperfect. I was in fact disappointed (that's why a star is missing) by the time I reached the ending although I loved the ending. It pains me to not have known why I felt so.. empty after finishing this, why I was so disappointed , what was I expecting etc. The revelation didn’t do anything to me, nor did I shed a single drop of tears. Personally, this is not a book I can relate to, this is not a book which feels like home, this book does not have the most lovable characters, and it barely had anything that sent me the open invitation to love it. But I did love it, and that is it. I'm beginning to understand, love is all that matters, at the end of the day. “Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it."" Overall: The bad guy aka hype didn't lie this time. This is how you narrate a book, folks. -------[4:03 Am] Maybe I can finally get some sleep. Review to come, I guess. "

2213,5.0,"“. . . you can’t tell a single thing about a person’s true character if you both want the same thing.” When I think about why I love reading fiction novels, a book like The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo comes around and reminds me of the magic— being able to put yourself into another person’s shoes, and live out a life entirely different from your own. To visit new places, experience adventures, learn from their mistakes, and let those pieces play a small part in shaping the way you navigate your own life. This book tells the life story of Evelyn Hugo, a story of glamour, betrayal, vanity, love, soul mates (that come in many different forms) and, yes, 7 husbands. I had heard so much hype about this book, and Taylor Jenkins Reid in general, and it didn’t take me long to understand the adoration people have for this book. It truly played out like a movie in my head, and was to blame for some not-so-cute tears at the end. I had such a good time deep diving into this complicated, unapologetic woman.“No one is a victim or a victor. Everyone is somewhere in between. People who go around casting themselves as one or the other are not only kidding themselves, but they’re also painfully unoriginal.”"

""But I like you this way. I like you impure and scrappy and formidable.I like the Evelyn Hugo who sees the world for what it is and then goes out there and wrestles what she wants out of it.""
When I searched up the title of this book, one of the suggested searches were""Is The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo based on a true story?""
& I cannot stress enough, how accurately that encapsulates my feelings for this book.I can't relate to international sexpot sensation, Evelyn Hugo, but this book has such a strong sense of real-life influence that I can't help but say it again, how is this not real? After reading this, I truly expected to see Evelyn Hugo laughing & smiling alongside Marilyn Monroe when I search up pictures of New Hollywood.I inhaled this book. I essentially read it in one day. Taylor Jenkins Reid's writing is so final & imperative, it leaves leaves no room for questions or doubt. Everything from intentions to results are laid bare & I consumed it all. If you're thinking of reading it, leave NOW. This book is best when gone into blind.⚠️ Heavy spoilers ahead ⚠️ 
THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO : A CASE STUDY 
Evelyn Hugo. Sharp tongued, quick witted & ruthless in all the realest ways. I don't think there are many readers that can relate to Evelyn's super-stardom but we've all had times where we've made selfish choices that are less than moral. We're not proud of it, but if we had to do it again, we would. There are times where we wished we had the courage to make the ""wrong"" choice, to follow our hearts, but our heads win anyway.Evelyn represents that courage. That courage to do whatever it takes. To be even more relentless & unyielding than pain itself.While Evelyn could be seen as a slut, a whore, cruel, greedy & all the labels society would like to slam on her to stop her from putting herself first, she never relented. She represents to me the power women stand to have if we stopped letting society dictate what we should or shouldn't do. Evelyn Hugo fucked her way to the top & she made all the men look like fools.Never once, did she let society reduce her self-worth to her sexual life. She lived life on her own terms. That was very empowering. For someone who grew up in an Asian household, where women were taught to cater to men, to never desire money, power or independence, it was an honour to read of Evelyn Hugo & her fight to the top. It was empowering in more ways than one & I will carry it with me for the rest of my life. Yes, she used people & she hurt them. She would not hesitate to throw them under the bus for her own gain. But she never denied that. She never acted like she was better than.The premise of this book is like nothing I've ever read before. It's so unique & out of the ordinary, I would have been caught off-guard by how good it is had it not been so hyped. This is what writers are capable of. It truly left me in awe. This is why I read. This is where it's at.Evelyn's struggle with hiding her bisexuality was extremely intriguing to read about. While the Stonewall riots or the social repercussions of the AIDS pandemic were not spotlighted, the lengths to which Evelyn had to hide her relationship was painful to read. It was exhausting that while Evelyn had all that was luxurious & extravagant, she was barricaded from a simple thing such as love. People who were as kind as Harry would risk getting his child getting taken away simply because he was queer.When Celia passed away in the end & all Evelyn could think about was how much time they had lost, it reminded me of this song;'If They Only Knew' by Alfie Arcuri
If they only knewHow to keep you safe like I kept youHow to speak the words they've never usedI wish they only knewIf they only sawThe way my lips would shake when they met yoursThe way your heart was met with open doorsI wish they only sawThey've never ever had the strengthTo feel the weight in what we meantIf they only knewOur love is just another shade of blue 
If they only knew what an all-consuming love Celia & Evelyn shared, they wouldn't have had so much wasted time. It truly broke my heart into a thousand pieces. There's a lot of critique surrounding Monique's part but I loved it. And here's why :Monique represents us, readers. While she has her little plotline weaved into the book, her questions, her prompts represents what we were thinking as we read.It gives the reader such a strong foothold in the story & a solid perspective. It makes the writing biased & unbiased at the same time.While it's told from Evelyn's first POV, we've also implicitly established our position as a journalist, someone who is indifferent & objective. This distinction makes Evelyn Hugo become so much more legitimate & factual. Monique's perspective was also written in the present tense contrasting with the past tense when reading from Evelyn's perspective. This distinction is important in juxtaposing the moods & atmosphere. Every time it switched to Monique's perspective, it was like I was sucked through an imaginary vortex & plopped back into the present. I swear I can almost hear the SCHHWOOOP! sound of me being transported through time.TJR also used the second POV multiple times throughout this book. This is a literary device not many authors use but TJR nailed it. By using the 2nd POV when doing such a despicable thing like seducing Mick Riva into eloping with her, she addresses the reader directly. Everything suddenly feels imperative & all-important. You must-, you need to-, you can only-. It makes us feel like we're being commanded & that we have no choice, as she is simply doing as she was told. Indirectly, you start to understand her. While her actions are unjust & despicable, you feel like you have no choice, just like her. You do this, you do that. It detaches any sort of emotion from the scene & it plays out like a series of carefully orchestrated dance steps. I have a million other interpretations to this use of the second POV alone...this book needs to be studied in classrooms.Getting into the husbands, only Harry warrants any mention. I am extremely sad that Harry met that kind of end. He deserved better but then again, life isn't a wish-granting factory. Harry was an amazing partner, father & friend. I truly loved him as much as Evelyn did & I did not doubt for a moment that they were soulmates. The four of them, John, Celia, Harry & Evelyn will forever be in my heart. The way they loved. It was dramatic, fierce & all at once. I was in love with their love. This book made me realise how important some distinctions in life were. Failure & heartbreak. Sex & intimacy. Apologetic & regretful. All polar opposites. The fact that she had breast cancer chilled me to the bone. The thing that catapulted her to the top would also be her demise. Even in death, Evelyn Hugo is poetic. When Monique realises Evelyn is going to kill herself, my heart literally stopped. I never had so many emotions rush through me at the same time. It's hard to articulate. Her last look as she posed on the balcony, taken literal hours before her death will haunt me for days. Up till her last breath, she was a star. Marilyn Monroe who? /j Evelyn Hugo may have a million sins to her name. She may be apologetic about them or not. She may be everything but she is never regretful. But perhaps, her biggest regret of all is Celia St. James. This is something I will never get over.Let me end this review by paraphrasing what TJR wrote to her daughter in the acknowledgements, to you.Evelyn would tell you, ""Go out there, be kind and grab what you want out of the world with both hands."" Well, she might not put as big an emphasis on being kind but as your friend, I must insist. "

""People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.""
Let us all spare a moment and admire Reid's beautiful writing style. It’s so engaging, it has you believing it so much you forget that Evelyn Hugo is a fictional character.Evelyn Hugo purposefully states that she wants to tell her whole story, no holds barred, free for people to judge critically. She warns that she has done some deeds she’s not particularly proud of, which may make her unlikeable in some eyes. It’s true – she’s not a saint, Evelyn Hugo is a very complex character with some distinct flaws. Do i agree with everything she had done? No. But she's very nuanced, even in her ‘own’ telling and it’s hard to come out of the novel not liking her. She did everything she could have to get what she needed, to protect the people she genuinely loved and for that you have got to respect her.To say that this is a novel about a woman who got married seven times, it’s surprising that it doesn’t get repetitive at all. Each husband has a different personality and each marriage has different circumstances, and I was absolutely and definitely interested in every single one of them(except for Max maybe). The book is 382 pages long but I think it could easily have been expanded to give us some more detail. It seems to fly past and I’d have loved to read more, although I suppose that’s just a marker of how much I enjoyed it.I’ve seen reviews that comment that this book reads like chick-lit. It doesn’t; not at all. The ‘real’ parts of the novel are fascinating and really draws the reader into to the topsy-turvy life of this woman in the glamorous 1950s. Highly recommend."

“The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.”
I devoured this book with the avid interest of a Taylor Swift fan scouring Buzzfeed for articles about their goddess. Even at 400 pages, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is punchy and immensely readable. Readers who come in expecting a scandalous thriller will be surprised at the amount and depth of social issues explored in this book. Evelyn is a Cuban (view spoiler)[bisexual (hide spoiler)] woman who wants to make it in Hollywood. Set in the 1950s, we see the film industry in all its glitzy cruelty and discrimination (Some things never change, do they?). LGBTQIA issues are a huge focal point too and it's handled with the utmost respect. Special shout-out to the rivalry between Evelyn and Ruby. They're competitors in the show biz and even though Evelyn respects her and likes her as a person, she's not willing to give up that top spot. As much as I love tight female friendships, it's important that other relationships are shown too. Ones built on disagreement yet mutual respect.We don’t get much insight into what happened to Evelyn’s individual husbands after the divorce. But it feels right. No matter what the title says, this is Evelyn Hugo’s story and she's not giving up her voice."

Evelyn Hugo is the type of character I'd like to read more about. Her ultimate goal was to be popular. To be seen. To be someone. She had a goal and she would do anything to reach it. So she went after it and she made it.And now she's here to admit everything she had to do. With grace, brutal honesty and no shame.

And the final twist was so obvious and dull. I don't understand the hype; her life was indeed interesting and glamorous, but we so often find ourselves praising storytellers when in fact we just need some good hecking

I mean, what else was I expecting from Evelyn Hugo. Former Hollywood Starlet of the 50s who has lived her life in the public eye but is brimming with secrets and is ready to tell all..I loved Evelyn. I rooted for her. I supported her decisions 100% and thought it was absolutely boss of her to own them till the end and have close to no regrets about most of them. That's the definition of a baddass!!! Evelyn wasn't afraid to lie or play dirty, whether it hurt you or not, as long as it served her purpose I usually hate such characters. The selfish self serving ones but with Evelyn I loved her because of it. Top tier! Hail Miss Hugo!"

2230,5.0,"Antes de comenzar con la reseña per se, quiero hacer un pequeño disclaimer.Yo, por regla general, suelo ser muy recelosa de los libros abismalmente populares (tienen una detestable inclinación a decepcionarme). Leyendo best-sellers he encontrado de todo: personajes pobremente construidos, romantización de relaciones tóxicas, una trama mal desarrollada, actitudes reprochables justificadas como ""actos de rebeldía"", una escritura comparable con la de unx niñx de primaria, etcétera, etcétera. Todo esto, claro, promocionado por amigxs, colegas y personas cuyas reseñas sigo como «la novela del año» o «su nuevo libro favorito». Yikes.No fui indiferente a la tendencia que adquirió Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo de aparecer constantemente en mi feed de GoodReads. Cualquier día random que decidiera darme una vuelta por mi inicio para ver las actualizaciones de mis amigxs, bum, ahí la encontraba: o alguien a la añadía a sus futuras lecturas, o dejaban un comentario relacionado a una escena en particular, o bien una review.La ignoré durante mucho (de verdad, mucho) tiempo antes de decidir darle una oportunidad. Grandes decisiones sí las hay.En palabras simples, Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo me pareció un libro excelente.La escritura de Taylor Jenkins Reid me resultó muy delicada y fluida, desde el principio me sentí atrapada e intrigada por la historia y con ganas de saber más, más, más. Es un libro de lectura sencilla, muy ágil y que utiliza un vocabulario muy informal y moderno que no escatima en groserías; creo que esto último contribuyó a esa sensación de realidad y naturalidad que me dejó, después de todo, todxs decimos alguna palabrota de vez en cuando.Realmente no podía dejar de leer, y si no hubiera tenido que ir a trabajar 9hs diarias seguramente me lo habría terminado el mismo día que lo empecé.En cuanto al contenido de la historia, los personajes son espectaculares.Están tan bien construidos que te producen esa sensación de amor-odio: un rato los amás, luego hacen algo reprochable y los odiás, y después los volvés a amar. Son complejos, con altibajos, prioridades y personalidades muy distintas entre sí. Es un placer conocer en profundidad personajes (¿personas?) tan desarrollados. Salvo, quizá, Monique...Si pasamos a la trama, lo más importante –y lo que agradezco infinitamente– son los temas sobre las problemáticas sociales. No puedo explicitarlas a fuerza de no soltar spoilers, pero sepan que no son asuntos menores y que fueron manipulados y resueltos maravillosamente.Pero acá quiero hacer un stop.No puedo no mencionar que este libro está, definitivamente, orientado a un público de adolescentes o de adultxs jóvenes; con esto quiero decir que los temas de interés social que relatan no están desarrollados en profundidad, solo cuentan con información pertinente para comprender el contexto, las consecuencias y por qué es tan importante actuar al respecto. Si se lee con mentalidad de adultx que conoce información de sobra al respecto, puede resultarle insatisfactorio; si, en cambio, se lo lee con mentalidad de adolescente que comienza a enterarse/informarse de estas cosas, creo que lo va a ver como un gran primer acercamiento y, por qué no, quizá hasta como incentivo para buscar información por otros lados. No voy a ser muy exigente en este punto porque, de cualquier forma, siento que todo se manejó muy bien.Volviendo al tema, la trama es atrapante e, inesperadamente, intensa. Hay un plot twist al final que, uff... ni les cuento. Me quedé boquiabierta.Creo que Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo una opción excelente para lectura ligera. A pesar de sus casi cuatrocientas páginas, la longitud apeeenas se siente, ya que se lee rapidísimo y, como anticipé, utiliza un vocabulario sencillo y nada rebuscado. Yo, la verdad, quedé muy sorprendida con esta novela.Nunca me imaginé que me resultaría tan entretenida una historia biográfica sobre un personaje ficticio (y, lo que es más, que un libro juvenil tan ampliamente celebrado me acabaría realmente fascinando). Esta lectura me tomó por sorpresa hasta a mí misma. Recomendado es poco."
2231,3.0,"Engaging and fast, with a cathartic and twisty end tying everything together. I liked reading about Evelyn getting ahead in the world and being unapologetic about it, but the sappy ""family trumps all fame and fortune"" felt a bit thin in the endYou can decide wealth and renown are worthless if you have themBoy this would be a nice mini-series on a streaming service, fully utilising the screen media to bring The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo to life!Charisma is charm that inspires devotion is said quite early in the book, and Taylor Jenkins Reid does a very good job of portraying Evelyn Hugo, Hollywood star looking back on her life, in a way that the reader can root for her, while also seeing her ambition and callousness to get to stardom.Monique is an interviewer send to the now old star, and we are left guessing to the reason that Evelyn would want to reveal her life story to Monique, adding to the propulsion of this faux biography.Evelyn is dashingly gorgeous and soon manages to escape her abusive environment, and with some calculation and kind of mutual beneficial using of people gets to fame.Being wanted meant having to satisfy, and despite some Disney like ideas of love the pattern of violence is repeated with some of her husbands, an unequal currency to the paparazzi coverage a marriage brings her. Along the way she meets rivals and friends, and at a third of the book the LGBT angle becomes apparent. Sometimes I did wonder what the attraction of Evelyn is to her surroundings besides beauty and ruthless intent (which she herself acknowledges as well: What did I have to be good at besides being beautiful?), she seems to get bored with people around her quite soon and remains rather calculating against all but her most intimate friends.Were all whores really in some way or another, at least in Hollywood her best friend Harry mentions, and reading the story this definitely doesn't seems much of a stretch.So I am a pawn. Everyone is a pawn is a more cynical version, but does lead to wild success, even after some ups- and downs driven by disparate sexist standards between men and women.Monique in the current timeline is rather tame, and seemingly apologizing ever other dialogue with the moviestar. We can’t go around treating people as dogshit and then expect to be forgiven Evelyn notes on one of her husbands, but in the end this is a rather ironic statement.Even fame, fortune, beauty and wealth doesn't transcend some societal norms or aging and sickness, which in the end give the last years of Evelyn a bit of a soap opera like quality.The end is very cathartic, tying everything neatly together at the end despite insisting on moral ambiguity. It mellows out Evelyn maybe a bit too much for my taste, still this is a fast and entertaining read with one very interesting main character.As she herself says: It’s not all luck, it’s luck and being a son of a bitch, and I did enjoy this page-turner despite some sappy overtones near the end."
2232,3.0,"I’ve previously read ‘Daisy Jones and the Six’ by TJR and remember being sadly underwhelmed by it. It started strongly but ultimately I found it lacking in emotion. So it was with some trepidation that I started reading ‘The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo’. But I am pleased to say that I enjoyed this book a lot more. I think one of the great differences between the two books for me was actually nothing to do with either book, but more to do with my preconceptions. These books are what I would term popcorn reads. You read them as fast as you can almost getting a sugar rush and then they quickly fade from memory once the book is over. Which I think is why I’m finding it difficult to pin down exactly what I want to say in this review. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is an intoxicating read. It comes at you hard and fast, and spits you out at the end like you’ve been on the best rollercoaster ride of your life. It’s written in an extremely accessible fashion and continuously teases the reader with delightfully salacious nuggets of old Hollywood glitz and glam until the very end. The book is about an ageing Hollywood icon named Evelyn Hugo who grants a young up and coming writer, Monique, an interview which turns into the *E! True Hollywood Story* of Evelyn’s life and times. As is evident from the book’s title Evelyn has been married on seven occasions and the story reveals the reality behind these marriages and the truth about just who was the love of Evelyn’s life. And what I found incredibly fascinating was the theme of consent and sexual agency for women, and using one’s body as a commodity to fight against patriarchal ideologies. Evelyn was described as a sex-bomb style icon and some of the best parts of the book was when Evelyn discussed how she both felt about and somewhat orchestrated this. The book to me at times called to mind the modern classic Valley of the Dolls (Jacqueline Susann) in how it portrayed the plight of women in a male dominated Hollywood. But while the flashback narrative of this book was incredibly compelling I feel the modern day storyline focusing on interviewer Monique was much less interesting and a lot weaker. To me Monique felt more akin to a convenient plot device rather than an authentic character. Her role was much too passenger-like and because of that the developments at the book’s climax did not have the gravitas it should have had I felt. I also felt much of the writing style was extremely cliched and the plot twists somewhat unoriginal. Yes the book was quick and punchy, but to me it lacked emotional depth. Don’t get me wrong, I really did enjoy reading about Evelyn’s incredible life story but due to TJR’s narrative choices as a character her thought processes were always kept just out of reach of the reader and therefore she felt too stylised rather than deeply authentic to me. I felt a lot of the plot developments were hackneyed and in many ways too calculated. There was a sterility to the writing in my opinion and I craved more glimpses of the complexity of human emotion underneath the Evelyn Hugo persona than we were given. This book is akin to candy floss (cotton candy); it’s incredibly sweet and super delicious but once you think you’re properly tasting it it disappears in an instant. I had similar issues when I read Daisy Jones and the Six so it could just be a case of me not being the right kind of reader for these books. However, I did have a lot of fun reading this book. It kept my attention the whole way through, I enjoyed the peppiness of the pacing, and liked the commentary on female sexuality and the male gaze. Recommended to someone who wants a quick and easy read with a little sprinkling of old Hollywood glamour. 3.5 stars *An e-copy of this book was kindly provided to me by the publisher, Simon and Schuster, via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*

2233,4.0,"I'm waffling between a 4.25-4.5* rating, it was a fun read but didn't knock my socks off for the 5I can add very little to all the praise this book has received. It is a wonderfully crafted tale intertwining two different characters whose lives intersect to share a story; how ones life directly influences the other both positively and potentially negatively was a fun hook in. I think saying much more than that risks ruining the book.However I can't seem to shut up and have a few more thoughts to share. 🙈This book was an imaginative insight into what could have been someone's life. It is so richly described that I kept having to restrain myself from googling the people/films/award ceremony outfits and scandals surrounding this enigmatic character. We should keep in mind that Evelyn is far from likeable. She is real, she makes poor choices and bad decisions for the right/wrong reasons. She is driven and you can't help but admire and root for her even if you don't like how she goes about things. She is unflinching and unapologetic for the life choices she has made and that in and of itself is admirable. She has always known what she is and what she is willing to do to get where she wants to be.Monique is our modern day link to Evelyn and going through her own life/work/love crisis while documenting the starlets story which in turn has a knock on effect on Moniques life choices. There is an undercurrent of mystery surrounding Evelyn's choice of Monique to write her story and those connections were interestingly handled and a one-two combination punch straight to the feels as they were revealed and interwoven into the narrative - masterfully hinted at and fulfilled.Harry is a gem and easily my favourite character. How I wish he could have been real although I'm sure he had his own troubles and we only see him through Evelyn's tinted glasses, but from his intro through his ""Rise and shine, little bird"", I wanted nothing but the best for him!I surprised myself by enjoying the mixed media articles and blog posts that spearhead some chapters and give us a sneaky peek into the stories surrounding Evelyn's life & act as an interesting counterballast to the story she shares with Monique.Unrelated but last year I fell down a YouTube rabbit hole of watching biography channel documentaries. Elizabeth Taylor, Debbie Reynolds, Judy Garland, Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Jackie O etc all the glamazons from the Hollywood hey-day. This book really reminded me of them and makes me curious as to whether (m)any of these starlets lives influenced this story. 🤔If somehow like me you have not yet read this book, do yourself a favour & pick it up. It is an interesting look at someone's life through decades in the spotlight, the choices and decisions they made to get there & stay there + how it affected those around them and their view of the world from inside a bubble so few glimpse."

""It's always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless whiles serving themselves ruthlessly.""

 Evelyn Hugo is a cunning self serving btch and she's unapologetically aware of that fact. I LOVE HER.This was oddly enthralling and nostalgic especially when you listen to the audiobook! Evelyn Hugo's fictional life story is just as fascinating as real celebrities are. It's utterly hypnotizing and to say that this is just mainly about Hugo's seven husbands is definitely an understatement. This was heavy and funny and just so fckin perfectly heartwarming. I cried a lot while reading this and I can definitely see myself rereading this in the near future!------------------------------------------------------------------------PROBABLY THE BEST BOOK THAT I'VE READ THIS YEAR. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH RTC WHEN ALL MY TEARS DRY UP."
2235,2.0,"There's no doubt that Reid is a talented writer; her prose is powerful and keeps the reader engaged throughout. Parts of the storyline, however, come across as preachy about LGB relationships. The main character doesn't care who she lies to, cheats on, hurts, or even covers up a murder for, if it means ""being true to herself"". It is fast-paced with interesting characters, and the details from old Hollywood make Evelyn seem like she could be a real person. It's worth a read if one can sift through the heavy-handed contrived plot and some very detailed sexual exploits to find the core story. Let me be clear here: I have no problem reading books featuring LGBT themes and relationships. I just feel like the synopsis gives no clues as to what this book is really about, and lest future readers get blindsided, I think it's fair to give clear warning. If you have to resort to subterfuge to get readers to pick up a book, then why get mad at someone who points that fact out to others? Hollywood legend Evelyn Hugo is nearing 80 and decides to write her life story. She hires newcomer journalist Monique Grant for the job, and no one is more surprised about it than Monique. Evelyn will not take ""no"" for an answer, and says that if Monique won't tell the story, it will just die with her. As the story of Evelyn's life begins to unfold, Monique discovers that the public persona of Evelyn with her seven husbands does not even touch the surface of the real person behind it. The more Evelyn talks, the more is revealed about her life and loves."

2237,5.0,"Full review originally posted on my blog: Word WondersCW: Sexual assault, statutory rape, domestic physical abuse, cheating, homophobia, biphobia, alcoholism, death of loved ones, serious illnesses, mentions of suicide.Since last december, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo was ALL over my twitter timeline, everytime one of my friends read it, they became obsessed with it and joined the hype train, so it just kept getting more and more hype everyday so I eventually caved at the end of January and got it. And let me tell you. I don’t think any of my words will ever do it justice. It’s just too good, and it deserves every single praise I’ve heard about it and more. My expectations for it were sky-rocketing and it STILL managed to go above them, and fairly easily. All this to say that this review will be a struggle to write and I apologize in advance if it only half makes sense.The writing is beautiful. It’s raw, emotional and brutally honest. Which fits Evelyn’s character perfectly. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an amazing writer, the way she threads words together to make impactful sentences astounds me. There’s also the fact that she ends some of the more important chapters with these cliffhanger type sentences that scare the shit out of you and make you want to stop while everything and everyone is okay, while simultaneously compelling you to keep reading.The book is written from two POVs. It starts off with Monique’s but it’s mostly carried by Evelyn’s and spanning throughout multiple decades following her from age fourteen until well after she retired . I wouldn’t say it alternates because it’s not exactly true. Besides a few chapters at the start and at the end, most of the book is from Evelyn’s perspective as she tells her truth and life story. Monique’s chapters in the middle serve as a break between different stages of Evelyn’s life.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo starts with the question “Who is Evelyn Hugo’s one true love?” and the answer is given pretty early on so putting it in this review wouldn’t really be a spoiler but the book is an experience for the reader so I don’t want to give any piece of it away. Especially not about the characters (besides Evelyn and Monique) because Evelyn’s relationships with them are what makes the story what it is. While reading this book, I couldn’t help but feel it navigating in a grey area from start to finish. Nothing and no one is ever defined as good or bad and in my opinion, that’s what makes it so great. It’s just so real and complex.Through Evelyn Hugo’s experiences as a queer woman of color (bisexual and cuban to be exact), the author explores Old Hollywood and the many issues a woman like her could encounter during that time. The sexism, her male peers’ needs always being above hers. The racism, having to change her name, hair color, language and accent to *pass* and succeed in the industry. But more than anything, the terrible queerphobia at the time and its very real consequences on her life and relationships. The pain of having to hide a huge part of her identity (with others) and the fear that comes with the life threatening possibility of being outted. There was a gutting quote in the book that just said it all:“You imagine a world where the two of you can go out to dinner on a Saturday night, and no one thinks twice about it. It makes you want to cry, the simplicity of it. The smallness of it. You have worked so hard for a life so grand. And now all you want are the smallest freedoms. The daily peace of loving plainly.”Granted, this described above is still the reality of a lot of queer people today but back then it was EVERY SINGLE queer person’s reality. It was constant hiding for everyone with the inevitable strain that can put on relationships.The title can be misleading because you would go in expecting to learn all about Evelyn’s seven husbands and although that’s there and every section of the book is named after one of them, it’s not the main focus of the book. It’s main focus is our protagonist sharing her truth, unfiltered. This is about her paving her way in a world that’s set on bringing her down. Her wins, her losses. Her struggles. All the scandals and back stabbing. All the decisions she had to make, why she made them and their rippling consequences. Her story is so deep and multilayered, it’s ultimately heartbreaking but it had its happy moments.I think that what makes this book mine and a lot of people’s favourite (or, one of them at least) is Evelyn herself as a character. She’s one of the best or THE best crafted character I’ve ever read about. A walking, talking, mezmerizing, breathtakingly beautiful, mystery. And no matter how many terrible decisions she made I still admired her because she knew what she wanted and had the gutts to do whatever it takes to get it. She’s in no means a good person, in fact, she’s quite awful but so captivating that you can’t help but fall in love with her. She’s strong, confident, ambitous and extremely smart. I was fascinated and compelled by the way her brain worked and connected things, how she could get herself out of the most impossible situations. I think that what makes it impossible to hate her is that she’s fully aware of her actions ad that she owns up to them and never tries to hide who she really is.The other *main* character is Monique. I put that between * because to me, she didn’t really feel like a main character, she was more like a vessel to carry Evelyn’s story. Don’t get me wrong, she has a strong character arc but it felt a bit overshadowed by Evelyn’s. Monique is a thirty five year old biracial black woman who just got separated and feels stuck in her career. I quite liked her to be honest and how through discovering Evelyn’s story, she was inspired to take life by the horns and not be afraid to pursue what she really wants. I really liked seeing her bloom in that sense.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a book that moved me deeply and that I know will stick with me my whole life. It touched me and resonated with me in such deep ways that I couldn’t help but fall head over heels for it. It just put a lot of my thoughts and feelings into words that I struggled finding for myself."
2238,5.0,"Um, wow. Almost a month later, and I still don't know how to review this book.This book was intense. It played with my mind, and kept me guessing for most of the book. I have to say, I did guess the big plot twist, but not until a couple chapters before, and it still blew me away.And the CHARACTERS! They were all sooo good! Monique did get on my nerves at times (*cough cough* her comment about Evelyn being ready to come out as a gay woman, and Evelyn being like 'did you not hear anything I just said? I'm bisexual you idiot.' (Eveylyn is amazing)), but for the most part I did quite like her, and her plot line was fascinating.And then there was Evelyn. I loved Evelyn with all of my being. Evelyn was manipulative and deceitful, yes. She was greedy at times. But she was SUCH a good character! And she learned! She developed! And honestly I adored her from the start!Also this book was SO PAINFUL! 😭😭😭😭😭And ajagskhfhjgjfdshfgh I just loved it so much! The other characters were also great! And literally just everything about this book was amazing! Even if I did predict the big twist a little... But it didn't even matter, this book just blew me away. Completely and utterly. I cannot recommend it more.

Książka przecudownie napisana, przeczytana przeze mnie w zaledwie 5 godzin, nie mogłam się od niej oderwać, zachwyciła mnie jeszcze bardziej niż ,,Daisy Jones & The Six”. Chyba powinnam zacząć czytać weselsze książki, inaczej skończę na terapii, chociaż wątpię żeby wystarczyła 😭"
2240,5.0,how am I supposed to recover from this
2241,2.0,Overrated. Dull. 
2242,3.0,"After the first two chapters of this book I was sure that this is going to be a book I will never finish and I wanted to kick myself for purchasing it without reading the synopsis and reviews. Although, as you can see it wasn't a one star book, those bits and pieces that made me cringe and feel like I'm thrown into a cheap and unprofessional work didn't allow me to give this work more stars. And this notion in general is interesting, because those bad parts were bad on purpose. You know it once you have finished the book, but you cannot undo them and you cannot not dislike them. After getting over with the annoying introduction, I found a lot of story points being brilliant. The family violence was very much one of the best literary bits I have read lately. It felt so real and so raw. It was almost too short. I admit that I am one of those people who don't understand why do those families stay together, but I felt like this work of fiction made me understand the situation a tiny bit more. It was painful but beautiful and deep with meaning.Although I know this is a work of fiction, I also know that the problems with being gay depicted in this book were very much real and in some parts of the world are still real. I hope in future (and hopefully while I'm still alive), we will look back at this book and laugh in disbelief that this really once was possible and what a crazy world it must have been. As I come from a place where racism and homophobia are still alive, I especially yearn for this to change. Although the piece was ok, it didn't hit me as strong as the family violence bit. I think the situation in reality was (and is?) worse than depicted and I suppose that was what was missing. Knowing that in real time London, where I live now, two girls can be beaten up on a bus for being gay - for being on a date, makes me shake my head in disapproval and understand that it must have been a lot worse back then, while this book just shows casual articles written by tabloids. I think the outside world would be a lot more aggressive to such rumours. (view spoiler)[Celia's and Evelyn's relationship in my opinion was quite poorly depicted, I never found out why they loved each other, because I didn't see the spark between them in this novel. Besides I didn't particularly like either of them. Part of the bed scenes could have been replaced by giving me a reason to root for their relationship to believe that they can throw away their careers... I'm thought that saying that showing breasts put any disagreements aside was very shallow and I found it unrealistic that most of the serious conversations they had were in the bedroom. (hide spoiler)] The resolution is what knocked down a star. This would have been a four star read it if wouldn't be for the big reveal, the big secret. I thought it didn't matter, I couldn't understand (view spoiler)[Monique's hatred about what Evelyn did. It didn't matter, her dad was dead and nothing will change. It's not like Evelyn killed him, it's not like she knew what implications her request to move to Spain would have... (hide spoiler)] and at this point it was clear how the book will end. So I just wanted it to end without spoiling the many good bits about it. It did so reasonably quickly, but not quick enough to save that star."
2243,5.0,"This author has become a new favorite of mine. I read this story in one sitting and was hooked from beginning to end. I didn't want this to end. Evelyn Hugo is complicated, ambitious, selfish, passionate and a survivor. She struggled and fought in an industry that was dominated by the thirst for power and fame and the means to get to the top and stay there. Her hunger for fame over the decades eclipse her need to keep the love of her life in her life. You want to feel empathy for her choices but Evelyn insists throughout the story that she doesn't want pity but you can't help but feel that this woman who was dubbed the most beautiful woman in the world for decades had to forfeit a piece of herself to sustain that image and you feel a little sad for her. I loved this story, I loved Evelyn who had strength and vulnerability while making no apologies for her choices."
2244,5.0,"One of my favourite books of the year so far!I devoured this story as often as I possibly could. It was much more complex than I had anticipated when starting it and I was itching to get back to it as soon as I set it down. The novel reads like an autobiography where you hear Evelyn Hugo's life unfold from the start of her Hollywood career in the 1950's to her later years. Short tabloid and newspaper articles are added throughout the book noting important events in Hugo's life.Evelyn Hugo is a complicated character full of surprises. She is daring, brilliant and genuine. She wants her life story told upon her death and has chosen Monique Grant, a magazine reporter, to do just that.This was my 1st novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid and it definitely won't be my last."

2248,5.0,Evelyn Hugo is by far the most interesting character I have ever read about! Wow. Why did I wait so long to read this amazing book? 
2249,3.0,"This was interesting. Evelyn Hugo is quite a character who's not very likable. She's a famous movie star, she's made it to the age of 89, and in this book she's ready to give an exclusive interview about her life to Monique who has no idea why she's been chosen for the job. The overall plot with Monique was intriguing. The life story of Evelyn Hugo less so. While it was interesting to read about her rise to fame, it quickly became a bit too dull reading about her love life and being constantly surprised about her selfishness. Evelyn Hugo is a very flawed character, and while I think you were still supposed to fall for her and understand her, that didn't happen to me. Therefore, the longer I made it through the book, the more uninterested I became in her never-ending love life and marriages which ended up seeming rather sacrilegious. Not to say that this isn't an entertaining read. I would definitely recommend it - hence my 3-star-rating. Especially Monique's response to the interview and the whole situation with Evelyn Hugo was entertaining, and it was the part that I probably connected to the most. I like to think of Evelyn Hugo as Marilyn Monroe (if she had continued to live past her 30s). There are a lot of similarities between the two of them, and I love Marilyn Monroe. However, Hugo's story ended up becoming a bit too far-stretched for my taste, and I'm not sure she's a character I'll miss reading about in the upcoming days. Monique, however, that's a different story :) "
2250,5.0,"This book has been on my To-Read list since it came out, so I was extremely excited when I finally got it. A lot of my friends that have read it on Goodreads rated this book 4 stars, so I was hoping it lived up to those expectations and it did! I highly suggest this book! It is a nice, relaxing read :)""Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways."""

2257,5.0,"This was an awesome read and well-deserving of a 5-star review. When I first began the book I thought I was in store for a humorous book about the great machine of Hollywood. I was partially interested, but I felt the need understand all the great ratings and reviews. After several chapters I was hooked! This book is about Hollywood in the 1950’s and how the studios literally owned the actors. Scandals and marriages were made, just as “incidents” were covered up and buried. Evelyn Hugo was made into a star, although as you read through Evelyn’s stories it was clear that she was born to be a star. She was more than willing to get to the top by any means, and through her acting career she became a legend. As the book begins, a young, fairly unknown writer, Monique Grant, is requested to interview Evelyn and tell her story though a biographical book. The condition is that she reveal the truth, exactly as Evelyn wants it told. Why Monique was chosen for this writing task was a mystery. I kept trying to guess and fit pieces together but none fit.As the chapters and husbands rolled across the page, I felt close to the characters. I couldn’t get enough of this book! And I didn’t want the book to end. When I hit the 90% mark I started slowing down my reading. I wanted more time with these people. I’m very late to the game in finally getting around to reading this, but the book showed up just as I was ready for it. Admittedly, the stories within the book made me feel many things, questioning what love meant to me versus others, and what prices we are willing to pay. For each of us the terms are different. I will state that this was a beautiful book about a main character who thought she knew what she wanted out of life. She chased her dreams mercilessly. As she spent moments of happiness, every time she thought she had what she wanted, it would disappear. As each marriage began and ended, so did her dreams.  “ Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, waiting for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it. “This was a wonderful book that I will not forget for a long time. "
2258,5.0,"5 stars!Once again this is one book I wish I could write a full review for so a mini one will have to do...I’m going to start off by saying I was very very skeptical going into this. I’d seen so much hype surrounding this and was slightly scared. I’m not one for hyped books, but it exceeding all of my expectations!It was SO interesting to look into Evelyn Hugo’s life and it was like it was a real person. You loved her, you hated her and I actually respected her as a character. I know it sounds weird but it was just that good.The rep in this was AMAZING! I honestly cannot praise it enough! The characters are so in depth and to see the different stages of the marriages and what’s actually going on in the background. It was amazing to see the flaws in characters, being unashamed and ashamed at times and trying to overcome certain things. The tough times the characters have had to face in their life. It was just so gripping and so beautifully done.I wish I could say more but this is probably one of my favourite books I’ve read all year it was honestly such an experience.————07.04.2021Re-Read via audiobookStill absolutely adored this! I think I have just erased parts of this from my mind because of how heartbreaking the whole ending is.I still found it so interesting, and I can’t praise TJR enough for how real her characters feel, I find that to be something so so special and unique! Still an incredible read!"
2259,3.0,"Lackluster... Based on the very good ratings/reviews I came into this with pretty high expectations and, unfortunately, it ended up just being ok for me. The characters were well developed and believable with the exception of Monique. She was pretty forgettable as was her storyline. I loved glimpsing into life in Old Hollywood. It was undeniably one of the most glamorous places in the world at that time and I think Reid captured it very well. She, also, does a good job crushing that illusion of perfection through Evelyn’s life. The twists were a hard sell for me... I never bought them. Just when I started getting into the story I was slapped in the face with a plot twist that was way too forced and grasping to make a point. It was ‘in your face’ and the characters were not written to pull it off. This whole narrative throughout felt lifeless. The twist at the end really, really did not work for me at all... it, honestly, felt like a desperate attempt to be dramatic and needed up being a complete flop. Final thoughts are that the good/bad aspects of this pretty much weighed each other out to produce a novel that I found to be just ok. Sadly, I’m going against the overall consensus with my rating... 3 stars."

""It would take me years to figure out that life doesn’t get easier simply because it gets more glamorous.""
This book is amazing. Evelyn is a strong, passionate, persistent and harsh woman. She fought her way to the top and she knew what to do to get what she want. And she gave everything to reach her dreams. What a life…! The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a fiction but it’s so realistic. The characters are complex, I loved how the author described everybody. Of course our main focus is on Evelyn - her choices, her good and bad days, her winnings and failures. We get to know the details about her life from her teenage years up to her seventies, mainly in Hollywood in the 1950-80s. It’s an intriguing, extraordinary and sometimes painful journey. I’m not ashamed to admit that I cried, not just once, when I read this book. At first I wanted to give 4.5 stars, but after a few days I think this is absolutely a 5-star reading for me. This is one of my best readings in 2019. 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟"
2261,5.0,"This book is seriously something special. It is in stages heart warming, heart wrenching and heart breaking. It is, in all honesty, perfection.I don’t know what I was expecting going in but it wasn’t this. I didn’t ever want it to be over but I had to know what happened. I loved how Evelyn and Monique were both flawed and wonderful. I just loved everything about their characterisations and how they fit together. The growth of Monique and how that was linked to the build of her relationship with Evelyn, was just fantastic. It all fit together so well. Not one of my favourite books of the year, this is one of my favourite books of all time. **********If I could give this a million stars I would. I loved this so goddamn much.

2263,1.0,"****Spoilers*********Spoilers*****1 star. I knew I was in for it from the very very beginning when I read the dedication page of this book: It reads as follows:""Smash the patriarchy, sweetheart.""...Oh good god *eye roll* Give me a break... I would like to call this book review: The Seven Rants of Evelyn Hugo (and friends)They go as follows:1. Evelyn is the most immoral character I have ever read about in my life. What kind of message is the author sending to young women with the character of Evelyn Hugo? Fuck, lie, cheat, scheme your way into getting anything you want regardless of who it hurts or the damage your actions can cause. Only focus on yourself, your own desires, your own pleasures and to hell with the rest of it. Where is the self-respect in spreading your legs to reach fame and fortune? Where is the dignity in bending over so you can manipulate people? Oh yeah, just as long as it is in the name of WOMAN POWER! Silly, me.  2. Monique annoyed the hell out of me.The attempt made by the author for Monique's personal life and some of Evelyn's personal life to run in parallels was basically spoon fed to the reader. She felt like a super undeveloped character, with barely any social skills from the way she talked to Evelyn, (I mean I had second-hand embarrassment with this character) and none of Monique's issues besides the death of her dad were all that shocking or relatable. Dang, Monique, you just had one of the richest women in the world ask you to write her life's story knowing you will make millions and millions off of it and your over here acting like you were just asked to eat three bags of sand. 3. ""Smells like clay""I literally laughed out loud at the sheer stupidity of the way Evelyn described Celia coming out of the shower. This is not verbatim... ""She didn't smell like shampoo, she smelled like clay."" Clay?? Clay??? .... uhhhhh.....come again. 4. The Abortion Look, I am going to be frank in saying I think abortion is wrong on so many levels and for a multitude of reasons. But the way the book just handled abortion and how grossly irresponsible Evelyn was in her sexual relations is something that I find truly deplorable. Where is humanity going? Evelyn literally says she crosses her fingers, as she is screwing this guy, and hopes for the best...aka I hope I don't get pregnant...oh but don't worry if I do I can just do a little baby murdering... no big deal. This is bad folks... bad... not what we should be idolizing or raving about. This is not a progressive and strong this female character this is a whore with no morals or values. I find it repulsive. 5. Suicide I cannot believe this book went to this place... I guess I should not have been too surprised but the truth is I was. Evelyn's suicide was so poorly handled. The author just pretty much gave the green light for people who are suicidal to end their life if that's what they truly want. If Evelyn is powerful and can get what she wants no matter who or what's in her way, well why can't I? And if death is what I want well let me take that too... just like Evelyn did. This was in such bad taste and I do not understand how people are not totally upset with the suicide at the end? I mean, the author wrote her suicide to be poetic and romantic.. ""she just wants to go home"" ""she has no one left she loves here."" ""my chest made me, my chest won't end me."" ..where is the rage people?!6. Grace's vacation.Oh Gracie, dear, I love you so much, you work so hard and you are deserving of a beautiful, relaxing vacation with your husband. Bye bye, have fun, run along. 8 hours later... Gracie dears vacation (and emotional well being) is ruined because Evelyn commits suicide... 7. The Hook of the BookWhen the author has to tell you the hook of this book is who was Evelyn Hugo's greatest love and then not even halfway through the book she just straight up tells you and then you get to follow the pathetic drama between her and the lover... while the big reveal is the woman who is writing your life story is the daughter of your best friend's/ex-husband's second gay lover...??? ugh, what!!!!Puke on that.How is this book getting 5 stars? How are people thinking this immoral, grotesque, crap is revolutionary. God help us. "
2264,5.0,"Power or love?Fame or obscurity?Pride or Fortune?This story is about Evelyn Hugo. About a ruthless, intelligent, charming and beautiful woman. A woman whose life is filled of pain, suffering. Of lying, cheating, using, and manipulating people, but also love.Evelyn Hugo is not a kind person nor she is sweet and likeable. Beyond that blond hair, perfect eyebrows, and her envious body, she is a woman trapped in fame.In her younger years, she showed ambition, cunningness, and thirst for fame and fortune. She would not hesitate to use her body to get what she wanted, she would not hesitate to use other people either to get where she dreamed of. But along the way, love happened. Love for someone whom if anybody found out would put her career in jeopardy and ruined everything she had built. Love for someone who was a kindred soul to her, a platonic love with someone she can even call family after years of not knowing what family was supposed to be. Love for a daughter, someone she loved and cared for whom she would do anything for.Simply put, she was not born in the right time. Evelyn have done immoral and questionable things in her life. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is not a love story or a biography of a fictional woman. It is a tragedy. Behind her beauty, her riches and fame, she was just a woman trying to find love and family in a cruel world. It is a story about a woman who would do anything to gain power only to realise that all of it was forfeit.I honestly cried reading this. I felt like I know Evelyn personally. Taylor Jenkins Reid had craftily and poignantly made a stunning book about an incredible woman and what it means to be a person. I can honestly say that this won't be the last time I'll be reading her books. Simply, this book is stunning and I hope more people would read it and feel Evelyn's pain, joy and love between each pages."

“When you’re given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn’t give things, you take things.”
If I could give this book more than five stars I would. It is one of the most beautifully written books I’ve ever read, a masterpiece that perfectly captures the realness and the rawness of being human. This story is unforgettable, heartbreaking, and magnificent. Its genius storytelling evoked a lot of emotion from me. Along with the storytelling, the plot was unique, intriguing, and captivating. As I read this book, I caught myself thinking, is this story real? Is Evelyn Hugo based on a real person? And even though it’s fiction, it portrays the story of many people from the LGBTQ+ community that have gone through something similar. “A world where we could be ourselves, without fear and without shame.”Evelyn Hugo is such a complex character, her self-awareness of being morally-grey is a big point of the book. Even though some of the things she did were undoubtedly awful, at the end we’re all humans who make mistakes, and she didn’t want to be seen as something she was not. I absolutely loved her character, with her flaws and all. Her desire and determination to succeed despite everything that was thrown her way was admirable and empowering. “It’s always been fascinating to me how things can be simultaneously true and false, how people can be good and bad all in one, how someone can love you in a way that is beautifully selfless while serving themselves ruthlessly.”Evelyn’s relationship with Celia broke my heart into pieces. Their letters were heart-wrenching. I felt her pain of losing Celia and her regret of not doing what she should have done to have more time with her. “It makes you want to cry, the simplicity of it, the smallness of it. You have worked so hard for a life so grand. And now all you want are the smallest freedoms. The daily peace of loving plainly.”Many important topics were discussed in this book, with relevancy not only to society in the past but more importantly to today’s culture. Specifically, sexuality, LGBTQ+ rights, the gender gap in the industry, domestic abuse, alcoholism, racism, suicide, and more. I believe the author did a great job representing these issues, making the story more real and true. “I think loving you has been the truest thing about me.”It was a moving and breathtaking story that made me cry a lot and feel a lot. I don't think I can express completely what I felt reading this book, and my review definitely does not make the book justice. The plot, the descriptions, the characters, the setting, the husband's monikers, Monique representing the audience, Evelyn's narration, the articles, the letters; everything was perfectly imperfect. I fell in love with the story from the beginning, and it enraptured me until the very last sentence. "

""I think being yourself-your true, entire self-is always going to feel like you're swimming upstream.""

 HOW TRUE IS THAT?!This book pretty much wraps life and the lessons to be learned. How can I add five and a hundred stars ???Folks, believe the reviews made before me. IT WAS THAT GOOD, THAT BEAUTIFUL, THAT TOXICATING.The premise is very simple : an extraordinary thing happened to ordinary protagonist that changed the protagonist's life forever.BUT THERE'S NOTHING SIMPLE AS THE STORY ITSELF UNFOLDS.Monique is your usual main protagonist : a woman who was unfulfilled, living a mediocre, unsatisfying, considered failed life. Until one day, a superstar icon named Evelyn Hugo, wanted Monique to write her biography book. But, why Monique? There must be a reason why THE Evelyn Hugo chose her, right?

""I've spent a very long time learning how to ... spin the truth,"" she says. ""It's hard to undo that wiring. I've gotten too good at it, I think. Just now, I wasn't exactly sure how to tell the truth. I don't have very much practice in it. It feels antithetical to my very survival. But I'll get there.""

This is a story of the life of Evelyn Hugo. Not just the husbands, like the title suggests, but also the very insights, scandals, grief, doubts. This is a story of self-love, self-hate, feminism, love, sex, betrayal, family. I'm not kidding that this book is about life itself, and the lesson to be learned from it. I also am not kidding when I say I'd give this book five and a hundred stars. It's breathtaking.Sometimes when you found an amazing book, or anything that excedeed your expectations, you found yourself having troubles wording WHY you love the book, and simply feeling that you LOVE the book so much. This is one for me.What I love the most about this is that it was a story about human. It was fiction, but it was very much realistic. My heart ached together with the protagonists, and I insanely cared about the protagonists so much. Reading this book, I found that this isn't a beautiful world. And you make do of it, because you have no choice. You make do the better things you can do. The lesser of two evils. 

People think that intimacy is about sex.But intimacy is about truth.When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is ""You're safe with me""-that's intimacy.

I wouldn't say this is a hard book, but it was packed with life lessons. It's also a scandalous book, and I LOVE IT (who doesn't love scandals, amirite!?). Here's one excerpt from my favorite chapter :
You start crying.And then he's gone.And you stop.And you think, If only they gave out Oscars for this shit.
MY REACTION : BRAVO, BRAVO!I saw a review that said the author has successfully depicted and represent a bisexual, and I'm thankful for the lesson I learned. I'm neutral in that field, and reading this book has deepened my understanding and I'm glad this book taught me that.And before we close the curtain, my last favorite quote from the one and only Evelyn Hugo :

You wonder what it must be like to be a man, to be so confident that the final say is yours.

[STANDING OVATION FOR THE ONE AND ONLY FEMINIST ICON, EVELYN HUGO]"
2271,5.0,"THIS BOOK WAS FABULOUS. This was my suggestion for my book club and I'm so glad it was.Evelyn was such a fascinating character who struggled and went through so much and was unashamed and unrepentant of most (if not all) of it. I loved how she explained to Monique why she didn't regret the things she did and why she stood firm in her decisions, even if they made her look like a bad person. Evelyn is a fabulous, fascinating, morally gray, incredible bisexual woman and her story really draws you in and keeps you reading. It's also interesting because while she tells you her story in a truthful way, you can't help but think that she is a somewhat unreliable narrator.It was also fascinating to get an inside look into Hollywood, especially the PR side of it, which I have from a few sources that a lot of it was very accurate to how things work.The Monique mystery really keeps you hooked until the very end of the book - it's what made me NEED to finish as soon as i possibly could.10/10 would RECOMMEND definitely you should read this book."
2272,5.0,"Wow! This is one of my favourite reads this year and possibly of all time?? I was completely mesmerized by the complex characters, 110% invested in their lives, fascinated by the historical details and insights into the human condition, and unbelievably moved by the story. I cried so many times! What a beautiful epic love story, and a wonderfully nuanced and smart portrayal of a bisexual woman! It's one of the best bisexual characters I have ever encountered. I LOVED IT SO MUCH. Also: fabulous audiobook voice acting. I just want to start re-reading it again right away."
2273,5.0,"“Nobody deserves anything,” Evelyn says. “It’s simply a matter of who’s willing to go and take it for themselves. No one is just a victim or a victor. Everyone is somewhere in between. People who go around casting themselves as one or the other are not only kidding themselves, but they’re also painfully unoriginal.”Breathtaking. Heartbreaking. Awesome. Brilliant. I AM IN LOVE."
2274,5.0,A book worth every single ounce of hype. It might also be my new favourite. 
2275,4.0,Superó con creces todas las expectativas que le tenía a esta historia; hasta me llegaron a caer lágrimas en el final.
2276,5.0,↠ 5 starsThis pleasantly surprised me. Love the way the story was set up and though the ending was bittersweet I would definitely read this again.
2277,5.0,"I have so many thoughts and feelings about this book I don't even know where to begin or how to put them in order, but we have to start somewhere so, let's begin, shall we?(am I going to get cheesy and melancholic in this review? Yes, this was a very emotional read lol)Plot: Monique Grant is a 35 year old struggling writer living in New York City. Dealing with her professional career going nowhere and her husband leaving her, Monique is at an all time low. Having worked for the prestigious Vivant for less than a year, she had not yet been given many opportunities, thus stalling her writing career. One day, she learns some life-changing news from her editor: actress Evelyn Hugo, a famous actress from the 1960s, has agreed to an interview with Vivant under the condition that Monique is the one to do the interview. Though she is stunned by the request, Monique realizes the opportunity could make her career, that is if she doesn't allow herself to be star struck by one of the most famous actresses in the world. Evelyn Hugo takes Monique on a tempestuous ride as she uncovers the truth of her glamorous life and career. These truths form a connection between Monique and Evelyn until too many truths lead their lives to intersect in a tragic way.World description and writing:This book succeeded every expectation I had over it, it was just what I wanted and what I needed right now. The author did an amazing job portraying Evelyn´s story and it kept me so hooked during the whole book that reading this at 2am when I had school at 7am, was really hard as you may imagine. As it is set in New York and Hollywood in the 60`s, the aesthetic of this is immaculate. It was beautiful both to read and to imagine. It gave me a sense of comfort and it reminded me of how we need to be more grateful about the simple things and about the people we have in our lives because they can be gone in the blink of an eye. Characters: (only main ones cause yes;)Evelyn:I cannot express how much I loved her character, she was such a badass who knew exactly what she wanted for her life and exactly how to get it. Also, her story was one of the best things I've ever read in my life, it was so unexpectedly beautiful and heartbreaking. I've been thinking about this character since I started reading this book and I don't think I will ever forget her. Her story made me feel all the emotions possible, I was sad, happy, angry and even disappointed. This book and Evelyn´s character got me thinking about my own life and for me, that's when you know you've read a good book, when you realize how much it bursted through your soul and the impact it made in it. Celia: Oh Celia. She was such a precious character and im completely in love with the relationship she and Evelyn had; they were there for each other even when they were the most apart and there wasn't one minute when they weren't thinking about each other; because at the end of the day, that's what love is right? Love is selfless and for you to love and be loved the correct way you need to open up and fight for it if you have to, because it doesn't matter who you love, it only matters how you love (im a hopeless romantic and also a huge sarcasm queen, how ironic isn't it?) Harry: I LOVE THIS MAN. He was the sweetest character in the whole book and he always was the most respectful and caring person in every room. He was always there by Evelyn´s side besides everything they went through and he always knew what to say and when to say it. His story broke my heart as well (but the whole book did lmao)Monique:I actually really liked her character and I loved seeing that as she got to know Evelyn´s story she started discovering herself and what she really wanted for her life. The plot twist in this left me totally surprised and I never expected it.I loved her relationship with Evelyn and how it developed along the book; she could see right through Evelyn, besides she was probably the most famous woman in the world. Here are some of my favourite quotes:""He agreed with me. It was cold. But then he said, “Just breathe in and out five times. And when you’re done, I bet it won’t feel so cold.”I watched as he put his feet in. I watched him breathe. And then I put my feet back in and breathed with him. He was right, of course. It wasn’t so cold.After that, my dad would breathe with me anytime I was on the verge of tears. When I skinned my elbow, when my cousin called me an Oreo, when my mom said we couldn’t get a puppy, my father would sit and breathe with me. It still hurts, all these years later, to think about those moments.""“Do you understand what I’m telling you? When you’re given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn’t give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.”""So how can I condemn the fourteen-year-old girl who did whatever she could to get herself out of town? And how can I judge the eighteen-year-old who got herself out of that marriage once it was safe to do so?""""Be wary of men with something to prove""""He said, “You have to do that, too, Monique. When you’re older. You have to find a job that makes your heart feel big instead of one that makes it feel small. OK? You promise me that?” He put out his hand, and I shook it, like we were making a business deal. I was six. By the time I was eight, we’d lost him.""""But my heart wasn’t in it. My heart was never in the craft of acting, only in the proving. Proving my power, proving my worth, proving my talent.I’d proved it all.""“I want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.” I grabbed his hand tighter. “But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it’s time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.”""Evelyn Hugo just wants to go home. It’s time for her to go to her daughter, and her lover, and her best friend, and her mother.”""Her dress is low-cut, revealing her still-ample cleavage, and it occurs to me that it is the very thing that made her that will be the thing to finally take her down.""""Evelyn was never going to let the thing that made her be the thing to destroy her. She was never going to let anything, even a part of her body, have that sort of power.Evelyn is going to die when she wants to.And she wants to die now.""""And maybe one day I’ll find someone I love the way Evelyn loved Celia. Or maybe I might just find someone I love the way my parents loved each other”“No,” she told me. “Because they are just husbands. I am Evelyn Hugo. And anyway, I think once people know the truth, they will be much more interested in my wife.”So, to sum up, I can't get tired of talking about this book and I can not stop thinking about it. I´m not usually a historical fiction reader but maybe I am now (?); this was beautiful in every way and one of the most original books I've ever read in my life."
2278,5.0,"5/5Amazing. Just amazing. Honestly, I dnfed this book twice before finishing it, but I was determined to finish this time and I loved it. This book was absolutely incredible. I'm not even sure why I couldn't get into it the first two times. Everything about this book was perfect, from the writing to the characters to the plot. I stayed up until 5 in the morning to finish this book, and by the end, I was a crying, sleep-deprived mess. I would highly recommend this book now if you'll excuse me. I need to go find what other books I own by Taylor Jenkins Reid.Also, fun fact that my dumbass had no idea this was sapphic and thought it was about a lady killing her husband's, but honestly, it made the experience better. "
2279,5.0,This book is a fucking masterpiece. Evelyn Hugo is literally an icon. No one can deny this and I will accept no criticism about this. period.
2280,4.0,"Tatatataaaa, may I announce you one of the best of the best reads of 2021? During my read: I cried a lot... I sniffled...I giggled the sarcastic humor of the author when she described the party animal celebrities! My heart warmed up when I read four siblings’ close, honest relationships. I mesmerized by the whirlwind time travel ride between 50’s to 80’s! I was shaken to the core, emotions are everywhere after reading Mick and June’s tragic, blasting, heartbreaking story! TJR is one of my all time best historical fiction authors! She perfectly tells different and original life stories by creating flawed, broken but still standing, resilient characters who never give up to fight ! At this book she’s centered on Riva family and there are two main storylines : ( Riva family’s history starting from mid 50’s and Nina’s annual Malibu house party with the attendance of powerful societal, famous artists including popular actors, musicians, athletes, surfers, tennis players who really know partying wildly ) If this book is only about Mick and June’s heart wrenching story, I would give ten stars ! The flashback parts of the family history, the couple’s toxic, sad story and Nina’s sacrifices to become her own siblings’ mother, giving up on her life to protect them, providing them better life conditions broke my heart several times. I loved the siblings’ devoted loyalty. Interestingly not only Nina, but also Jay, Hud and Kit acted like the mature ones of the family as their parents acted like their children. Especially the youngest one, Katherine/ Kit was quick witted, emotional, straightforward: she doesn’t hold anything back inside of her and her slow self discovery about her sexuality, her own capabilities, brave life choices.  The boys were a little overshadowed by her two tough, vivid sisters but I still love to see how they grow and how hard they fight to be more decent man than their father.  Only thing made me cut points was party theme which had “Little Fires Everywhere” ( two sisters, two brothers and a house on fire ) vibes. I enjoyed to read the entertaining, eccentric characters’ side stories throughout the night which ended scandalously! But I wish the story would be only focus on Rivas and the way of their facing problems about the past, their secrets, the things hold them back to move on. When you add too many characters into equation it is still enjoyable to read, it is a little bit distracting your attention from the main story!  I loved the conclusion! Especially Nina’s changing. At the end she learns to stand up for herself, rejecting to be the victim of the story! Even though I gave four fantastic historical, sweet sixties , viva X generation stars, I can honestly say I loved to read this book and to be introduced with those shiny, well-crafted characters. This is gonna be one of the most thought provoking, sensational, popular fictions of the next year and I’m so happy to have privilege to read its advance copy! TJR is awakening the artistic soul of the readers with her extra creative and realistic story telling skills. I highly recommend this book not only her fans but also addicted historical fiction readers.Special thanks to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group/ Ballantine Books for sharing this reviewer copy with me in exchange my honest opinions.instagramfacebooktwitter"
2281,2.0,"2 1/2 stars. I like all kinds of books. I like fast-paced gossipy dramas and slower, character-driven literary works. I like the books that you read desperately, that you can't put down, and the ones that make you stop and contemplate something you hadn't before. But, while I didn't always dislike Malibu Rising, I do think it falls somewhere right between the two-- not quite juicy enough to keep me up late, but a far cry from a complex literary novel.Maybe it would have felt more like the latter if it hadn't been stretched so thin over its cast of six central characters. As it is, what we have is a lukewarm soap opera. The Riva family interested me and drew me in initially, but I was left unmoved by the skimming over of some of their struggles. The tumultuous relationship between Mick and June Riva-- and the well-drawn setting of 1950s Malibu --was the best part of the book for me, and the pace noticeably slowed when the story returned to their offspring."
2283,5.0,"there are some authors who were born to tell stories and TJR is one of them.i love the way im always pulled into her books. she has a way of writing words that seep into my very being. every single thing the characters feel, from the big heart-shattering betrayals to the small moments of sibling pride, i feel. TJR doesnt just get a reader to sympathise for characters, but empathise with them, and thats what makes reading her books a truly great experience. the riva siblings feel like real people, people i have come to know and understand and appreciate, and i love that.the characters (honestly cant pick a favourite - theyre all great), the awesome setting (this story made me want to surf - and i hate the ocean/beach), the pristine writing (the prologue is one of my favourite chapters of all time) all make this a story to remember. it definitely has the same charm and honesty that made both ‘the seven husbands of evelyn hugo’ and ‘daisy jones & the six’ so memorable. TJR never disappoints. ↠ 5 stars"
2284,5.0,"é impressionante a facilidade que a taylor jenkins reid tem de criar histórias humanas, sejam elas simples ou grandiosas; sejam os personagens astros do cinema, da cena musical & artística ou apenas um mero casal passando por dificuldades mundanas. a maneira com que ela administra perfeitamente a vida desses personagens é palpável e, no caso de malibu renasce, isso acontece fazendo com que o leitor seja mais um convidado da enorme festa que acontece na casa de nina riva, uma das várias crias do superfamoso cantor mick riva.apesar de ser o acontecimento do livro, a festa foi só um dos momentos que a autora mostrou a evolução da própria escrita. os detalhes descritos, a perfeita representação burguesa e artística dos anos 80, tudo foi tão bem pontuado que cheguei a sentir o cheiro de maresia exalando das páginas. malibu renasce é um emaranhado de sentimentos, passando pela raiva, compreensão, perdão, egoísmo, decepção e só... as dores e delícias de viver, intensamente ou não. aliás, o que é viver com intensidade, afinal de contas?sem sombra de dúvidas, ele compõe a tríplice coroa de taylor jenkins reid pra mim, junto com evelyn e daisy. ela é a autora que vai marcar uma geração e é muito bonito termos essa certeza quando entramos em contato com suas obras."
2285,4.0,"3.5 stars rounded up to 4. This was a weird reading experience for me, if I'm being honest. I absolutely blew through it, picking my kindle up to sneak in an extra page or two during every spare moment that I had. I adored the first 60ish% of the story, but things kind of started to go down hill for me as we approached the big party and the ultimate climax of everything. As we get into the party, we go from reading exclusively from the perspectives of the Rivas, to reading short little snippets from a bunch of random party guests and it all just ended up feeling a little disjointed to me. I feel like that aspect mixed with the way that the main plot wrapped up made the ending feel... unspectacular??? That feels so harsh to say because I honestly did enjoy the book as a whole, but I can't help but wish that I hadn't ended up quite as disappointed in the ending as I did. Idk this reading experience was v weird and this review was really ramble-y but TL;DR: this wasn't *perfect* for me but I did still enjoy it and I definitely plan to continue reading everything that Taylor Jenkins Reid publishes in the future!CW: sexual harassment, cheating, dieting, domestic abuse, child neglect, alcoholism, drug/alcohol abuse, death of a loved one, abortion, miscarriage"
2286,4.0,"I just finished Malibu Rising, and I'm overwhelmed with emotions. I laughed, I cried, and I come away feeling like the Riva family irrevocably touched my heart.On its surface, there's nothing immediately special about this story. It's a tale of functional and dysfunctional relationships and families all wrapped up in the setting of a party, and it's been done many times before. Yet, Taylor Jenkins Reid infuses so much more into it. There's something about her characters, her writing, and her plot, some intangible quality that is more than the sum of its part. It draws me in and keeps me riveted from beginning to end.I think your enjoyment of this book will depend largely on how much you can relate to the drama in here. For me, it rang true, and I was struck by how much I connected with so many different characters and their emotions. The search for love and belonging, the pressure to set aside your passions for familial obligations, the urge to love someone who can't always be there when you need them, it all cut deeply through me.My one nitpick is that when we get to the actual party, there were too many side characters and it took a little bit away from the focus of the story. I'm not sure if we needed to know all of them, and their introduction and side-issues became a bit confusing and convoluted to me. But it's a pretty minor quibble overall.I've read all of Reid's recent books and it seems like she can do no wrong. She has a real knack for taking a fluffy beach read and elevating it to an emotional height usually reserved for literary fiction, while still keeping me completely engrossed. I cannot wait to see what else she comes up with.This was my Book of the Month pick for June. If you're curious about BOTM or want to find out how to get your first book for $5, click here."
2287,2.0,"I love a good prank as much as the next person, which is to say: kind of, sometimes, hypothetically, and not when it happens to me.So the fact that I am forced to assume that this book represents the culmination of a years-long trick you all have been playing on me is NOT good news.I have read everything Taylor Jenkins Reid has ever written, from when she wrote exclusively in the tiny micro-genre of Chick Lit About Bad Things Happening To Kind Boring Women And The Aftermath, to now, when she writes exclusively in the tiny micro-genre of Historical Fiction Set In The Back Half Of The Twentieth Century About Good Women Doing Bad Or Neutral Things In The Name Of Generic Feminism. I have never given any of it below a 2.5 rounded up, and even that was of the ""this is trash but fun trash"" variety.SO I ANTICIPATED THIS WITH GREAT EAGERNESS. An eagerness that was only FUELED by the ENDLESS loving reviews and GLORIFYING hype and UNDYING high average rating!But you guys!This book isn't good!It's been so goddamn long since I've been in this position. I got tired of being the unpopular opinion girl. I got sick of yucking your collective yum, but more importantly, I was not super into dreading checking my own comments on a regular basis. So I worked on myself. I was in the brain equivalent of a superhero workout montage. (I'm realizing now - why would a superhero really need to work out? They're magic. I think I'm making this up. I don't watch superhero movies, because again, I GOT TIRED OF BEING THE UNPOPULAR OPINION GIRL.) (It all comes full circle.)I actually tried to pick up only books I really thought I would like. And it worked! Kinda. My average rating hit ever so slightly above 3 stars for the first time in years. Huge for me, depressing for anyone else - which is my wheelhouse, generally.And then this book came along. WHICH I SHOULD HAVE LIKED.And it ruined...everything.I'm just going to say it: This book is poorly written. It tells without showing. The descriptions are insane. The chapter endings are continually bizarre, alternating between saccharine and nonsensical and a combination of both. Compared to TJR's other books, I feel like somehow an early draft was published by mistake and everyone just has to run with it to avoid embarrassment.It is, top to bottom, overly sweet.And, while I typically do care about the often-boring sometimes-not characters that popular Reid's books, and I feel for the nightmarish scenarios that nonstop befall them almost too much, that wasn't so true here. In essence, I felt bad for these people without caring about them. Does that make sense? In other words it was all the downsides of empathy with none of the ups. AND I LOVE BOOKS ABOUT SIBLINGS. I am someone with three of them, and I downright adore those bozos. There's nothing I love reading about more than found families and real families. But the goddamn Rivas didn't even feel like siblings, to me. More like weird friends, each with half of a personality, so on the 2 pages they're together you can pretend there are only two and they're real people.I am so upset.Bottom line: Ms Jenkins Reid, please go back to the chick lit. Just for one book. Then we can talk about this later.I need a break.------------------pre-reviewokay. honesty hour. everyone knows this isn't good and is just pranking me, right?...i can't be the unpopular opinion girl again. i won't do it.either way, review to come / 1.5 stars------------------currently-reading updatesbrought this on a train because i thought it'd be a pleasure to binge read. instead i had to force myself through the first 100 pages.send thoughts and prayers.------------------tbr reviewlook at me. look me in the eyes. anything taylor jenkins reid writes.

2288,1.0,"ARC provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review  (💌 full, unedited review on my blog, because the original version was too long for goodreads)white nuclear families will literally surf instead of going to therapy for their trauma this is one of those rare and extraordinary instances where my rage over a book propelled me through its pages at a speed i am totally unused to. i'm typically a slower reader, especially when losing myself in a world i love. this is because i enjoy soaking up details, really sitting with and unpacking the many layers that i've come to expect of long-form fiction. my experience with malibu rising was the utter opposite. i flew through the pages in a fit of wrath. if a five star novel is an onion, this was a single sheet of tissue paper. when i saw the overwhelmingly positive reviews this book has been racking up, i felt a similar confusion as i had last year, after finishing the invisible life of addie larue and finding that i was pretty alone in my dissatisfaction. i want to chalk this up to the fact that in both scenarios, i had never read a taylor jenkins reid or v.e. schwab book, respectively, and so had no biases or expectations coming into either book. i had never experienced these authors’ writing styles. i didn't know what to expect. i had no preconceived opinions to contend with. i was just along for the ride. part of me also wonders if maybe these books suffer from the cult classic syndrome so common on goodreads—the question of whether everyone genuinely enjoys these authors as much as they claim, or if, perhaps, their universal popularity among goodreads users has begun to affect the dimensions of public opinion/reviews. sometimes this website does feel like a bit of an echo chamber.i can't say for sure. i can only speak for myself when i write that i remain unmoved by author popularity or proclaimed talent. beloved books have no effect on me. neither do my goodreads friends' opinions (just as i'd hope my own opinions won't ""change"" anyone else's true feelings). even despite all of that, though, i know i'm not the wrong audience for these books. romance and found family are some of my favorite things to read about and when done well, it's not hard for a book to sway me, even with glaring faults.having said all of that, malibu rising was something of a disaster from start to finish. i feel like this preface is necessary because i know reid has garnered a very loyal fanbase. after combing through other reviews, i see that a few who have more extensive experience with her books feel this was a huge departure from fan favorites like daisy jones and the six and evelyn hugo. that's relieving to hear (even if i have no desire to ever pick up a book from this author again). this was very much commercial fiction and i'm wondering if that—commercial/genre trends—hasn't had some kind of effect on the quality of writing.before launching into the many issues i had with the novel, i want to warn you that i'm going to be laying out a good amount of spoilers.to begin to illustrate the many emotions i felt over the course of this novel, i have handpicked some annotation—of the 146 or so i jotted down—highlights from my kindle:• that's enough heterosexuality for today• fathers will be like hope i am not a person to you guys but a concept then disappear in a cloud of mist and wonder why you are deeply and irrevocably traumatized• what in the name of filler• IS IT EVERY BITCH IN THIS BOOK?• why i hate malibu rising? i will try to be brief (1/435)• and then the entire audience gasped• first plot point that doesn't piss me off (annotated 75% into the novel)• the men in this book: I HATE GETTING ACCUSED OF SOME SHIT I ACTUALLY DID 😡 WHO THE FUCK TOLD YOU• this reminds me of the great gatsby when jay is throwing the party to end all parties and then suddenly goes Everybody Log Out I Wanna Be alone with my hunny Rightnow LIKE BRO YOU LITERALLY INVITED THE ENTIRE TRISTATE AREA TO YOUR PLACE OF RESIDENCE? A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT• ""eww she fuck the tennis man for tennis balls"" - a bitch that's fucking the tennis man for Large Midcentury Unglazed Terracotta Planters on Standsnow, let me defend my one star rating. there are—generally speaking—three major components i look for in a novel and build a rating around (though they are often adjusted according to the parameters set by each individual book i read). plot is not listed among them because, in many cases, fully fleshed out characters are enough to carry a book for me. 1. writing2. characters3. worldto begin with: the writing. reid's is not particularly impressive. more often than not, i found the prose in this novel aggravating, prone to drama, awkwardly descriptive in places and absolutely barren in others. certain stylistic choices, like the third person omniscient perspective, make the novel feel clinical and impersonal—not because this perspective is inherently impersonal, but because reid's execution is. because the writing style keeps readers at arm's length, it does not feel like i know these characters. instead, it feels like i know someone else who does, someone relaying facts about people, with little to no introspection or interesting, informative character interaction. this drove me up the wall because i love third person omniscient—it might be my favorite point of view to both read and write—and i've seen it done fantastically, in ways that humanize characters, that make you feel intimately, humiliatingly connected to fictional people. this was not that.readers travel backwards and forwards through time, watching the story of the riva children's parents unfold in the past, then catapulting back into the present as these children grapple with what it means to grow up parentless in old hollywood over a 24 hour time period. the structure is designed to create an impression of cause and effect, but because reid lays it on so thick, vaulting back and forth through time quickly becomes tedious.since we're on the topic of laying it on thick: the melodrama, dialed all the way up, sits at a resting 100% throughout the novel, while any sense of reward falls flat. it's a lot like listening to a radio station that's nothing but static at the highest possible volume setting. i'm getting this outpouring of sound, but it's doing nothing for me, evokes no reaction, is more grating than it is gratifying.in a prologue that seems to want to emulate celeste ng's little fires everywhere, readers are informed through foreshadowing that nina riva's big hollywood party is doomed to end in flames. this prepares readers for a habit the narrative is guilty of repeatedly and unapologetically committing: melodramatic foreshadowing, or preemptive, godlike observations. sometimes this foreshadowing arrives chapters before a certain realization or reckoning unfolds in real time; sometimes, pages. others, mere paragraphs. this writing device colors the novel completely, making eventual emotional payoff feel cheap, and unearned. it blunts the impact of conflict, stifles anticipation, and turns a mounting sense of tension into a plateau of exhaustion. the consequence of this choice is that i was no longer willing to be surprised by reid's writing. i expected every plot twist. i saw things coming from a mile away. i was biding my time while i waited impatiently for the book to end, and even after finally getting my emotional vindication as things came to a close, i was left ultimately unsatisfied. why? because i'd figured out the plot of malibu rising by the 10% mark.this tediousness is never more true than with the novel's failed romance, which brings us to characters.in the goodreads version of this review, i'm only going to touch on one of those romances: june and mick riva. if you want my take on nina and brandon, you can check my blog.aside from the fact that mick is a grown man seducing a seventeen-year-old girl, we know from the beginning that his romance with june is doomed to end in tragedy. more of that pesky foreshadowing: ""the story of june and mick riva seemed like a tragedy to their oldest child, nina."" as readers come to learn, june is the victim of a serial cheater who up and abandons his children on a whim to fuck what we can only assume are hundreds of women (at times as young as eighteen) over the course of his music career, fathering clandestine children while married, divorcing his wife to remarry one of the many women he's having a public affair with, returning to briefly atone for his sins to his family, then running off to remarry again. and again. and again. it was exhausting to type that little summary out. now imagine reading an unreasonably drawn out retelling of that story, when you know every step of the way what kind of man mick is, and just how eagerly june is going to open her doors for him despite it.the worst part isn't the fact that june is cheated on, over and over, without remorse, while she sits at home performing domestic labor for her (ex-)husband. no. the worst offense is that mick is the crux of june's entire character.while he is permitted a career, a more fleshed out origin story, and desires wholly independent of the women of this world, all june ever aspires to be is the housewife and mother waiting at the window for her cheating husband to return. she has no personality beyond loving mick. from introduction until death, she is waiting and hoping mick will return in order to complete her, to give her what she needs to become a functioning human again. because, ""...to june, it was, always and forever, a romance.""that, to me, is most egregious.all the time spent trying to paint a picture of generational trauma to explain the gleeful ways in which mick exploits women for personal gain—the ways he sees them only insofar as they can perform for him as sexual objects—could have gone to understanding june and her family outside of a man.it is choices like these that sabotage the characters in malibu rising, which is a bit of a lead-in to its world. at times, i forgot that i wasn't reading contemporary fiction. it's only offhand details like random celebrity name-drops (occasionally real celebrities, occasionally fictional) that remind readers these characters are living in the past. malibu rising features a weak facsimile of old hollywood, only believable in that the men of this world are unrepentantly shitty and more often white than not. imagine if the great gatsby were a lifetime made-for-tv movie adaptation. that's the way this book reads.reid expends most of her effort trying to build a believable party in the second half of the novel that feels vintage enough to convince you it could be real. how is this achieved? no, not through lush detail and three-dimensional characters. through slipshod head-jumping. which brings me to my next point: filler.i would argue that over half of this novel is filler. in fact, i have counted at least nineteen filler chapters (or ""sections"") in this book—meaning, had they been discarded during the editing process or even condensed into larger combined chapters, the narrative landscape would have remained completely and totally unchanged. in other words, they serve no real purpose. they exist to take up time and space. in a book that is 384 pages long, this choice is particularly needless.malibu rising's second half (aptly called ""part two"") displays the very worst of this habit. as is often the case with sloppily executed omniscient narration, we head-jump from secondary character to secondary character—though i think calling them ""secondary characters"" is being generous; they're more like throwaway characters—spending brief, vignette-like interludes with hollywood caricatures who have no time to make any kind of lasting impression on readers. these filler sections are typically around 1-3 pages long and are characterized by washed up celebrities who are either a.) extremely horny, b.) looking to find their ""true love,"" or c.) some combination thereof. i can see that reid was attempting to humanize or at least fill up the party nina throws through these odd perspective shifts. and yet, rarely does the choice to inhabit secondary characters' heads pay off for writers. here, it is a spectacular failure. time that should gone to the riva siblings and their far more interesting chafing and tenderness is thrown away on...what...? censored threesomes? scummy movie stars groping women and getting away with it? in what world does a three page chapter outlining a celebrity's fictional film successes take precedence over actual plot and main character development? in malibu rising's second half, there are at least eighteen characters whose heads we're flitting to and from. yes, i counted. at times, these shifts aren't even marked by new chapters or sections. sometimes a perspective leap takes place over a single paragraph, in a fleeting interjection from one character before we melt back into whoever the book has decided is the main show for the moment. of over twenty badly written characters, i liked a total of two. nina and kit, one of which i was pleased to accurately predict was—spoiler—gay. the other pissed me off up until around the 80% mark, before her character development really kicked in and i finally breathed a sigh of relief. even still, the way the novel fought tooth and nail to try to convince us that mick is a complex man right up until the bitter end made this experience decidedly hair-pulling. if malibu rising wanted a morally grey character, the book did a terrible job characterizing him as such. he was unambiguously awful from start to finish. so throwing in lines like, “‘i think he’s an asshole. but i can’t be sure. i don’t actually know him well enough to say,’” from his own permanently traumatized child after we’ve spent 350+ pages watching him abandon his blood to live without either parent or even a stable income is more than a little patronizing. i mean, come on. can the novel have some backbone? this book gets one star from me because it didn’t check off any major components from my informal list and because i experienced not one ounce of personal enjoyment over the course of this harrowing journey. i wanted to rage-quit this book like a video game with bad graphics and worse writing more times than i can count. questions like, what do men have? fueled me for nearly 400 pages, all so i could give an answer i already, deep in my heart of hearts, knew: the audacity.if i had to sum up my feelings on this book using one of its own quotes, it would have to be...
“tarine shook her head. […] ‘you people are revolting.’”

What makes a book a great book? Is it writing? Is it the premise? Is it the characters? Or is it the author's voice? I don't know but I can tell you, I thought the Malibu Rising checked all the boxes above. It was superb!I had so much fun with the multiple storylines which is weird because usually I’m against too many characters moving around all over the place. Nevertheless, in this case, it completely worked for me. Let's meet the Rivas:Mick Rivas, the father, an unfaithful man, a famous rock star. A sperm donor who has four children and a trail of ex-wives and broken hearts.Nina, the oldest daughter. A supermodel. The one who made all the sacrifices for her siblings. The one that took over their care without thinking about herself. Her husband left her and she is not even sure how is she going to deal with the upcoming party.Hud, the surfer photographer who's keeping a big secret from his brother, Jay.Jay, the well-known surfer who has a secret of his own. Kitt, the youngest daughter. The road to self-discovery has began, What better way to do it than during the famous Rivas party.Is the 1980s and everyone wants to go to the party of the year! Everyone and anyone who is someone wants to attend the Rivas party. And what a PARTY it is. There is no invitation. The only condition to be a guest is to know the address. If you do, you can show up and have the time of your life. Or not....Over the years, the Rivas party has become the one event the siblings enjoy together. Yet, this year things are going to be different.I love all the Rivas kids. They had an unbreakable bond and surfing was their glue.Of course, I had a soft spot for Nina.I can't finish my review without mentioning the beautiful cover. I love it. It's perfect for these characters. I already preordered my copy.

2290,5.0,"Looooved, loooved this one, as I do with all of Reid’s novels. Five glorious stars. This one will also go in the top ten books for the year. The depth of characters, their motivations and most importantly the voice, top shelf skill level. The story is about one night, one party in Malibu, a unique idea (not sure anyone else could’ve pulled it off so well). To make it work we had to know the characters intimately before the party starts. There are two interwoven plot lines, the day of the party, we the reader, are taken through hour by hour leading up to the annual soirée. The second story line is the history that motivates the characters, how they got to where they were in life before the party starts. For me this is the only weakness in the structure. The book opens with the more current story, the day of the party which is interesting but then alternates with the history story line. For me the history story line is more engaging. I found myself wanting to be in the historical part, the character-building more than the build-up to the party. There is more conflict and energy. Don’t get me wrong the build-up to the party is great, it’s just over shadowed in greatness. Then as the story timelines grow together it just didn’t matter the great prose and storytelling merged.What carries this book so well is the voice. The story is told in third person, but Reid skips from character point of view to character point of view sometimes even on the same page. The transitions are seamless and gives a wonderful insight to how the characters feel and react. As a reader I loved every member of the family, their trials and tribulations were real, and I related to many of them. That’s what a great writer does, connect with the reader and Reid is a master at it. Marvelous read. Highly recommend.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson Series."
2291,3.0,"In order to not feel completely nauseated...(such a let down book after “Daisy Jones and the Six”)...around half way into this Southern California doozie-eye-rolling novel....I decided it was up to me to turn the tables... and have a little fun. And so I did....( kinda)....But oh dear....”Taylor, I love you...have enjoyed all your previous books....but “Malibu Rising”, is not your best work. It was 1983....Malibu was a place were rich white people lived........home to beaches cradling the crystal blue waves of the Pacific Ocean.“Beach houses are crammed along the side of the highway competing for views, narrow and tall”.  Early mornings, the beach was quiet. It was a glory time of day for serious surfers....There was a small exclusive cove, protected on all three sides by fifty foot cliffs. Technically, the beach was public. But the only people who knew how to get to it were those who had access to private stairs or those willing to hike the jagged coast line and risk high tide. In 1956.... .....a few years before “The Beach Boys” and a few months before “Gidget”—( thank you, Sandra Dee) —surfing was becoming popular among teenagers.  .....we get a little family history (family drama, character profiles) about the Riva family:We get the scoop on June, Mick...and their kids: Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit.  In the 50’s, Malibu was a rural fishing town with only one traffic signal.  ..... The town was coming into its adolescence. Surfers were setting up shop with your tiny shorts, longboards, and bikinis were coming into fashion. June‘s family owned Pacific Fish Restaurant (the oldest surviving offbeat restaurants in Los Angeles today) But....The bulk of this story takes place in 1983....over one long 24-hour day.BEWARE..... THIS IS NOT A DUDE BOOK. It’s woman’s fiction for those who love gossip magazines about celebrities, family drama, and schlocky cringe scenes like the following: “Lara climbed on top of him and began to move, her shirt lifted to expose her breasts, her skirt around her hips. The top of her head kept hitting the ceiling of the truck and Jay, trying so very hard to focus on Lara, couldn’t help but wonder if HUD had fucked Ashley in this truck, just like this. If Ashley‘s head head also hit the ceiling”MY EYES WERE ROLLING. My husband, Paul, had a few good laughs - (we were both reading books - side by side - yesterday, Saturday afternoon (nice lazy day).Paul said....”ok, enough already, read to yourself”. He wasn’t interested in growing bigger boobies from estrogen overload. Maybe Taylor was stoned when she wrote this book....(I don’t think I could blame her if she was)....but there were many pages of ‘bad writing’ and trite stereotyping. The ‘fun’ parts for me were the tidbits visuals of the day ...( laughable to boot):Virginia slims, Marlboro cigarettes, Tab, Jeep’s, Jaguars, Airstream caravans, and Wayfarers classic sunglasses (popular among celebrities) were classic in 1983. So was long brown hair, lightened with lemon juice, slim toned bodies, string bikinis, and tanned skin. Love affairs, and Topsiders were nifty. Crop tops and Daisy Dukes, were stylin....Backyard parties; threesomes with rock stars in the jacuzzi wasn’t shocking....Cigarettes, vodka, tequila, whiskey: booze of all kinds, cocaine, multiple divorces, death, pregnancy, the local surf shop, surfing, ( hot pink surf boards were cool), Tennis stars, pop music stars, Keg parties, actors, models, writers, Directors, even a few Olympians, were apropos to Los Angeles, California. And....‘Lame’, a popular slang saying in 1983 ... was kinda ‘lame’. Honestly, I don’t think I ever remember a book that Taylor Jenkins Reid wrote this bad. But, like I said....I ‘went with it’....I rode the wave....And luckily evacuated in time ....as to not get caught in the coastal cliff fire. Maybe Taylor was hurting and distracted when she wrote this novel, like many of us during the pandemic—So I forgive her —and to be fair ... there were a few tender sweet emotional moments. Taylor Jenkins Reid fans will gobble this book anyway. Great work, mediocre...some of us simply love TJR ( me too). I leave you with one small except: “Every day of your life feels like you’re climbing up a mountain. And then you get there and you stay for a bit. And it’s nice at the top. But then you start sliding down the other side”. Thank you Random House, Netgalley, and Taylor Jenkins Reid  "
2292,3.0,"Malibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins ReidThis is just my third TJR book. I loved Daisy and The Six even though there is very little that I can relate to the rock star life. I have followed music all my life though and my husband follows the background of rock stars and groups so that book was very entertaining to me, especially with the audio version's fantastic production. I also enjoyed the audio version of Evidence of the Affair. In the case of Malibu Rising, which I read rather than listened to, I don't think the audio version would have made a better impression on me. The time is August 1983 and the famous Riva siblings are throwing their annual party. Before we get to the actual party towards the end of the book, we go back to the time when the siblings' parents met. That meeting begins a very dysfunctional relationship with a to-be world famous father who abandons the family at the first sniff of another woman, more than once, and a mother who is physically there but whose abandonment takes the form of perpetual longing for her horrible husband and drinking herself to death due to her self pity. I actually liked this part of the book the best, reading about horrible choices of both parents, either active choices or passive choices, that affect their children's' entire lives. Oldest sibling, Nina, raises her brothers and sister even while her mother is still alive and that responsibility shapes her in ways that cause her to have no sense of self preservation, no sense of caring for her personal space or emotions. All the children have an overwhelming sense of abandonment but they have each other and that sense of belonging is priceless. Each one of the siblings is enormously talented in flashy ways and everyone wants to know them, be with them, be them. Things come to a head as we approach the party and attend the party. All these wealthy, powerful, narcissistic, people mingled in with those who want those things, come together at the party and it's a disgusting affair of debauchery, destruction, drink, drugs, sex, drink, drugs, sex. I didn't belong there, never in person and not by reading a book. Any message in the last part of the story was drowned out by this party, for me. I know a lot of people will enjoy this story and I did enjoy large parts of it. Publication: June 1st 2021Thank you to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine and NetGalley for this ARC."

“Our family histories are simply stories. They are myths we create about the people who came before us, in order to make sense of ourselves.”
I did it again because I loved the idea of how it'd look. And I'm satisfied with the results.If you haven't read it, don't read any further, my review has many spoilers ahead. You've been warned, my friend.Malibu Rising isn't what I was expecting, to be honest. It's a little bit different of what the synopsis told me. (My case)We follow the four kids of the famous and legendary singer, Mick Riva. Nina, the supermodel and surfer. Jay and Hud, a championship surfer and a photographer, and Kit, their little sister. They're famous and recognized in Malibu, and all over the world. It's Nina's big annual party, where all of the famous people attend to be seen, to make out with others, to have fun, to smoke a joint, have sex and to tell the story that they were at the legendary party of Nina Riva. But by morning, the entire house will be consumed by the flames.I was expecting something different from Mick Riva's offspring. I honestly thought that they had grown up being recognized by people, that they had grown up with fame surrounding them or something like that: spoiled kids having the world at their feet, just like Mick. But, I had something different. And I loved it.We have two timelines: the day of the party and Mick and June's story. And at the end, both make sense, they're the same ending basically; it's the explanation of the Riva family. How Mick met June, how they fell in love, how Mick's career began...Anyhow, we have the story of a girl who fell in love with a handsome guy who promised the moon and stars, who was naïve and fell for his smile, who didn't know much about the world, but still, she faced it. Everything the world threw at her, June Riva faced everything, and more.Mick Riva is no new character for those who read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones & The Six. He's a famous and legendary singer, but also a playboy, an asshole who sleeps with everybody's wives and don't give a shit about it. (Here, we got the mention of two characters from Daisy Jones, yai)This means we have a Jenkinsverse™??? Yes, indeed. And it's wonderful and beautiful.Mick married June when she was pregnant and their firstborn was named Nina. Then came Jay and then, Hud, but, my sweet baby Hud wasn't June's son, at least not hers... It was Mick's son and from another girl who went to June's house and put the tiny baby in her arms, leaving with no regrets and no looking back... This broke my heart and then, June promised herself she would raise that baby and love him as much as she loved Nina and Jay. And finally, Kit.It is explained to us Mick's background. I understand him now, but I don't forgive or excuse what he did, his behaviour, attitudes or actions. I felt pity for him at some parts, but most part of the time, I wanted to kick him and yell at him for being a dick.This book is about family, about love and the things we sacrifice for the ones we love. And even those sacrifices are difficult and filled with love and responsability.I honestly admire Nina. She gave up many things after her mother died in order to raise and take care of her siblings, who needed a mother, and whose father abandoned them... twice. Let this be no surprise to you: Mick Riva was an asshole in Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones, but here, his levels of stupidity has no limits.I thought that Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit had grown up knowing what fame is, not starving and fighting for not being take from their home, for being taken away from their older sister, who loved them so much. I swear, I didn't see anything of that coming. It was heartbreaking, magical and full of feelings.The mention of Celia made me cry so much. Also, there is a paragraph that makes reference to my queen and goddess: Evelyn Hugo.I fell in love with each character, and the new ones who appeared too. It was an amazing ride knowing the Riva kids, and also Casey.I loved Nina's love for her siblings, and the fact that she finally realized that she gave up everything, that she never gave time for herself, that she finally stood up and fought for her, got what she wanted. I loved Jay's love for his brother and when he realized that he didn't love Ashley, that he would do anything for his family. I loved Hud so so so much (my fave, ha), he's so soft and caring aND oMG, TAYLOR, PLEASE, LET ME MARRY HIM. I loved Kit's honesty, she's so fucking amazing and how Ricky didn't judge her for being lesbian the moment she confessed it to him, he understood and didn't get mad about it or told anyone.
""He had been so close to the girl he'd always wanted. And now he understood it truly was never going to happen. But that's how life goes, Ricky thought. You don't always get the things you want.""
I laughed, cried and get many feelings for this book. In general, I loved it.The pacing was amazing, the plots, the romance, the characters, the writing. TJR's writing style is something wonderful *chef kiss*. I love it. As aspiring author, I envy her (jk) and admire her way to grab you from the first moment until the very end.She's my favorite author now!I loved when the Riva kids were talking with Mick, being honest with him about all the things they kept for many years, when he abandoned them and their mother.Right where you left me by Taylor Swift suits perfectly to this book, with June, at least. Also, many many many songs by her. I also looked up for many playlists on Spotify (word keys: Malibu Rising). and they were amaZING, JUST LIKE THIS BOOK.Malibu Rising isn't an action book. It barely has some action, but you get trapped by the plots and the two story lines!This book is full with many feelings that leave you wanting for more. And honestly, I wanna know more of Nina, Jay, Hud, Kit and Casey.10000000000000000 stars and my eternal love.Once more, TJR showed me that men are not worth it. :')A section in Spanish to insult because I think I insult better in my native language.Mick, sos un grandísimo bastardo y desgraciado, pinchi pendejo. Quise golpearte demasiadas veces por todo lo que June sufrió, por tu pinche culpa. Me rompió el corazón ver a June tan triste y deprimida, vuelta una alcohólica porque no pudiste mantener a tu amiguito en tus pantalones cada vez que veías a una mujer bonita. Ugh, me cagas. Grandísimo hijo de tu putísima madre, me dolió tanto ver cómo June sufría, y sus hijos con ella. Los hombres son inútiles y todos unos mentirosos, sí.

2296,5.0,"You know that feeling you get when you try something amazing for the first time? For me it was the first time I tasted cheesecake. It’s like I inherently knew that I would never meet a cheesecake I didn’t like, no matter what flavor it featured, and I’d always want another bite.This was my first Taylor Jenkins Reid book, and all I can say is, YUM!! I’m definitely gonna want more of this. Don’t care what flavors, just gimme a bite.The Riva family in this book are fascinating. Iconic singer Mick can’t keep it in his pants, despite his marriage and later remarriage to kind-hearted June, but one good thing that does come out of the marriage is their children: Nina, Jay and later Kit. Added to the mix is Mick’s illegitimate son, Hud, who June lovingly raises as her own. The Riva children, now grown, have never known a life in which Mick was physically present and involved, and by circumstance, now find themselves completely dependent on each other to navigate life. In this situation, they’ve each found ways to survive and thrive.Nina, the oldest, is the responsible one. The caretaker. The comforter. The one who will sacrifice her own desires and dreams to hold her family together. If that means working as a well-paid model in the public eye when she’d really rather have a quiet life surfing, she’ll put everyone else’s needs first.Jay and Hud are brothers from different mothers and are almost like twins, both in age and in their inseparable nature, often traveling together as adventurous Jay pursues surfing professionally and sensitive-natured Hud photographs him for magazines.Kit is the youngest, a no-nonsense girl in the shadow of her beautiful and talented older siblings, but possibly the most talented surfer of the bunch.I love these four. They’re dysfunctional and wounded in their own ways, but wholly committed to one another, and you just always get the sense that no matter what happens in life, they’ll have each others’ backs. I felt so invested in each of them and their well-being. When the story culminates in the infamous Riva party that Nina holds at her place each year getting wildly out of control, those bonds get put to the test as all chaos ensues.The story bounces between the past - the beginnings of Mick and June’s relationship and their relational history, together and apart, and the present (1980’s), showing the current lives of their children. I loved both storylines equally, as each one was compelling in its own way. Additionally, there are no boring characters to be found in this book, and there are a LOT of characters - so many! Some books just resonate with you, and this was one that I connected with. I think there were aspects of the story that I personally related to because of similarities to aspects of my life, but there was also just a tremendous amount of humanity in these characters. They just felt real in a way that I sometimes struggle to find in book characters. I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea: I love this book and highly recommend it!★★★★★ ❤️Thank you to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine for this ARC in exchange for my honest review.

Not me forgetting (the entire time I read this) that this took place in the same universe as Evelyn Hugo!!!!!! I mean it was literally about one of the characters, I'm deeaaaadddd.
This book was basically about rich people having daddy issues who know how to surf and living their best (and worst) lives along side of the ocean. That's it. Good, but not good enough.

2300,5.0,"↠ 4.5 starsIt’s August 27th, 1983, and Malibu burns. Just hours earlier the famed end-of-summer party hosted at the Riva mansion was in full swing, and not a soul knew that it would soon end with Malibu in flames. The Riva siblings have always attracted attention, having made a name for themselves in the surfing world, and being the children of legendary singer Mick Riva. The end-of-summer party is tradition, yet the only one not looking forward to it is Nina, the eldest of the four. After being abandoned by her pro-tennis player husband, Nina longs to escape the gravity of the spotlight, if only for a short while. Inseparable brothers Jay and Hud are on a collision course for a confession that could ruin their entire relationship, and youngest Kit harbors a secret, a guest she invited without consulting anyone. Over the course of just one night, the party of the summer will take a turn into the slow unraveling of a family tethered together for generations.Taylor Jenkins Reid is back at it again with Malibu Rising, a book that is shaping up to be the beach read of the summer and sure to leave readers with more than a few burns. This evocative novel spans generations in the lives of one family, proving once again its author's talent for crafting powerful historical narratives across alternating timelines. Where her previous novels felt slowly drawn out, Malibu Rising turns that on its head, dropping readers headfirst into the chaos of a night that changed everything for one family. Following each member of the Riva siblings throughout the day, and chronicling the lives of previous generations, Reid creates an intricate tapestry of legacy contrasted against a search for freedom from the past. True to her writing style, Malibu Rising is heavy on the characters, and light on all other aspects — something I have loved about her works in the past. Reid has always had the ability to provide readers with as much stake in the game as her own characters, and that is evident from the way that the novel was structured. Malibu Rising brings readers into the fold right at the very end and works backward to fan the flames that will inevitably spark and light Malibu ablaze. This flipped narrative interspersed with generational flashbacks only made the characters stronger, heightened the already brimming tensions, and placed more uncertainty upon the reader's shoulders. With her incredible talent for storytelling, it’s no wonder that this was a hit for me. Taylor Jenkins Reid first captured my attention with The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and will continue to do so for many years to come. In Malibu Rising, one night truly does change everything, and together one family will begin to separate themselves from the things that they wish to leave behind and hold tight to all that they can accomplish together.Trigger warnings: drugs, alcohol consumption, death of a loved one, grief, parental abandonment, infidelity, stroke"
2301,4.0,"When it comes to Taylor Jenkins Reid, there are fans that are B.E. and A.E., as in Before Evelyn or After Evelyn. I am straight up B.E., because I fell in love with the author’s contemporary fiction before the publication of The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo that took her not only into historical fiction territory but also into the mainstream. Oh how I hope she returns to her B.E. style one day soon, but in the meantime, here’s a glimpse into my thought process regarding her latest novel, Malibu Rising: - TJR has a new book! TJR has a new book! Gimme it!- Ah man, it’s historical fiction not contemporary romance. Bummer.- But a large part is set in the ‘80s! Amidst the So. Cal. surfing culture. Gnarly! Let me bust out my Ocean Pacific t-shirt and grab a Bartles & Jaymes lemon sunset cooler. - Okay so we’ve got a family of 4 siblings who have a famous Dad and are each a bit famous in their own way. Kinda like the Kardasians of the pre-Insta world??? - So they’re just having a big rager of a party? Not sure I’m going to care about the storyline here. - This is feeling like it might be my first 3-star TJR read. :(- Wait, it’s almost over already? Well those 380 pages certainly flew by.- And I actually really cared about these characters! How did that happen? - Oh right, it was written by Taylor Jenkins Reid. Of course her writing and depth are going to elevate a book that might have been ordinary in a lesser author’s hands. - Let me sleep on it before writing my review. 3.5 or 4 stars??? Hmmm. Zzz.- 4 stars!While Malibu Rising probably won’t rise to the top of my 2021 reading list, I still recommend it as a great summer indulgence. Just dive in with no expectations and ride the wave of TJR’s skillful storytelling. Blog: https://www.confettibookshelf.com/"
2302,3.0,"Be sure to visit Bantering Books to read all my latest reviews.3.5 starsThe Rivas sure know how to throw one heck of a party. And Taylor Jenkins Reid sure knows how to write one heck of a book.Usually. Malibu Rising, TJR’s follow-up to her bestselling novels, Daisy Jones & The Six and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, is all sand and surf. Set in 1983, the story revolves around a day in the lives of the Riva siblings – Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit – as they prepare for Nina’s infamous end-of-summer party. The annual event is the hottest invitation in Malibu, as everyone vies to be near the famous progeny of renowned singer, Mick Riva. (Yes, the same Mick Riva who was once married to Evelyn Hugo. Just in case you’re wondering.)I consider myself to be a huge TJR fan, and I loved both Daisy Jones and Evelyn Hugo just as much as the masses. She has a remarkable knack for writing glitzy celebrity soap operas, making them incredibly fun to read, yet poignant and wise. Her insight into the intricacies of the human heart is unparalleled, and she has never allowed the sex, drugs, and rock ‘n’ roll of her stories to overshadow their emotional wallop.Until now.Sex sells – as do drugs and rock ‘n’ roll. It’s an age-old adage for a reason. But that’s not why I read TJR. I read her novels for the unforgettable characters. The life-altering journeys. The sage observations on life and love. And in Malibu Rising, it’s all lost, buried beneath the sand of endless sexual encounters and wild, drug-induced party antics. The novel’s scandalous nature feels forced and excessive, as if this time around, TJR is striving for shock rather than heart. And it saddens me that the Riva family’s story is squandered. Because the four siblings are magnetic and relatable, and their narrative arcs could’ve been exceptionally powerful. Malibu Rising is good. But it’s not great. And it’s certainly not TJR at her best.My sincerest appreciation to Taylor Jenkins Reid, Ballantine Books, and NetGalley for the Advance Review Copy. All opinions included herein are my own.

2303,3.0,(3.5?) Good family drama/historical fiction book again from this author.I think I've hit my quota of sad stories for a while though.
2304,2.0,"*Now available in the UK*A tale of riches, excess, family and betrayalMalibu Rising tells the story of the Riva family, from the 1950's, when June and Mick first met and fell in love, to the 1980's, when their children are grown, and having their annual party.Let's just say that I didn't burn for this one...🔥It's no secret that I struggled with this, and it probably would have been a DNF, if it wasn't an ARC, but I soldiered on, determined not to squander my luck at getting a TJR ARC! I am pretty upset that I didn't like this, as I am a fan of this author, previously loving Evidence of the Affair and Daisy Jones & The Six, and also enjoying Maybe in Another Life, but I found this one quite tedious!There were pacing issues for me, as the first 60% was very slow and boring. The third person omniscient writing style kept me at arms length, so I felt detached, and had no real connection to any of the characters. It felt oddly impersonal, as if I was reading about someone else telling me these character's story, rather than the characters themselves? There was also so much filler! There was a huge amount of descriptions about what the characters were wearing for example, which felt shallow to me.Then at abut the 70% mark, the pace suddenly picked up, and the story became more dramatic, drawing me in, only to find that there were many new POVs, from guests at the big party. This felt like an odd choice to me, so far into the story, and I found that I cared even less about these characters and what they did or thought! Much like a soap opera, the party was full of trashy, clichéd Hollywood stereotypes. I wasn't surprised at the destruction, the name dropping of made up and real celebrities, and the vapid narcissistic guests, but did feel like we were building to something dramatic.The characters had a lack of development, and didn't feel fully fleshed out to me. We actually missed a huge chunk of the Riva children's lives. Nina, the main character was so bland and dull, she irritated me until right near the end, when she finally had a bit of character growth. The sexual harassment she put up with turned my stomach! Hud and Jay were both ok, and I did like their brotherly bond. June was hard to read about with her alcoholism, and the fact that her whole character and worth was based around her husband. Both her life and death felt meh. Mick Riva, was quite obviously written to be unlikeable, as he was a selfish, self obsessed, unfaithful, weak man, but I didn't want him to return near the end, and did not appreciate his attempt at a redemption arc. He was a P.O.S and a waste of space. Kit, the youngest Riva, was the most likeable, being a no nonsense kind of girl , just discovering herself, but I felt that storyline could've been explored more. I did appreciate the bond that the siblings had, how they supported each other and had each other's backs. They were dealt a crappy hand. Really though, I couldn't bring myself to care much about what happened to any of them!Although, I could feel a build up to a dramatic and devastating climax, it actually fizzled out in an anticlimactic and flat manner.What I was expecting:What I got:Overall, I found this book lacklustre, predictable, over the top and forgettable, but I am definitely in the minority here! My unpopular little opinion is that this isn't TJR at her best, it just lacks the magic of her other books, but with a 4.29 average rating, it is likely that most people may like it, and I sincerely hope that you do like it more than I did! Many have enjoyed this beachy read, so maybe head over to Malibu to see what you think for yourselves! 🏄‍♀️🏄‍♀️Many thanks to NetGalley UK and Random House UK, Cornerstone for my ARC, in exchange for my honest opinion."
2305,4.0,"3.5 starsThis was probably my most anticipated book of the year and I'm really sad I didn't love this the way I thought I would. This is a beautiful story about a family coming of age and figuring out who you are and growing up. I love that its set in Malibu in the 80's, the beach vibes were immaculate. But to be honest I found most of this book to be so boring. I didn't care for Mick or June as characters and I was really bored by their flashback chapters. I was really invested in the four siblings though, and my favorite two were the sisters Nina and Kit. The last 150 pages or so were really solid in my opinion and definitely the most entertaining part of the book. It's when all the family drama comes to a head and some really great conversations happen and it really gives the characters a chance to shine. I loved Nina, she reminded me of Fiona from Shameless. This isn't a bad book, I think I just had way too high of expectations. This also reminded me a lot of Little Fires Everywhere too, especially with the prologue and the way we follow four siblings. It had those vibes for sure. Reading vlog where I read it: https://youtu.be/IBmz8kzf7DY"
2306,2.0,2.5this was such a let down 
2307,4.0,There is something about Taylor Jenkins Reid’s writing that just draws you in. She tells a story so different than anyone else. You are instantly there in California with the sun shining down and sand between your toes.A party is about to take place. No invitations. Anyone who knows the date and address is welcome. Come one...come all. Only this party may just get a bit out of hand. Four siblings have grown up in the shadows of their famous father Mick Riva. . Their life hasn’t been easy. And though the world may know and love him. His own children had little idea of who he was. The eldest daughter Nina has put her own life aside to do what’s right for the family and make sure everyone is raised with love. Will she have a chance to find her own happiness? Tonight’s party may leave the family closer than ever or shattered beyond repair. You will have to attend to find out. I listened to this authors previous book Daisy Jones And The Six last year and it changed me completely for audio! All this time later I still can’t stop thinking about it. And though I didn’t enjoy this book quite as much it is still staying with me and I find myself thinking about all the time. Isn’t that what we all want when we read a book? That lasting impression.A buddy read with Susanne!Posted to: https://books-are-a-girls-best-friend...Thank you to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine.
2308,4.0,"NOW AVAILABLE!!!this is the second book i have read by taylor jenkins reid, and while her books may not be literary-award great, they are great fun—fast-paced and frothy, but underneath the pure escapist pleasure of them are layers with real emotional texture.this one is similar to Daisy Jones & The Six in a bunch of ways—the dual shiny/pointy nature of fame with its various perks and temptations, female characters whose raw talents are sidelined or overshadowed by the media's fixation on their sex appeal & relationships, the unsuitability of musicians as romantic partners, etc etc.but this one is set in the eighties!i keed, i keed—the differences outweigh the similarities, and this is a far more immersive and satisfying read than Daisy Jones & The Six. it's not without its flaws, but the parts that i liked i liked a LOT. the novel unfolds over the 24 hours making up august 27, 1983; the day the four rivas siblings will host their annual end-of-summer party, which we are told right from the first page is going to end in literal flames that'll burn the whole damn place to the ground before spreading down the entire malibu coastline. so we know what’s gonna happen, and if we’re paying attention, we know who’s responsible for the fire pretty early on, but this isn’t a mystery novel (if it was, it would be an investigation into the mystery of why people throw parties because even before all the property damage starts, this party sounds terrible) having told you right off the bat how it'll end, the book can then take its time getting there, a slow temporal striptease doled out in one-hour intervals—each chapter covers a single hour of the day, but it also dips back into the past providing roughly thirty years of backstory about the rivas family.long story short is: boy meets girl, boy becomes a famous singer and can’t hack the monogamous family man thing very long, leaving his wife and four kids behind to ride the MICK RIVAS fame and fortune train, never contacting them or sending a dime their way. so june moms up, raising her children beautifully on her own until her demons force her oldest daughter nina to sister up and take care of jay, hud, and kit on her own, their lives shaped by sacrifice and disappointing men; being let down by unreliable fathers and husbands and seeing life’s early promises derailed. not so much for mick. he gets to have all the toys. anyway, the siblings grow up living in the shadow of fame cast by a father they barely remember, rise from their humble beginnings into their own successes and their own fame, all beautiful, unusually close-knit and down-to-earth; their lives filled with surfing and tennis and golden california sunshine, and every year they throw a party. over the years, this party acquires a reputation as the Event at which to be seen, attracting celebrities (actual and made-up famous people) and leechy hangers-on as well as everyday local folks and every year it gets a little bigger and a little more out of hand: bigger names, harder drugs, worse behavior.to be honest, character-wise i was really only invested in june and, to a lesser extent, nina. kit could have been one of the most interesting characters: the baby of the family too-often treated like a baby, desperate to prove herself equal to her older, more accomplished siblings, discovering who she is and what she wants out of her life on her own terms, but she was a little one-dimensional on the page, which was kind of a let-down. the story gets a little haphazard, particularly towards the end where POV shifts rapidly as the story winds to a close and the party builds to a nightmare, flitting from character to character, many of them sideline people crammed into the party and the narrative—where some of them are or will become significant but others are just taking up space. the ending is very montage-y—which i liked and where—yes—many of those brief interludes with rando guests pay off, but the whole energy of the end is a little distracting and frenetic. which is meant to mirror the energy of the party, but still. for the most part, though, it's an enjoyable and frequently poignant look at family and legacy and love; at what we give up, or what we refuse to give up, when all of those things collide. good for beach reading, good for snow days and probably rainy spring or fall days, too. don't get bossed around by the weather! ***************************************feels like a good snow day kinda bookreview to come!come to my blog!"
2309,5.0,i will literally pay taylor jenkins reid to keep writing books every year. i won't truly be alive until this book is out and in my hands.
2310,3.0,"I started reading Taylor Jenkins Reid about 6 years ago...before she was a household name, and the stories of Emma (One True Loves), Lauren (After I do) and Hannah (Maybe in Another Life) are still MY personal favorites because those stories resonated with me. TJR’s latest three, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, Daisy Jones and the Six, and now Malibu Rising have not. (I KNOW! The first two are EVERYONE else’s favorites!) I am just not a person who becomes star struck by Movie Icons, Rock Stars or other FAMOUS people, and reading about their lifestyles of sex, drugs, rock and roll and fashion simply doesn’t appeal to me. NOT in real life or in books. So, this latest tale of Legendary Singer Mick Riva and his offspring just didn’t quite do it for me! It was fine, just not a book that stands out. This family saga tells the love story of Mick and his first wife, June before he was famous and the temptations on the road became too great, and the four children that June raised for about 50% of the book. And, the second half tells the story of their last epic Summer Beach Party, in August 1983, when one of Malibu’s devastating fires began at 28150 Cliffside Drive-Nina Riva’s cliffside mansion, set by a particular person whose “nature was to set fires and walk away....” 🔥If you enjoy watching award shows to see who will show up, what they will be wearing and who they bring as dates, then this glimpse into the Hollywood lifestyle MAY be more to your liking than it was to mine. I would rather be reading a book in sweats! I am sure I will be in the minority again! (Sigh)Available June 1, 2021Thank You to Ballantine Books for my gifted copy! It was my pleasure to provide a candid review!"
2312,4.0,"Taylor Jenkins Reid's latest offering is a dysfunctional family drama that revolves around the Riva clan, the tragedies, trauma, celebrity and surfing set in Malibu and the twenty four hours, the famous, drug and alcohol fuelled end of summer party in August 1983. In a story that shifts from the past and present, we learn of the intricacies of the painful relationship between iconic rock star Mick Riva, a character that will be familiar to those who have read the author's other books, and June, a June whose life revolved around Mick, despite everything he does to her, and the never ending betrayals. Siblings Nina Riva, brothers Jay and Hud, and Kitt, the youngest, have strong bonds with each other, a crucial rock as their father, Mick, had little to do with them as they grew up. Their lives are destined to irrevocably change as their personal histories and secrets are revealed as the party ends up going up in flames.Nina is the eldest, a supermodel and surfer, is the one that held the family together, shouldering the burdens of responsibility, the one willing to pay the personal cost of doing so. Her marriage to husband Brandon has fallen apart, he has been cheating on her, in an echo of their family history. They are all messed up in their own ways, Jay is a surfer, and his illegitimate brother, Hud is a surfer photographer, whilst Kitt has her own issues as the party becomes ever more chaotic and wild. This is not my favourite book by the author, but I found it a light and entertaining read, an enjoyable emotional roller coaster of a family melodrama, with colourful and vibrant characters, that many of Taylor Jenkins Reid's fans will adore. Many thanks to Random House Cornerstone for an ARC."
2313,4.0,"Christmas came early for me this year, in the form of TJR’s latest novel. Every year in Malibu, Nina Riva throws an annual end of Summer party. For anyone who is anyone, this is THE party to be seen at. Who wouldn’t want to party with the famous Riva family?Nina is a famous surfer model. Her brother, Jay, is a highly talented and award-winning surfer. Her other brother, Hud, is a well known photographer. Then there is her youngest sibling, Kit, the sister everyone loves. The year is 1983, and Nina is not looking forward to the party. She just got dumped by her cheating husband, and the whole world knows about it. Still, the party must go on. Each chapter unveils family secrets as each hour gets closer to the party. Intertwined with those are flashback scenes involving the Rivas’ parents: June Riva, and the famous Mick Riva. If Mick’s name sounds familiar, it is because he is one of Evelyn Hugo’s 7 husbands (although that ended in annulment). These flashback scenes describe how they met and ultimately married and had children, while his singing career (and other indulgences) took him away from his family. In the present, the party becomes OOC as the guests lose inhibition, courtesy of alcohol and drugs. One thing is for certain: This will be a night that nobody will soon forget. This year was all about TJR for me. I read all of her books (in reverse order) and was thrilled to receive an advanced copy of this one. Can we talk about her writing? It’s phenomenal, as always. She writes in the most genuine style that really makes me feel like I am in the plot of her books. She has a delicate way of revealing intricacies between her characters. No exception here. While I enjoyed reading about ALL of the Riva family, the scenes that resonated the most for me were the ones in the past...the relationship between June and Mick and everything leading up to the present day. These sections were so touching and emotional. The party itself was interesting, but I had a hard time imagining that Nina and family would allow the guests to behave in the destructive manner that they did. My anxiety and need to clean would have been at fever pitch! All in all, this is another superb read that continues to cement my love for the author. While it doesn’t quite live up to DAISY JONES AND THE SIX or THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO, it is nonetheless an engrossing read, and I am certain many others will enjoy it too.

2315,5.0,"Don’t you love it when a book you’ve been dying to read by one of your favorite authors lives up to the hype? That's how I feel about 
Malibu Rising
, the upcoming book by Taylor Jenkins Reid.It’s 1983. Superstar model Nina Riva and her siblings—surfing all-star Jay, talented photographer Hud, and Kit, the youngest, who’s ready to be taken seriously as a woman and a surfer—are getting ready to have their annual party at the end of the summer. Once again this year the party is at the Malibu mansion Nina was sharing with her tennis-star husband, although he recently left her.The Riva party always promises to be the craziest, most epic event. You never know what celebrities you’ll see there—and what they’ll be doing. But Nina’s heart isn’t in it this year, although she’s doing it for her siblings—a role she’s played for a number of years now.As preparations for the party roll into full swing, each Riva is trying to figure out how to unburden themselves of a secret or a wish they’ve been hiding. When all are revealed, it’s just going to be one aspect of a party—and a night—that will change their lives immensely.I like a book that teases at one thing that’s going to happen and then builds the tension toward that incident the whole story. In this case, the story alternates between preparations for the party and the story of how the Riva siblings’ mother met their father, Mick, who became a music legend. The book then follows their childhood.Taylor Jenkins Reid is one of the best storytellers I know. I really enjoyed these characters and honestly wouldn’t have minded if the book were longer because I would have loved to have gotten to know more about what their futures held. The party is crazy and melodramatic and there’s a lot to follow, but the core of the story—family, loyalty, love, desire—just blew me away.There's one of her older books I haven’t read yet and I may hold on to it for a while so I have something of hers left to read!!Goodreads, Random House, and Ballantine Books provided me with a complimentary advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review. Thanks for making it available!

And how that single night can change the lives of the Riva siblings for better and for worse.......This is my third book by TJR. And it was very good! Ima a huge fan of Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones and I loved the references here and there! Since I loved this book, Im now on a TJR spree lol.WritingWhen there is only you, you do not get to choose which jobs you want, you do not get to decide you are incapable of anything.She knew that she could not sustain her life fueled only by the memories of those she once loved. Loss would not propel her forward. She had to go out and live. She had to find new people.The author has such a unique and beautiful style of writing. The way she effortlessly navigates between the past, present and the future is MINDBLOWING.Too much self-sufficiency was sort of mean to the people who loved you, Kit thought. You robbed them of how good it feels to give, of their sense of value.The one thing that can make a story better is the writing. The beautiful writing here added to that floaty feel and magical beach-y vibes to the book! I'm in love with it🥰Im super excited to read Maybe in Another LifeWorldThere isn't exactly a world-building bcz its contemporary. But the small references to The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo Mick married again, shortly after he divorced Veronica. The biggest star in Hollywood. It was a huge scandal, the talk of the town when they had it annulled the next day.made me tear up because I started to think about the ending of Evelyn Hugo!I loved how the three books were interconnected.

2317,2.0,"TW: alcoholism; death of a parentI sadly did not enjoy this book as much as the first two I read by this author. Firstly, this felt like two separate stories. The first part is mainly flashbacks to the main characters childhoods and crappy parenting situations. The second part is the actual party and has us following way too many characters to keep track of in such a short time. That made it difficult for me to attach to any of the characters and I think they will be largely forgettable. I would have preferred if more of the book was about the party based on the synopsis and then we would have had more time to flesh out all those little stories and interactions. Lastly, the ending wrapped up way too quickly and perfectly. I typically enjoy this author’s flawed characters, but she tried to cram too many characters and stories into this one which resulted in a mess for me. "
2318,5.0,"i cant even be surprised anymore. i mean it’s taylor jenkins reid. ughh this had no business being that good. the writing, the plot, the characters all 10/10. the best part about this book was the authenticity of it. real life problems dealt in real life ways. not over romanticized or unrealistic conclusions. this book is beautiful, emotion, and heart jerking! literally there was so much ache in this book my heart plummeted.(but like in a good way) these characters have really been through it, and we get to see that throughout the whole book. the way these siblings love one another-no matter what the situation is-they’ll have each other’s back. i’m envious but also so happy for them.i finished this book with a big smile on my face. this is the type of book that will have you thinking about it for days.

2320,4.0,"4.5⭐I really enjoyed Malibu Rising. I smiled, laughed, and wept on my lawn mower, I hope the neighbors weren't looking. There are so many books with California setting so when this book came out, I wasn't excited with ""Malibu"" in the title. But this was nice!! Parts of the story are from the 1950s and I love the way TJR describes how Malibu was - modest ranches and middle-class neighborhoods, the era before mega-mansions. Then the 70s, and 80s.I love the Rivas, June (mother), and the children in particular. I truly enjoy their stories up until the party. This is so close to 5 stars for me. Strong women string this fine story together. It's a blessing that I never encounter a Mick or a Brandon in real life.The audio with Julia Whelan makes a fantastic listening experience. I got a CD set for a friend and hope she loves it. If you haven't read TJR before but like Elin Hilderbrand, or Nora Robert's contemporary stories, this book is worth checking out.🏄‍♀️🌴"

2322,4.0,"This is literally the beachy read but not one of the typical fare.Jenkins Reid has a flare for making a story read light but have a comfy level of depth to her characters and story.Malibu rising is an analogy for the quiet place Malibu was in the 50’s to the epitome of wealth and development in the late 70’s early 80’s; as well as the wildfires that consumed it and destroyed it over the decades - a recurrent cycle of devastation and reinvention. This is a story of siblings. Of abandonment by a father whose singing career took off as he followed. He returned once more and broke their mom’s heart again and left them in poverty.Nina, the oldest, was the one who held it together to make a family for herself and 3 siblings.The story is told in parallel timelines in the first half. June, the mom’s story, and into the 70’s and 80’s with Nina and her own claim to fame.The 2nd half is the 24 hours leading into the famous Riva end of summer party, where anyone who is someone will be there. Where truths are revealed in the cacophony of a party unleashed.The ending, let’s just say, it was beautifully summed up with with a nescient flick.4✮I have to move up the seven husbands of evelyn hugo"
2323,4.0,"""Malibu Rising"" by Taylor Jenkins Reid is a family story!The Riva Siblings know how to throw a Malibu party! No invitations! EVER! But, if you know the address, you're cordially invited to attend this annual 'end of summer' event!The Riva Siblings:- Nina: Oldest. Famous surfer. Supermodel.- Jay: Oldest brother. Award winning, championship surfer.- Hud: Second son. Talented, well known photographer.- Kit: Youngest. Talented surfer. Ready to carve her own path.There are two distinct timelines:- The August 1983 Party.- 'Everything' that comes before the party starts!It begins with the story of their parents, Mick and June Riva. How they met, their marriage and the beginning of Mick's career as a famous singer. Sharing anything else would definitely spoil it for you! You don't need to know about it beforehand, you just need to read this book!You know what else? It's not the party that I enjoyed the most. It's the story of the Riva Family that's the best part of this book. The party? It felt superfluous and way too Hollywood!This is a family of siblings who take care of one another. Who love each other, stand together and stick together. It's a family that could be living in Austen TX, Milwaukee WI, Spokane WA or anywhere. They didn't even look like a Hollywood family. They were just a family.I'm a TJR fan slowly making my way through all of her books, so obviously I love her writing and innovative story lines. For this one, I listened to the audiobook and narrator Julia Whelan made it a memorable experience. It was a great choice for me.I highly recommend this book because I keep thinking about it, smiling about it and that ending was the best! That's not a spoiler, is it? "

(hide spoiler)]____________________________Men were bullshit— people were bullshit—and Nina was not going to live through bullshit while wearing high heels a single second longer.TJR hates men and that is confirmed. I have read 3 books by her and this is that I have gathered from her book- men are cheating assholes who do nothing but lie. And I'm not saying this. She said her. The way she writes about men is something I hate. Also I hate the men written by her. If Mick Riva suddenly disappears then you know what happened to him. They are all talented and smart and good—and, sure, we’re not perfect. But we have integrity. We know something about loyalty. We are there for each other.I loved the Riva siblings. Every single one of them including Hud too. I wish I had a elder sister like her. My elder sister after reading this: ""what am I? A potato?"". But like seriously I would exchange my sister with Nina. She became responsible for 3 teenagers when she was a teenager too. I can only guess the pressure on her shoulders. The best thing about this book was how the siblings never ignored each other and helped Nina. The story of June and Mick Riva seemed like a tragedy to their oldest child, Nina. It felt like a comedy of errors to their first son, Jay. It was an origin story for their second son, Hud. And a mystery to the baby of the family, Kit. To Mick himself it was just a chapter of his memoir.In the beginning I loved June so much but then as the book progressed I started hating her. Not because she became an alcoholic, but because the way she still hoped for Mick to return and how she started neglecting her duties as a mother. Losing your mind over a man would be the worst thing to lose your mind over. I understand losing your mind over your your job or over your studies or maybe over some books that shouldn't even exist. But this... I hate her for this. “All right,” Mick said. “I believe this is my cue to leave.” He entertained the fantasy that someone might try to stop him. He wasn’t too surprised when no one did.You know I can write a book about why I hate Mick Riva and it wouldn't be enough. I hate him so much. I want TJR to write a book named ""THE SIX WIVES OF MICK RIVA"" and fill it with hate as much as possible. And maybe that would be my first book by her which I'll rate 5 stars. But until then I don't think I'm gonna read any more books by her.Buddy Read with my amazing friends Ananya, Bhavya, Maple and Nashita ❤."
2326,5.0,"I became totally immersed in this saga of the famous Riva family, set amongst the homes of the rich and powerful in Malibu. It’s skilfully told over the course of one very eventful day, leading up to Nina Riva’s legendary annual summer party. THE party to be seen at – no invitations; just knowing her address is enough to show up and the rich and famous from all walks of life show up in droves.When June, daughter of a couple who ran a beachside seafood café, met Mick Riva, an up and coming singer, she knew he was the one for her and had dreams of a perfect life raising their family in house next to the beach. Mick truly loved June but he loved the excitement of chasing other women and after he left the family twice, June was left to raise the kids on her own. Which she did, working in the family restaurant and loving them as much as she could. But the pain of losing Mick hurt so much only alcohol could dull the pain and eventually kill her, leaving eighteen year old Nina to pick up the baton, leave school and raise her three younger siblings. Now seven years later Nina is a famous surfing model, her brothers Jay a professional surfer on the world circuit and Hud, a surf photographer with the youngest, Kit in college.I really liked Nina and her siblings. They’ve grown up knowing the value of hard work and looking out for each other. Nina has been so selfless in taking care of them all that she’s never had time for herself to really work out who she is and what she wants. Her marriage has gone the same way as her mother’s with her tennis star husband chasing other women and she loathes the house he bought them overlooking the beach. However, she does love the beach below the house, where the siblings can occasionally surf together as a group. I also loved the metaphor of fire and rebirth in this novel. The siblings have secrets from each other, ones that will affect the directions of their lives, which all come to a head during the party. A party that ignites, burning totally out of control with excessive drugs, sex and destruction. An uninvited guest will be the catalyst for Nina and her siblings to realise what it is they really want from life."
2327,4.0,"""Ain't no party like a West Coast party'Cause a West Coast party don't stop"" - CoolioTrue to form, Nina Riva's party was a west coast party that you do not get an invitation for. If you know about it, you show up. It is a wild party, and it will not stop until it all goes up in flames!!!!Malibu: August 1983. The Riva siblings are well known in Malibu (and in other parts of the world). Nina, the oldest and host of the end of summer party, is a supermodel and surfer. She is also the glue which holds her family together. Jay is a championship surfer and Hud is a renowned photographer. Kit is the youngest and a surfer. Their father is the famous singer Mick Riva, an unfaithful husband and absentee father.Everyone is looking forward to the party but Nina. She has her reasons but goes through the motions. Over the course of the day, readers learn about each sibling, their past and the present. We learn about their passions, their relationships, and their secrets. We know Nina's husband left her for another woman. Jay has a secret and hopes a certain woman will show up to the party. Hud has a secret himself and knows it will not go over well. Not to be left out, Kit also has a secret. She has invited someone to the party without telling her siblings. It is California and you know it is going to get HOT! The party is going to be the party of the season!A lot is covered in this book, not only the day in the life of these siblings but also their history. Their mother and father, the beach, even Malibu itself shaped them into who they are today. They have baggage. They also have a tight bond and survival instincts. In 384 pages, Taylor Jenkins Reid has told their life story. Not only did I learn about the siblings’ collective stories, but I learned the story of their parents as well. This is no small feat. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a gifted storyteller who weaves her magic though the book and all the subplots. The beginning was a little slow for me, but I did not mind as I was being introduced to the characters. But things picked up and by the fifty percent mark, I was drawn in and did not want to put the book down. Then the book became pure magic.Another breathtaking winner by Reid. Although the beach and party are the backdrop, this book is about family, love, responsibility and taking control of your life. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it had me reminiscing about all the time I spent in Malibu, the beach, the lazy summer days, the heat, the parties, and the fires. A tantalizing book to read this summer!Thank you to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine and NetGalley who provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

2328,4.0,"4.5 starsYou can add me to the fan club for this book! For those who love a good character study type of book, this one is right up your alley. For those who really need a big event, or twist, or some suspense, then you should probably avoid this because it has none of those things.That said, man did I love this! Who did I enjoy the most in this family? June, the way too understanding wife but kind of terrible mother, no matter how much she loved her children? Nina, the glue that held the family together even though she also was the biggest doormat in her personal life? Hud and Jay, the brothers who are inseparable until they suddenly are? Kit, the youngest but also toughest of the bunch? Mick, the guy you love to hate? The answer: I loved all of them.The only reason why I didn't round this up to 5 stars is this: the secondary characters were not nearly as well developed. Once the party started, I would get annoyed every time a new POV showed up about some characters who I didn't care about and could not keep track of. I just wanted it to go back to the Riva family ASAP. I think the book should have been pared down to remove some of those - it would have cost nothing to the real plot.So yeah, loving this, love this author (check out her other books! I recommend The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones & The Six)."
2329,4.0,"I adored Daisy Jones and the Six, so I was dying to see what Taylor Jenkins Reid would write next. I enjoyed this, but I didn’t love it the way I did Daisy. Malibu Rising is the story of a famous family - a bathing suit model, a professional surfer, the photographer brother and the baby sister, still in college. The book takes place over the course of 24 hours, with flashbacks to both their parents’ lives, the father, a famous singer, and their childhood. “Our parents live inside us, whether they stick around or not.”It took me a while to get a feel for these siblings. But I grew to appreciate the points TJR made. Nina fights to be seen as more than just her body as companies use her sexuality as a commodity. These are kids that were abandoned, either physically or mentally, that had to grow up well before they should have. The book stresses what it truly means to be a family, and what it means to be responsible. There’s a lot going on here - hidden health problems, secret loves. It’s all set against the big party. TJR did a great job with the party scene - the mix of all those characters, all their plans, desires and insecurities. All the stars who are just such total a**holes. And at the end, how everything goes so totally wrong. If what you want is a beach read, this will fit the bill. It’s a fun, easy read, but I doubt I’ll remember it a month from now. My thanks to NetGalley and Random House - Ballantine for an advance copy of this book."

I am such a hardcore Taylor Jenkins Reid fan.
 I gave The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo 5 stars, and Daisy Jones & The Six 4.5 stars. Unfortunately, though I still thoroughly enjoyed every page, Malibu Rising is my least favorite of the three...and is receiving a 4 star rating. This novel takes place over a twenty-four hour period in 1983, though the first half the book does flash back to the fifties/sixties and encompasses the love story of the Riva patriarch and matriarch, Mick and June. I actually preferred the first half...as that's where we learned about the tragedy-stricken and fully fleshed out Riva family. Mick and June were fascinating, as were their children: Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit. So many secrets...so much heartache. The Malibu setting was a character in its own right. The second half of the book focused entirely on the annual Riva party...and that's where things became a little chaotic. From one half of the book to the other, it genuinely felt like entirely different stories. The party scenes, though interesting, were all over the place. There were so many characters and so much happening, it just felt...messy. Every time a secondary character was introduced, we'd get their entire backstory. For me, it simply didn't work. It was overwhelming, and, honestly, didn't add anything to the plot. I was also disappointed that Malibu rising, set in 1983, didn't really encompass the eighties at all. Unlike the two books I mentioned earlier, which absolutely reveled in the sixties and seventies, respectively, had the pages not told me this story took place in the eighties, I would have assumed it was contemporary and not historical. The prologue is all about Malibu rising from the ashes of multiple fires...it's a huge lead-up for what I assumed would be an amazing conclusion. It wasn't. It was anti-climatic. Nevertheless, Malibu Rising kept me entertained, and if you enjoyed Evelyn and Daisy, I have no doubt you'll also enjoy this one. Available June 1, 2021My heartfelt thanks NetGalley and Random House Publishing - Ballantine for my review copy."

2332,5.0,"WOW ok. taylor jenkins reid’s characterization skills never fail to impress me. it’s always refreshing to indulge in a story with characters that i can connect with, because i feel like i know them. i loved the references to the seven husbands of evelyn hugo and daisy jones & the six!! additionally, the format is so unique, and i enjoyed how the story went from backstories to the present day. what i loved most of all was the extended metaphor comparing fire to a baptism; it was subtle and masterfully executed by the end of the story and perfectly encapsulated the central themes (at least in my perception) of new beginnings, hope, and breaking the cycle laid by your past. i strongly recommend this amazing book <3"

2334,4.0,"Review also published on blog: https://books-are-a-girls-best-friend...Malibu Rising: My First Read by Taylor Jenkins Reid - and What a Read it Was! Family, as we all know, tends to have both good and bad apples. The Riva family is a prime example. Siblings Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit have only ever had each other to rely on. Their love for each other, their mother June, and the ocean, is their bond. Nina became famous at the age of 17 as a surfing model. Nina, however, has other hopes and dreams, ones that seem unattainable. Jay is also famous. An award-winning surfer who has always wanted to make it to the top. Hud is a photographer who makes a living taking photographs. His most celebrated, are of his brother. Kit is the baby of the family. Always in the shadows, she has never been taken seriously. For years, Nina Riva has thrown a party at her home in Malibu - it’s an annual end-of-the-summer party to celebrate and let go. Anyone who's anyone shows up. If you know the address, you’re invited. In the Summer of 1983, Nina Riva hosts her annual Summer Soiree. As the hours count down, the lives of Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit are changed forever. Sheer insanity ensues and I mean insanity. Complete and utter destruction, debauchery, drugs, sex, and of course, rock and roll, transpires. It was like armageddon! All I can say is, I hope this was and is fiction. The loving relationship shared by the siblings made this novel for me! I adored Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit and so appreciated how much they supported each other throughout the course of their lives, regardless of what each person went through. While I didn’t love all aspects of this book and don’t condone the behavior of any of the party-goers, I love the character development and adored the characters of Hud and Kit. This was a buddy read with Kaceey and I really enjoyed sharing this read with her.A huge thank you goes out to Mimi Chan at Goodreads for sending me this galley. Thank you also to Random House Publishing - Ballantine Books and Taylor Jenkins Reid as well.3.5 StarsPublished on Goodreads, Twitter, and Insta."
2336,3.0,"Blahhhhhhh. What a let down after Daisy . Granted that’s the only other Taylor Jenkins Reid book I’ve read other than this, but I’m pretty sure I had it as my top read of 2019? Either way, I just find it hard to grasp how they were written by the same author.Okay that was kind of harsh—it’s not terrible. Reid is a good writer and she captures time periods and locations really well. And previously I would have said she crafts interesting and compelling characters, but I just didn’t see her flexing those writing muscles in the same way here. Malibu Rising follows the children of famous rockstar Mick Riva and his first wife June, as they navigate their lives now that they’re all adults. The story flips back and forth between Mick and June in the past, starting with their courtship up through the eventual decline of their marriage, and the four kids anticipating a huge party that the family throws every year. Normally I love a good duel timeline, but for some reason it didn’t work for me here. I felt detached reading about the ups and downs of June and Mick, like I was watching it on a fuzzy television screen. And maybe it’s just that I’ve read a number of books lately with cheating husbands or family members hooking up with each other’s exes, but those 1983 Riva kid ‘conflicts’ felt so banal in comparison to the torment that their mother went through in the 60s & 70s. So much of the interesting parts ended up as exposition or rushed through, and instead we got a retreading of the same stale drama over and over again.And this party just stressed me the fuck out. It was both chaotic and underwhelming, which I will say is hard to pull off. There were too many tidbits about inconsequential characters and ended up reading like the author’s take on a Project X style house party. I did not enjoy anything throughout it except for, my sole shining beacon of perfect characterization, Tarine Montefiore. Seriously, Taylor, stop telling me things about random pseudo-celebrities you’ve created and give me a hundred pages about Tarine. I have never been so obsessed with a character we saw so little of. The only drawback to this Spanish-Israeli goddess is that she is introduced so late in the story!I guess I haven’t talked much about the Riva siblings, but that’s probably because they are boring. Nina is the most interesting, but she also had the most character development and really was the one who got the rawest deal of the group. Her finally cracking was a cathartic triumph for oldest daughters everywhere, and maybe the only break in the tension of that party. Kit is the typical sarcastic baby sister of the family, but she is difficult to not like. Hud is supposed to be stoic and lovable, but I didn’t really care one way or another about him, surprisingly. Jay was annoying. He’s the most like his father, so that tracks.Yeah, this is no Daisy Jones & The Six. Maybe this is a sign for TJR to move away from this location and era, as I believe this is the third book of hers set in/around LA in the second half of the 20th century. I’ll probably still end up reading The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo just because people cannot stop telling me to, and after that we’ll see. I know some people loved this, but if you’ve got something else to read I’d say you can probably skip this one.Also there is too much surfing. *Thanks to Random House - Ballantine & Netgalley for an advance copy!**For more book talk & reviews, follow me on Instagram at @elle_mentbooks!"

2338,5.0,"***Now Available***Can anyone say BEACH READ? Malibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid will be released on June 1, 2021, just in time for long summer days at the beach. Pour yourself a Sea Breeze cocktail and relax into this story about the Riva family. You’ll be glad you indulged yourself.The prologue of the novel talks about the many times Malibu has caught on fire and then risen from the ashes. This is a very appropriate metaphor for the Riva family, who live in Malibu, and who have survived some major crises.Taylor Jenkins Reid fans first met “Gullible Mick Riva” when Evelyn Hugo used him to cover up a lesbian affair and made him one of her husbands. He left her the day after the wedding and the marriage was annulled. The next time we saw Mick was at a wild party hosted by Daisy Jones in the novel Daisy Jones & The Six. In Malibu Rising, we learn what a total jerk Mick Riva really is. You don't need to have read the other novels before this one since Mick is a very minor character in the first two.Prior to being one of The 7 husbands of Evelyn Hugo, Mick Riva married a sweet, beautiful girl from Malibu named June. They had two children, Nina and Jay. Mick was a very popular rock star, who traveled the world. June stayed in Malibu with the children. When Jay was a few months old, a starlet appeared at the door and handed June her child, Hudson. She explained Hudson was Mick’s son and she didn’t want to care for him. Even though this was the first time June learned that her husband was having an affair, June raised Hudson as her own. But of course, Mick left her high and dry. After a series of romances and marriages, he came back to June a changed man. They remarried and had a daughter named Kit. Then soon thereafter, Mick left for good. Even though he was rich, he never gave the family a dime, never called, nothing. Even when tragedy strikes, he ignores his family.The four Riva children ended up raising themselves because June was an alcoholic who always believed Mick would come back. Nina, as the oldest, bore the responsibility of caring for her younger siblings. When Nina was able to make money as a swimsuit model, the four kids decided to throw a party. And this party became more and more famous, year after year.The book follows the day of the party in August 1983, hour by hour. There are flashbacks to Mick and June’s relationship, the kids’ childhood, hardships, relationships, and successes. At the party, it is sometimes difficult to keep up with the numerous guests. The party is by far the wildest ever, with several surprise guests. And by the time the party is over, Malibu is burning again.I am torn between 4 and 5 stars on this book. Is it as good as Daisy Jones? No. Is it great literature? No. But it is entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking. And, as I said earlier: it is the perfect beach read. So, I am going to round my 4.5 up to 5-stars.Thanks to #NetGalley and #Ballentine Books for my advanced reader copy. Be sure to put this on your to-be-read list."
2339,3.0,"”There was finally enough air within her for a fire to ignite”.Esperaba amar este libro igual que amé Los Siete Maridos de Evelyn Hugo, pero eso no sucedió. En Malibú Renace nos encontramos con la historia de vida de los hermanos Riva (Nina, Jay, Hud y Kit) y todo por lo que han tenido que pasar desde que eran pequeños gracias a las idas y venidas de Mick, su padre rockstar, y el eventual alcoholismo de Jude, su madre. El libro va jugando entre el pasado de estos chicos y su vida actual, en la que se están preparando para dar la famosísima fiesta anual de los Riva con todas las celebridades más candentes de Hollywood. Pero, como dice la sinopsis, la fiesta de ese año no sólo será la que más se salga de control, sino una en la que muchísimas verdades y secretos saldrán a la luz y amenazarán con destruirlo todo una vez más. Creo que Malibú Renace es un libro que deja un gran mensaje con respecto a los lazos familiares, el abandono y las responsabilidades de padres que ningún hijo debería asumir por la negligencia de sus progenitores. Además, Taylor Jenkins Reid crea un lazo impresionante entre los hermanos Riva, quienes tuvieron que crecer y madurar a la fuerza para valerse por sí mismos dada la falta de figuras paternas y maternas competentes en sus vidas. Creo que esta historia refleja de una manera cruda los sacrificios que un hermano puede hacer por otro con tal de verlos felices, estudiando, con un techo sobre sus cabezas y con comida en el plato. Ahora, a pesar de que evidentemente sentía empatía por los sacrificios de Nina, el gran secreto que guardaba Hud, el miedo que sentía Jay por su futuro y la angustia de descubrirse a sí misma de Kit, en el fondo no me conecté lo suficiente con la historia de ninguno de ellos como para que el libro me enganchara y no pudiera dejar de leerlo. Como les digo, Malibú Renace me pareció medianamente entretenido, pero no me fascinó. De hecho, creo que esperaba que todo se centrara más en la fiesta y en el gran incendio que nos prometían… y, la vedad, precisamente esa parte me decepcionó. Mi pequeña teoría es que este libro, al tener tantísimos personajes, líneas de historia y momentos en el tiempo, no pudo ahondar lo suficiente en cada uno de quienes realmente importaban en la trama. Y, no sé, quizás es por eso por lo que siento que, si bien conocí la punta del iceberg de muchísimos personajes, quedaron perdidas por debajo del océano la mayor parte de sus personalidades, motivaciones, problemas e historias. Sí, creo que es eso, Malibú Renace me dejó con una sensación de que todo estaba incompleto. Una pena. "

(all spoilers are under spoiler tags)my reading experience was slightly hampered because i was busy with a lot of life shit while i was reading, otherwise i would have swiftly devoured this novel. but i'm honestly amazed by how much was able to love a predictable book about a whole lot of rich white people.TJR's writing is masterful! i was continually amazed by how wonderful she is with words, at conjuring beautiful coastal imagery, and at humanizing all of the characters. even the detestable characters. even the side characters who are just there to offer some flavor and realism. and especially the main characters: the amazing riva family. they all come to life, and they all feel real and understandable at the core.the party itself, gradually going wilder until it spins out of control, is fun. the tension builds steadily as so many separate melodramas unfold on top of each other. but lifestyles of the rich and the famous are usually unappealing to me, and i can also understand how various side characters' backstories might be interpreted as filler. the family story is the heart of the book. i adored:‣ june. her desperation for something larger than what she's been given. her luminous love for her children, pure and endless, even when circumstances are at their worst. her neverending status as a ""tenderhearted dreamer,"" and the depth of her desire to be loved, (view spoiler)[so deep that she takes mick riva back even after he breaks her heart; so deep that drinking is the only way she knows to ease the pain. june's death is absolutely heartbreaking. i immediately thought of dolores o'riordan, who also drowned in her bathtub, alone with a drink. so horribly lonely. (hide spoiler)]‣ radiant, devoted nina. (view spoiler)[her resilience, and her determination to parent her siblings when she's still a kid herself. i adore her arc of realizing she is free to do things for herself, rather than to give endlessly to others. (hide spoiler)]‣ kit, and her quiet, determined bravery. and... (view spoiler)[i am always happy to see unexpected lgbt+ representation in lit (and especially in a book that is otherwise so overwhelming heterosexual), but i was a bit confused by kit's identity struggle. she clearly has no interest in kissing men (despite her best efforts), but until she comes out to herself, there's no indication that she's interested in women, either! i was truly hoping that this would be an amazing case of ace representation, because she gives of such ace vibes!! what she says about desiring softness does make sense, but i don't think the book shows this well enough. i still love gay kit, and i'm very pleased that the book does have an lgbt+ element, but it would make more sense if she was ace. maybe the world isn't ready for that type of representation in mainstream lit though. (hide spoiler)]‣ the idea of found family becoming real family. (view spoiler)[hud is never less of a riva than his siblings, though he's technically their half brother. no one ever questions him. and i absolutely loved seeing it come full circle with casey, their new possible-half-sibling whom hud is determined to love, just as june was determined to love hud when he was vulnerable and alone.  (hide spoiler)]‣ the theme of intergenerational trauma and unwanted family traditions. (view spoiler)[so many intense parallels: june running the seafood restaurant despite her determination to do more with her life, and nina eventually running it as well. mick's neglectful parents, and all the pain mick inflicts on his own children. mick betraying june for another woman, and hud betraying jay for a woman, and hud's absolute horror at the thought of being like his father. the characters are, for the most part, painfully aware of these connections. i love nina's idea of our parents' legacies as boxes of all the things they carried. we get to decide what to keep and what to leave behind. it's absolutely beautiful that june's deep love for her children lives on through them and their capacities to love. (hide spoiler)]‣ the family's reckoning with mick. (view spoiler)[it's so painfully believable for him to waltz into the party after years of estrangement, hoping to be welcomed back with open arms. i'm grateful that he and his children are able to sit on the beach and talk shit out. so painful to be disappointed by your father over and over again, even when your expectations are at rock bottom. so painful to accept that your father will never be who you need(ed) him to be. (hide spoiler)]
Nina was in it with all of her heart now, as only those who have been hurt and learned to trust again truly can be. It is as if once your heart has been broken you learn of the deepest reserves it carries.
my one criticism is that the story doesn't feel as firmly rooted in 1983 as i'd expect from historical fiction. we have some celebrity name dropping, references to 80s fashion, and a lot of cocaine, but otherwise the 80s hollywood vibes aren't strong enough.anyway, i loved this book. i think the 24 hour format, from 7am the morning before the party to 7am as the party is winding down, is ideal for keeping up the pace. i also loved the flashbacks interspersed throughout the first half of the book. it was truly a joy to read!!"

Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world....
The Riva clan seems to be doing just that. Nina Riva, the eldest, who has played Fiona Gallagher (a la Shameless) to her siblings has a modeling and surfing career that even her husband's recent infidelity can't shake. Brothers Hud and Jay both surf and so does younger sister Kit. This all crescendoes in the party of the year, hosted yearly by Nina, but this year circumstances are a bit different. As we are whisked into the tumultuous past of alcoholic mom June and crooner and scoundrel extraordinaire dad Mick, we begin to unravel the tapestry barely binding this family together, how they got here, and the heartbreak and tension still lingering from the traumas of long ago. With a ticking clock pounding in the background throughout the novel, this party might soon be one the Rivas never would have expected, when a few surprise guests threaten to destroy everything the siblings have worked for so far. Will they be able to band together one final time before fate tears them apart...for good?TJR never fails to impress when it comes to the worlds she creates, and there's always atmosphere a-plenty in her books. Her characters, however, are always a wild card in her novels. So many I find fascinating, lovable, and unique...but this book didn't leave me with the same ‘I feel like I actually KNOW them' feeling I had while reading Maybe in Another Life or The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo for example. There's also the small problem that the character the novel is essentially centered around is completely unlikable. I was hoping this would lead to a redemption moment at the end of the story, or at the very least, would leave me with conflicting feelings, but I was disappointed to not feel those emotions here. This book didn't need to feel like a bildungsroman, but I am a bit lost as to what end TJR was actually going for here in terms of character development. I'm not sure what would have helped me to reach those conclusions, but I felt a lot of the action was less intense than expected and more in line with a calmer domestic drama. Despite these hiccups, Malibu Rising is a quick and engaging read, doused with California sunshine, a bit too much 'white powder' (but then, it was the 80s), and solid family dynamics explored with ease by Taylor Jenkins Reid. Although I didn't connect with this story as much as some of her previous work, I thoroughly look forward to whichever scene, decade, and cast of characters TJR gives us next! 3.5 ⭐️, rounded up"
2343,4.0,"The Riva family is Malibu royalty. They weren’t always a famous family and fame is not all it’s cracked up to be.Their mom was born to restaurant owners and their dad became a famous singer. Dad steps out on mom repeatedly. Mom dies. Kids left to raise themselves under their big sisters leadership. But that’s not what this book is about nor is it where the story ends.The Riva siblings blossom into independent adults. They still surf together, meet at the restaurant for Ninas special sandwich, and help each other as sibling should. They had it rough, but they made it out alive. Every year they host the famous ‘Riva party’ - you never know who will be there and what will happen. All the locals want to attend, but there’s no invite. If you know where Nana lives you’re invited! And this years party may be the best one yet!! 🎊 I truly enjoy Taylor Jenkins Reid’s writing style. The reader becomes part of the book. You learn to know and love the characters and it makes you a little sad when the book ends. So what’s a reader to do but pick up another TJR novel!"

2345,5.0,"While I was reading my Read With Jenna June book club pick, “Malibu Rising” by Taylor Jenkins Reid, I was reminded of a New York Times article by Frank Bruni, “The Gift of Siblings.” At its core, this novel is about the powerful bond shared by sisters and brothers who, as Bruni reminds us, are the only people who will know us deeply for the entirety of our lives. With her powerful writing, Reid explores how hard it is to break the sibling bond, even when everything is heading towards a fracture. “Malibu Rising” tells the story of one summer night that changes everything for the four Riva siblings, Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit, who are the offspring of legendary singer Mick Riva. Over the course of a 24-hour period, Reid skillfully mixes Nina’s legendary end-of-summer party with flashbacks to Mick’s tumultuous relationship with his children’s mother. I loved the contrast between 1950s and 1980s Malibu and the insight into what makes these characters who they are.  Reid’s quintessential beach read, is compulsively fun and impossible to put down. After a trying year, summer could not come fast enough. Let this book transport you to the cliffside homes and wide, sandy beaches of Malibu this June."
2346,5.0,"no sé si darle 4.75 o 5.honestamente, no le tenía nada de fe a malibú renace jajajaja. la sinopsis no me llamaba la atención, no había escuchado a gente hablar mucho del libro, y pensaba que me iba a aburrir un montón. me alegra demasiado haber estado equivocada. no sé muy bien qué me pasó con este libro, pero conecté a un nivel muy profundo con cada uno de los personajes. logré sentir sus ambiciones, sus pérdidas, sus frustraciones y AAAA. me encantó leerlos y acompañarlos en estas páginas.malibú renace es de esos libros que te hace sentir de todo. yo lloré, me enojé, me alegré y me estresé leyendo este libro... y lo amé. los libros que más valen la pena son aquellos que te hacen sentirlo todo.tuve dos pequeños problemas con el libro. el primero, es que en un momento introducen a muchos personajes no muy significativos y, si bien me interesó leerlos, luego no recordaba quien era quien jajaja. mi segundo ""problema"" es que el final no fue tan épico como estaba esperando. sí siento que fue un final que cerró perfectamente un ciclo, pero sentí que me faltó algo. sin embargo, es un libro que recomendaré mucho.amé malibú renace y quiero seguir leyendo a TJR.

2347,5.0,"4.5 stars!I think we all love Taylor Jenkins Reid here, right? ❤ I could not wait to pick this one up. Set in Malibu during the early 1980s, I was fascinated with the dynamics of this surfer/rocker family. It takes place over the course of one day, while also flashing back to the parents’ early relationship years prior. We also hear from each of the four siblings in the countdown to the party and after.This is the party of the year, too. Everyone who is anyone comes to Nina’s party. What happens that night may leave its mark on Malibu and this family forever.I could read TJR’s stories all day, every day. Even though One True Loves will probably always be my favorite, and Eleanor and Daisy are second and third, I think (today!?), I enjoyed my time spent getting to know this family and the anticipation leading up to the party. Drama and scandals, secrets, lies, drugs, and rock and roll; everything you would expect from this time and place is here. If you are looking for pure entertainment this summer, Malibu Rising is absolutely it!Thank you, Mimi at Goodreads and Random House, for the gifted copy.

2348,4.0,"4.25 ⭐️As always, written so so well, each bit of information given all feels necessary Nina is the glue of the family, and also the glue of this entire book. Every part I read about her, I loved. I love her courage, her selflessness, I love her dedication to her family. My heart ACHED for her. And as much as I love all of the siblings, my love for Nina tops them all.This covers the POV of a lot of people, mainly the Riva family, siblings and parents, but also the people that they came into contact with, just fleeting POVs nothing continuous. It's told in third person and the POV bounces around a lot, but it's not something that's so difficult to follow.Their love for each other as siblings is MAGNIFICENTLY PORTRAYED. I loved it so much. That was the anchor to the story for me as much as Nina was.Mick, as much as I understood where he was coming from and what made him who he was and how he got to where he was, I cannot get behind this guy. I didn’t like him from EH and it stands to be true now.Mick is first seen in EH, and this is set almost in that same world where it follows his and his family’s lives. There are small mentions of other characters we loved in EH, but subtly and not so subtly. Celia is mentioned once, and Evelyn is also mentioned without outrightly being named.Overall, I still enjoyed the book. I found myself glossing over some parts, but the true anchors of the book still stuck out to me. Is it my favorite from her? No, EH still takes the cake.I definitely thought there was going to be something grander coming into this book. The prologue certainly hinted at it, and while the book still follows that endgame, it didn’t happen the way I expected it to happen. I almost wanted the pain and tears of EH.The story is told through the 7am on a Saturday to 7am the following day. I loved the layout of the chapters. I love the way it was broken down and how there were snippets of the past and getting to learn how their parents’ life affected the siblings.Overall, still a great read!"
2349,4.0,"Twitter | Goodreads | Blog | Instagram  | For me, I didn’t enjoy Daisy Jones & the six.I’m unpopular with my opinion I know.But this book took me by surprise. What I thought it was going to be (like a Jackie Collins novel) with horrid little rich people sniping at each other and Botox lol….turned out to be nothing of the sort.This had a lot of depth to it.Grief.Loss of a parent in death and a father who couldn’t handle fatherhood. Yes, they had money, but they worked for it.The eldest daughter made sacrifices.The family dynamics were intense and I loved every word and shocked myself that I enjoyed it so much.I only read it thinking I needed an escape from thrillers, maybe a nice summer read. What I got was much more. So maybe I’ll give her yet another chance when she brings her next book out!"
2350,4.0,"Malibu Rising is the book of summer and while Daisy and Evelyn will continue to hold my #1 and #2 spots in TJR’s lineup of captivating stories, I really liked this great one too!Nina Riva and her siblings, Jay, Hud, and Kit, throw an epic summer party which has become an annual tradition in Malibu, growing in size and notoriety each year. It’s 1983 and the story follows the family over the course of 24 hours as they prepare for then host the party, and each reflect internally. The Riva siblings have been through a lot together growing up, and the story includes flashbacks to the past, showing challenges they’ve faced with their parents’ unsteady relationship, their financial woes, and decisions about their futures, then and now. It’s so easy to get swept up into TJR’s stories, feeling invested in the characters. I really enjoyed Malibu Rising which was a perfect summer read."
2351,4.0,"It’s August 1983, location is Cliffside Drive and the home of Nina Riva. This is the story of the twenty four hours up to and after the annual party thrown by Nina, attended by her siblings Jay, Hud and Kit and anyone who is anyone in this neck of the woods. They are the offspring of singer and serial philanderer Mick Riva has has been conspicuous by his absence for most of their lives leaving their mother June to raise them until her death when Nina is nearly eighteen. By midnight the party is definitely humming and getting lively, by 2am they’re swinging from the chandeliers and by early morning the house is on fire but out of the destructive ashes there is renewal. The story is told in multiple timelines from 1968 to 1983, charting their childhood but mostly focusing on THAT day and night. This is a very well written and immersive read from an author who is a really good storyteller. It’s extremely easy to read with the plot building and rising to a crescendo like Malibu waves. The characterisation is very strong especially of the Rivas but in particular Nina who is the essential lynchpin and the glue of the family. You cannot help but admire the personal sacrifices and the toll it takes on her keeping the family together after their mother’s death. During the course of the dramatic events of the party night Nina finally comes to life, is able to cast off the cloak of her responsibilities and be reborn. The family dynamics are fascinating and enjoyable, they’re very close and a unit but like many other siblings they have some fallouts. The impact of Mick’s absence on them all is huge but they’ve learned to live without him, he’s like a ghost to them. I really like how the surf of Malibu and the Californian coast becomes their obsession, their Malibu Rising is the soaring waves. Malibu helps Nina rise above the doldrums of the loss of their much loved mother, the way her life became as a consequence and is able to live the life she actually wants. I like the message of the book, the fire, the renewal and rising from the ashes to be the selves they want to be. The party is totally over the top, there are so many undercurrents and it feels like a crazy Bacchanalian orgy which rises and rises until it’s an out of control tsunami. To an extent I think the terrible events of the party overshadows the essential point of the book, it detracts from it and part of this is caused by there being so many characters present it gets a bit bewildering. It gets a bit scattergun towards the end too, not flowing as well as the previous three quarters or so. However, I do overall enjoy the book and this is an author I’ll always want to read. With thanks to NetGalley and especially to Random House UK, Cornerstone, Hutchinson for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review."
2352,3.0,"3.25 surfing starsAs the title would suggest, this one is set in Malibu and focuses on the iconic Riva family. The four siblings run the local beach-side restaurant; one is a world class surfer, one a calendar model, one a talented photographer, and the youngest an aspiring surfer. Their father, famous singer Mick Riva, has been out of their lives for decades.The first half of the book really sets the stage with the backstory for all the characters and the second half is focused on the annual Riva beach party. Nina is the hostess and her famous tennis husband recently left her. The party is filled with famous guests, alcohol, drugs, and things get out of hand. There are surprise guests, new romantic liaisons while others fall apart. I’m normally a big fan of Taylor Jenkins Reid, so it’s hard to write this review. I’ve really enjoyed “Daisy Jones and the Six” and “Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo” but this one just didn’t have the magic to draw me in. I didn’t connect with the characters as much as I did with her other books. I know plenty of other readers have loved this one, but it just fell a little flat for me. Thank you to NetGalley and Random House/Ballantine for the early copy to read. This one will be out for beach reading 5.25.2021."
2353,4.0,"Malibu Rising thankfully lived up to my alarmingly high expectations. This book follows the Riva siblings, the kids of the notorious singer, Mick Riva. I was a bit hesitant upon hearing this, because I hated Mick in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. And I hated him even more from his short appearance in Daisy Jones & the Six. But this book has made me realize that hatred has no bounds. Mick Riva is actually scum of the earth. I really liked the Malibu setting of this story, and this was undoubtedly a very well written book. In the present, Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit Riva, who are Mick and June Riva's children, prepare for Nina's famously coveted party that she throws every year. We follow them through their drama filled lives and their individual struggles. There are also flashbacks intertwined that introduce June, and her relationship with Mick. We read about all she and her children had to go through as a consequence of Mick's disregard, and my heart honestly was breaking for them all throughout. I will admit that I did tear up a few times, I simply couldn't help it. I'm just another emotionally unstable reader that cries over everything.This book is definitely a page turner. The characters and their struggles all felt so real, which is something I love about TJR's books. I am always immersed by her stories. I 100% recommend Malibu Rising. And to clarify, you don't need to read Evelyn Hugo or Daisy Jones beforehand, though it certainly wouldn't hurt if you did. My only critique is that there was wayyyyy too many side characters once the party started, and I couldn't care less about them. I felt like the story sidetracked with all the different perspectives, which I didn't like. Also the ending was a bit rushed. I don't know, I wish there was more to it. But otherwise, this is a great book.BR with human! <3"
2354,5.0,2:45 am and here i am crying because once again tjr wrote a beautiful book that transported me back in time. i absolutely loved this book and could not put it down from the moment i picked it up. it had me feeling every emotion. i would literally give nina the entire world because she deserves it. added a few days later:the family dynamic of this story truly made it better. each sibling had something they were going through and seeing it through the parallel time lines made it really interesting to read. each character was unique and made the story that much better. I think the choice to follow mick riva was genius. from her other novels we know his reputation and getting to see his backstory elevated this novel. I genuinely enjoyed this book so much and can’t wait to reread.

“How were you supposed to change- in ways both big and small- when your family was always there to remind you of exactly the person you apparently signed an ironclad contract to be?”

This is my fourth novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid (5th book if we’re counting Evidence of the affair which is a novella) and I don’t think I gave any of them less than 4 stars. By this point, She is one of my auto-read authors and I am always excited for whatever she comes up with next. Up to this point my favorite book of her is Evelyn Hugo and Malibu Rising is now in the second place!I have been hunting for a good family drama novel for a while now. The latest ones I read like Ask Again yes didn’t satisfy the itch! I just love those stories because I like complex families and the dynamics found within those, that’s why I was such a big fan of “Watching Glass Shattered” and “Little Fires Everywhere” and speaking of the latter, this book starts in a very similar way where we know that Malibu’s destiny is to be burned and that that happened in the past many times. 

“What broken family—no matter how shattered be reunited? What child, no matter how lost or abandoned, does not ache to be loved?”

The book follows The Riva family, specifically the kids of the singer Mick Riva. They are not kids now because all of them are older than 20 and are starting their own lives. Every year they host a party at Nina’s house and this part ends in a fire as the prologue tells us, so the book explores all the events leading to this fire.The book is divided into two parts: from 7 am to 7 pm and then 7 pm to 7 am. Every chapter takes place in an hour but there are also chapters intertwined in the first part following the story of Nina’s parents. The format sounds weird but it is very well written, easy to follow and interesting. The writing is great because it is not purple but at the same time is is very gripping, it is the “just one more chapter” kind of story.As in every TJR novel, the thing that makes the story shine is the characters. They start as strange characters but by the end the reader can’t help but care about them and root for them. I am not gonna delve into a separate discussion of each of them but Nina probably was my favorite because you can see her grow through the story and stand for herself for once. The funny thing is that there is a plethora of characters and the author gives us a glimpse into all of them and they’re all coming to the party for all kind of reasons from the silliest most simplistic ones to the darkest and deepest ones. I think TJR has an unparalleled ability to connect the reader to the secondary characters sometimes in just a paragraph!!

“Nina understood, maybe for the first time, that letting people love you and care for you is part of how you love and care for them.”

The plot is complex because it is a complex family. This is the good type of complexity though because it was interesting and easy to read. I think there were many topics covered but I didn’t think the author overdid it. I like to believe that real life is as complex as painted in this novel which explains my love for such a kind of novels. As I said, the reader gets the ending from the prologue but it doesn’t make it any less intriguing because the reader keeps guessing what’s coming next and what will lead to that ending. Also it is fast paced which is always a plus for me.Summary: Once again, TJR proves herself with another book that will be a hit for sure. I loved almost everything about it, from the format used to chapter lengths and pacing and most importantly, the writing and characters. I am giving it 4 1/4 out of 5 stars (or 8.5/10) because some parts were points of focus in the story and yet their resolve felt a bit underwhelming. Overall, very happy with it and looking for Reid’s next book already!"
2357,5.0,"June Costas was 17-years old when she met Mick Reva and in no time he had captivated her heart, mind and soul. They married with their first child, Nina, already on the way. Mick was wickedly handsome, extremely talented and soon reached success as a singer, performing in famous venues far away from their home in Malibu. He was charming and attracted people effortlessly, including beautiful women who he never seemed to be able to resist. June had abandoned her own dreams for this man who kept abandoning her until four children later, after each time he wormed his way back in until finally he never returned. See, to understand those four children (Nina, Jay, Hud & Kit), it’s essential to know their history because both parents left an imprint that defined them as adults and drew them to that Malibu surf. Fast forward twenty years later and it’s the annual Reva family party that is infamous in Malibu. But in the years since they first began hosting the event, it’s become well known beyond Malibu because of the high profile success of Nina, Jay and Hud but especially because of those they’re connected to. It’s in the background for the siblings as they each are focused on their personal life crises. Nina is married to a top ranked tennis player who just walked out on her for another woman; Jay has a medical condition that threatens his livelihood; Hud is in a secret relationship that may disrupt the family; and Kit is grappling with her own self awareness. I was fascinated with them all as that party loomed ominously.I’d read reviews of this story that were critical, focusing on the debauchery of the party. I firmly believe that the audiobook version made it clearer that the party was a secondary element despite its outrageousness. Julia Whelan always delivers a wonderful performance but here she showed some serious skill in not only distinguishing each of the siblings but telling the story in such a way that the distance between the craziness of the party and the people that showed up from the Reva siblings lives was so blatant. I was not distracted by any of it, craving the parts that brought me closer to the climactic moment where the family finally gets to make choices for themselves and not borne out of their family history. It was compelling and Whelan leads you there, building anticipation for that moment that still surpassed my expectations. There are so many layers to this story and I connected with it strongly. I’ve known people like Nina who were forced to step into adult roles and take care of their siblings when the parents vacated those responsibilities. Of all of them, I rooted for her the most as she’d always made life choices for the sake of her family, selflessly and often humiliating, but not only keeping them together but leading them to success. If you can rise above the metaphorically distracting party, you’ll understand the beauty of Malibu Rising and get the cleverness of that title. Taylor Jenkins Reid remains at the top of my list of auto listen authors. 4.5 starsPosted on Blue Mood Café(Thanks to the publisher and Libro.fm for my complimentary copy. All opinions are my own.)"
2358,5.0,"Review published in: https://diagnosisbookaholic.blogspot....4,5 ⭐A couple of years back I absolutely adored ""The seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo"". Then ""Daisy Jones & The Six"" was a huge disappointment. I don't know if it was the book's format or the fact that I listened to the audiobook version, but I didn't connect with it at all. Not having read any other books by Taylor Jenkins Reid, I came into this one with trepidation as I didn't want to be disappointed again. And I wasn't! Although not in the same league as Evelyn Hugo, I enjoyed it much more than Daisy Jones.Malibu, 1983. It's the night of Nina Riva's annual party at her Malibu house. Throughout the day we get to know all the Riva siblings: Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit. As they get ready for the party we learn about their lives, their secrets and their bond with each other. This is basically a story about the bond between siblings and how sticking together will make you stronger when facing adversities.Through a series of flashbacks we learn about Mick Riva, the strange father of the Riva kids (and one of Evelyn Hugo's husbands!), how he met their mother and the impact his leaving when they were little kids had in all of them.I loved the past timeline and maybe it was the location, maybe it was the time the story was set in, but it gave me some serious Jackie Collins vibes.I don't usually like stories taking place in a very short period of time, as they tend to drag along and become a bit repetitive, but in this case it worked perfectly having the present line taking place in just 24 hours. The fact that it had a huge cast of characters and that we learn some of their backstories too, made no time for boredom.After reading the synopsis I thought I would hate the Riva siblings as I thought they would be your typical entitled rich kids, but guess what? I loved them! I really connected with all of them, although I had a soft spot for Nina. I really loved her transformation throughout the story. The only but I found was that sometimes they read as older than their actual age, but seeing that in 1983 I was just months old, what do I know how people behaved then?The writing was excellent, the characters very well developed and the plot entertaining and a bit emotional. All in all, a perfect way to kick off the year with a book I'm sure will appeal to lots of readers."
2359,4.0,"Surf's up!  Set in the Malibu coastal area, this is apt to be the very beachiest book out there right now.  It's easy to imagine the smell of sea salt in your hair and in the air, and to feel the warmth and scratch of sand between your toes.  The Riva family's end-of-summer party is happening.  Teeming with the rich and famous, many of whom are behaving very badly.  I thought I had been to some wild parties in the 80's, but never anything to rival this.  (view spoiler)[In the Ozarks, we tend not to arbitrarily trash the host's house, or purposely destroy or steal his belongings while partying. Just sayin'. (hide spoiler)]  Although this is not my favorite book by this author, I am in for the proverbial long haul with her.  I refuse to call it a guilty pleasure, as I am reading for entertainment here.  She knows how to tell a story and makes it easy to read.  As easy as falling off a surfboard."
2360,4.0,"Malibu Rising is set in one night in Malibu in the 1980's. We meet the Riva family: Nina, Hud, Kit, and Jay. The story has flashbacks to the beginning of the family and some of the heart aches along the way. It also shares the stories of various party goers.This book told many different stories, and some of them were more interesting than others. However, the author had the bravery to go beyond merely telling a happily ever after story but a more realistic one. The pacing on this book was off. The first chapter of the book was such a disservice. I found it to be incredibly boring and didn't intrigue me or pull me in. As I started to read the book, I started to warm up to it and started to really enjoy it although I do think a few of the stories dragged on a bit too long.*Thank you NetGalley for providing me a free copy of this book for my fair and honest opinion."

2362,4.0,"So glad I finally got to read TJR's latest book! The author has a special way of weaving complex characters and complicated situations together. This book is no exception.Split into two parts, this is the story of Mick Riva's family, specifically his kids. Part 1 tells the story of the early days of the Riva family. Part 2 takes place on the evening of the annual Riva party. The year is 1983 and this summer party is unlike all the others. In fact, it becomes a defining moment in the lives of each of the Riva kids.I was immediately immersed in the story, the setting, and the characters' lives. I enjoyed Part 1 much more than Part 2, but overall found the story engaging throughout. This won't be my favorite TJR book, but it's one I'll think of for a long time."
2363,4.0," 4 stars! Malibu Rising follows the Riva siblings, children of the famous singer Mick Riva. From present day leading up to a massive party, to the past and the history of how their parents met and how the siblings grew up over the years. I won’t say much more than that because I don’t want to give anything away. I have to say one thing about TJR, I went out on release day on my lunch break from work to buy this book from Barnes and Noble. She’s the kind of author that once she has a fan, they are loyal for sure. I don’t go out and buy books on release day, so that’s how I know she’s one of my all-time favorites.I wasn’t sure what to expect from this book, there are so many different reviews out there I went into this book a tiny bit wary. But the characters are well developed and excellent, the writing is on point, and I was compelled until the very end when reading this book. I will say, plot wise this book started very strong and then fizzled for me like a candle that’s been abruptly blown out. I didn’t love how every character just seemed to be “the best” at whatever they did. But I definitely enjoyed reading this and can see how much thought Reid put into it. This is very much a thought-provoking novel and one I think is great for discussion. A must for book clubs, I can see all readers having different opinions they will want to share about this book."
2364,4.0,"“Malibu Rising” is a fantastic story of a family of four siblings who manage to maintain closeness after living through a sad, poverty dominated childhood. It’s also a story of Malibu in the 1960’s and 1970’s when surfing ruled and before celebrities totally dominated the town. The story is divided into two time periods. The current, August 27, 1983 which is the day of the epic Riva end of summer party, is told by the hour, beginning at 7am. And then author Taylor Jenkins Reid takes us to 1956, to provide the story of June and Mick Riva’s love story. Mick swept June off her feet, telling her he was going to provide the moon and the sky to her. He was going to make it big as a singer. Mick is a smarmy man who provides nothing but heart break.Mick leaves June for another woman, after June has two children. In fact, another woman leaves one of Mick’s children with June to raise. June is over her head and living on a shoe-string budget. Reading about their lives through the years, all the hardships they faced, while Mick became more famous brings rage to the reader. Mick does return and father’s another child, making the Riva family a family of four children. Of course, he leaves them again.Through the poverty, the kids grow close. June crumbles under the pressure. Nina ends up raising her siblings at the age of 17. The siblings grew close, protecting each other. The siblings also grew functional, able to exceed in their fields. Nina inadvertently becomes a surfing model which provides the necessary funds to raise her siblings. One brother becomes a pro surfer and the other is a pro photographer. And the baby, who is still in high school in 1983 has surfing interests as well. Through their impoverished childhood, they learned to succeed professionally and keep their tight family bonds.So back to the party day. Hour by hour, we get updates of this crazy party. Reid makes this into a suspense novel as the hours grow late into the party. There are a few family secrets that will be revealed and tests the bonds of the siblings. The party ends up being what Hollywood wants us to believe how the rich and famous party. Crazy stuff happens at that party.This is a story about one insane party that becomes a pivotal and defining moment in the Riva sibling’s lives. Plus, from the start we know there is a fire that burns down the party house. The suspense: how did it start and who started it? But more than that, the suspense for me was how is this party going to end??More than that, it’s a story of family and how a harsh childhood created strong sibling bonds."
2365,3.0,"I had conflicting emotions about this one, which results in a mediocre 3-star rating, although there were parts I adored, while other aspects of this novel were clumsy, if we’re being charitable. Taylor Jenkins Reid is a master at quickly describing characters, capturing their essence, and then balancing an ever-growing cast of characters. We know the interior of every character, the exterior, and their most pressing desires. I bet TJR has the best character map ever drawn. She definitely knows how to play to her strengths. I had only read Daisy Jones prior to this, and TJR borrows some thematic material from her previous ventures, giving us insights into the rich, the beautiful, and the famous (or all 3 at once). Although we rarely admit it, it’s fun to read about the rich and beautiful, especially if they come from a poor, broken background, granting the reader an excuse to root for them. Throughout the novel, there is a palpable satisfaction to tracing the roots of the family tree, nearly becoming a member yourself, picking favorites or sides in arguments. The prose flows, although it sometimes uses a touch of melodramatic to heighten the language. OK, now the not-so-good-stuff. The structure was, in my humble opinion, a mess. Ostensibly alternating between present and flashback, the first half of the novel is largely about Mick Revas, philandering father and famous rock star. TJR serves us this rock n’ roll backstory with straight tropes, nothing else. Did y’all know that rock stars like to sleep with different women? And then feel guilty about it and apologize to their families? Shocking stuff. Nothing in the first half of the novel would have been out of place in a bad Hollywood biopic. We also have flashes of the present, introducing us to his children, building up to the annual Revas party. However, these scenes were underdeveloped and I personally felt no pressing desire to see the party unfold. There are sections of this novel that lag, with the characters rarely in motion, and your enjoyment may come down to your affinity for each particular character.The party itself is more entertaining, with TJR intricately weaving characters into moments of closure or comeuppance. Unfortunately, even her decisions in the second half of the novel are a bit baffling. For every intriguing backstory of a Revas sibling, there is a tangent on a side character that is tedious. Even during the emotional climax, handled with tenderness for everyone involved, we get interrupted with a bizarre arrest scene that is tonally jarring. "
2366,4.0,"I enjoyed it, and didn't want to stop the audiobook, but the story didn't wow me. On the other hand the author's writing pulls me in every single time, and the audiobook is really well narrated by Julia Whelan. Definitely a recommendation to all of my audiobook peeps.Update:The Riva family makes for a vibrant and fascinating story. From how it all began with the parents, to the kids, and then the climax: a fateful evening, a party Malibu won’t forget anytime soon.The nice thing about this book is that I didn’t need any tissues. There was no heartbreak. Instead I got a story about a fascinating family. I was captivated by the siblings and their interactions, the family dynamic and the drama. It all made for a compelling read.Although the book won’t make you think or talk nonstop about it. It won’t change lives. But it certainly entertains. The novel is well written, with some really interesting and genuine characters. It has a great backstory. Just the right amount of family drama. And a touch of Hollywood.In the end the Riva siblings carried the book for me. They were solid. Loved each other, and had each other’s back. And I was really happy with how the book ended. additional thoughtsAlthough the book starts and ends with the mention of Malibu burning, but in the end it’s just a cliff note. In 2020 California experienced some of the worst wildfires in the south as well as the north of the state. While I was living in California, I lived through multiple sommers when one wildfire followed another. There was no break. And these fires were terrible in size, human loss, and property damages. One year after another, California was covered in smoke for weeks and weeks. I woke up at night because I could smell the smoke and found ash inside my apartment the next day. It’s true that Californians know how to evacuate, but it doesn’t take away the anxiety that comes with each summer. Some fires start because of nature doing its thing, others because of human stupidity. But every single one brings devastation to the area it burns.___________________________________I received a copy of this book from the publisher for free in exchange for an honest review.

“Family is found...whether it be blood or circumstance or choice, what binds us does not matter. All that matters is that we are bound.”

Taylor Jenkins Reid has managed to write a book I don't think I would normally like and made me love it. I don't usually love books with little to no romance that follows so many different characters story lines as well as two different time periods, but this one worked for me. The family dynamic was so well done and it gave me so many feels. This is a book about the Riva family. Mick, the famous and absent father. June, the mother who has her own issues after being abandoned time and time again by Mick. Nina, the oldest child and parental figure to the other three who is now into modeling and surfing. Jay, the oldest son and a surfer. Hud, only a few months younger than Jay and raised by June even though she's not his biological mother. Kit, the baby of the family. The story takes place in present time (which is the 80's for this book) right before the annual Riva party that will take place at Nina's home in Malibu. It flashes back to the late 50's when June and Mick first meet and goes back and forth in time. This book is a family drama, but also is full of secrets and waiting to see what will happen and when the next shoe will drop. I loved this family. Well, the siblings. They had such an incredible bond. The parents were another story, especially their father. This one was so intriguing and I enjoyed it so much. I do wish the ending would have given us a little more, but overall a great read.

2369,3.0,"3.5 stars. I listened to the audio CD of Malibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid and enjoyed it. However, I enjoyed Daisy Jones & the Six and Evelyn Hugo so much more. Julia Whalen’s performance, as the narrator of Malibu Rising, was brilliant. Malibu Rising was a character driven book with a plot that explored the themes of family, sibling devotion and rivalry, unconditional motherly love and devotion and a father’s abandonment and the unconventional life he chose to lead. It was written in a dual time period, switching back and forth between the 1950’s and the 1980’s. Both time periods took place in Malibu. The plot centered around one particular night in the present time period of the 1980’s. Nina Riva, the eldest of the Riva siblings, was holding her annual end-of-summer bash. During the hours that led up to Nina’s famous annual party, many details about each of the four Riva siblings would be revealed. The storyline of the 1950’s explored how June Costas, a seventeen year old young woman from a middle class background, and Mick Riva, an aspiring young musician, met, fell in love, married, had children and ultimately chose to live two separate lives with opposing priorities and commitments. June always put her children, their happiness and safety first where Mick chose abandonment and an arsenal of mistresses and many unsuccessful marriages. Malibu Rising explored how a strong sense of family could help to overcome tragedy, financial hardships and sibling rivalry. Overall, I enjoyed Malibu Rising. I felt that there were too many unnecessary characters involved and introduced during the hours of the party. The ending was satisfying and the bond the Riva siblings formed with each other provided understanding, love and protection for each of them. I enjoyed the strong sense of family throughout this book even though it could have easily broken at any given time. I recommend this book."
2370,5.0,"No one – and let me reiterate, NO ONE – was more shocked than I was when I was approved for an early copy of this book. In case you’re new here or need a refresher . . . . 

^^^IT ME!!!!!!And nothing proclaimed my wrongreading capabilities like not enjoying The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo or Daisy Jones and the Six. I’ll take the hit of being a turtle sucker for Evelyn Hugo, but the fault for Daisy Jones gets split three-way between me (a) being an idiot who (b) grew up watching Behind the Music and (c) is a Fleetwood Mac superfan. I always knew that Taylor Jenkins Reid would eventually have a story for me because her writing is good and I got through both of the aforementioned selections quickly despite feeling like Evan Hansen the entire time . . . . 

But times have changed!!!!!!

The story here is about the Riva siblings – Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit. Children of rock star Mick, these four have always stuck together in order to survive their atypical upbringing. This is the tale of one epic night, one unforgettable end-of-summer party and allllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll of the family history. I loved every dangblasted second of this book. The timing is right to once again to pay homage to “The One With Rachel’s Trifle” because ensemble cast? GOOD. 1980s?? GOOOD. Malibu??? GOOOOD. Surfing and supermodels???? GOOOOOOD. Family drama??? GOOOOOOOOOD-to-infinity. To me this is a perfect poolside read. Snatch it up when it comes out next week and you too might find yourself singing a never ending loop of . . . .

2371,4.0,"Malibu contains some of the most glamorous people with lifestyles for the rich and famous. This book gave insight to the many that pursue these dreams and succeed. With it also comes costs that are hard to articulate, such as values and ideology. When I began to read about the Riva family, I was captivated by the rags to riches family. What appeared a simple family, rises up a famous singer, Mick Riva. With his wife and 4 children in tow, Mick encounters cultural impacts and sexual promiscuous that tears his family apart. A price paid, but amazingly the 4 children are successful and become closer dealing with the loss of their mother and finding strength through each other. A strong overseer is Nina, the oldest daughter, a talented surfer and a model whom holds the family together by putting her siblings (Jay, Hud, & Kit) first. She is planning the Party of the Year that the famous thrive on each year.  The Summer of 1983 will never be the same for the Riva family. From the very beginning you know that the house party will end up in flames, but its the little fires everywhere ....sounds familiar... that had me disturbed. Talk about a party out of hand-- the build up doesn't do it justice for what you will encounter.I could not wait for this highly anticipated book to come out and have read so much about this author. Taylor Jenkins Reid shows her talent with her awesome writing skills and kept me captivated through the whole book. Thank you NetGalley & Random House Publishing Group-Ballantine for this incredible book in exchange for my honest review."
2372,5.0,"YOu would have to be living under a rock in the book loving world to not be excited about a new novel from Taylor Jenkins Reid in 2021. I hav to admit that I squealed when I was approved on NetGalley by Random House UK for this highly anticipated book. I just couldn’t wait any longer to read it.. and I devoured it in a few short hours.I was completely immersed in the lives of the Riva family from the opening chapters. It is a family drama, with so much drama. From the meeting of June and Mick and their marriage, to the 4 children and their lives and struggles, you cannot help but get lost in it. I am not going to say too much about the story because the less you know the better. What you will love about his story is the characters and their relationships. Nina is the eldest child and such a strong and likeable character. They are growing up in the 70’s and adults in the 80s amongst the beautiful people of Malibu. Things are not always as they seem and they are all keeping things from each other. Family is the most important thing to these siblings and will do anything to protect each other.TJR has absolute nailed it with Malibu Rising once again. The emotions are all there, the setting is perfect.., I just loved it 💜"
2373,5.0,"4.5 starsThis novel takes place over the course of 24 hours leading up to a huge party. It’s 1983, and 25-year-old Nina Riva is known for throwing *the* party of the year on her cliffside house in Malibu that everyone wants to be at. Nina took over raising her younger siblings after their father abandoned them for a second time and their mother lost herself in a bottle and then, by drowning in the bathtub after drinking too much. The relationship between the siblings is rendered incredibly well, and, remarkably, in a mere 24 hours, there is character arc and change between each other and themselves. This is a little bit dark but ultimately a powerful story about what it means to be a family. Thanks to NetGalley for the opportunity to review this novel, which RELEASES JUNE 1, 2021."
2375,5.0,"Reading Vlog: https://youtu.be/jdi1Pwma13wOkay, let’s go ahead and confront the elephant in the room…Is it as good as Evelyn Hugo or Daisy Jones? No. Surely not. But miracles don’t happen every day.It is this close 👌 to impossible to write a better book. This book is fantastic.The character development and family dynamic in this book are top tier. If you love following characters from naivety through childhood trauma and growing and struggling as a person and seeing who they come out as on the other side, then you’ll love this book. Nina deserves rights. All of them. I would fight for her."

2377,4.0,"Growing up in a beach town in the 80s, Malibu Rising definitely made me nostalgic in a good way. TJR's writing brought to memory my teen years with long days spent at the beach, the smell of the salty air, surfers bobbing up and down waiting for the next wave, the feel of sun kissed skin and the sand between my toes.The story is told from present day 1983 and the preparation for Nina Riva's huge end-of-summer party, as well as the backstory starting in the 1950s with the story of Mick and June. This is a book where I definitely had a preference for one timeline over the other with my interest initially being drawn to June and Mick's backstory despite me wanting to throat punch Mick repeatedly while reading. TJR is so good at making me feel for her characters and this one was no different. June's story broke my heart. I loathed Mick. I loved the fierce loyalty that Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit felt for each other. I could feel the burden placed on Nina's shoulders at such a young age. My main issue is that once the party commenced, I felt like there were a lot of random secondary character's stories that served no purpose, and for me actually detracted from the story of the Riva family. I was invested in their story and wanted the focus to be on that which was lost in the party. 3.5 stars rounded up."
2378,3.0,"This isn’t DAISY JONES nor is it EVELYN HUGO. However, it is straightforward women’s commercial fiction and there’s nothing wrong with that. It will hit all of the lists; many readers will love it but I expected more. It’s a family story mainly about close siblings trying to sort out their identities, lives and loves. Their parents’ story is a simplistically written romance with far reaching consequences. I found the prologue to be an engaging introduction to Malibu’s history of burning to be a terrific set up for a rip roaring read. Ultimately, it just didn’t catch fire for me."
2379,3.0,"There were moments in this story which showed promise, but overall this was a disjointed story that felt like it was trying to cram sex, drugs, rock ‘n roll, Hollywood, abandonment, haves-vs.-have-nots, inflated egos, those with fame and fortune adjacent to those with economic-physical-mental struggles, parental abuse and the after-effects, and more. Too much more. It felt jam-packed with too much unnecessary “stuff” for shock-entertainment ‘value’ in 384 pages, to me. The party, the 'epic’ party which is at the end of this story, is set in the waning days of the summer of 1983 in Malibu. It is a summer where people’s lives will change radically, some going up in flames, while others step away from the limelight, exchanging the endless rush offered by the drugs and alcohol-fueled parties, the never-ending need for attention - no matter how it is attained, for a sense of being seen. The need for adulation. To be in the limelight is the holy grail, to be ignored is a death sentence. Chronologically, this story begins in the mid 1950’s, an era that brought fame and fortune to Elvis Presley, and Rocky Marciano’s boxing career peaked, IBM released the first computer with a hard drive, racial segregation was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, Eisenhower signed the Federal Highway Act law which provided for 41,000 miles of highways across U.S., which also brought more jobs to the auto industry, and more cars onto those highways. Grace Kelly married a Prince, Disneyland became the vacation destiny for families, and The Wonderful World of Disney became a part of Sunday night television in most homes, and 'Hi-Yo, Silver!’ became a recognized introduction to The Lone Ranger. Most homes still owned black & white televisions, if they owned one at all. James Dean, John Wayne, Marilyn Monroe, Jimmy Stewart, Dean Martin, Doris Day, Rock Hudson, Frank Sinatra were some of Hollywood’s biggest, brightest stars. A different time. But this hits the fast-forward button on these lives, skipping over most of what happens in the lives of the family at the center of this story, and slowly, showing us from many (far too many) points of view what has happened, and the final repercussions of it all are revealed on the final day of this party. The connections lost, the connections made, or re-made in some cases, the damage done, the cost at the end of the day to all involved. Overall, for me, this was too disjointed, too everything but substance, it felt like it was trying 
too
 hard to be everything, and in striving for this statement of this over-the-top lifestyle it felt… flat, insipid - to me. Others have rated this 5 stars, but as much as I loved her Daisy Jones and the Six and enjoyed her Evidence of the Affair this felt like it was written by a completely different, unseasoned author cramming too much into a story, and striving for something like shock value. The shocking thing is, the ending was no shock at all.

2380,4.0,"3.5   Malibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid   Incredible, Fun, Intriguing, Wild. Ideal Choice for Beach Read. My experience with this highly anticipated book was great. It was surprising.  Malibu Rising is a book about the life of the Riva Family. Divided into two parts. In the first part, we get a glimpse of Riva's Family History. The second part is focused on the annual Riva party which in the year 1983, it got out of control.I love the relationship and the strong bond of Riva's siblings. I admire Nina for her bravery and selflessness. June's story is heart-wrenching. I liked the characters. They are well written and developed very well.The thing that made me continue reading this book are the secrets, there are secrets everywhere and that's the magic of the book. It will make it even more electrifying than it already is. This is my first book by this renowned author. But in my own experience the premise didn't live up to the whole story. It was enjoyable. It was surprisingly heartbreaking, I didn't expect such a sad book. Some parts have been written so sudden that left me so shocked. There are so many unexpected parts that'll break off so sudden and will undoubtedly bring astonishment and sadness to the readers. The plot is beautifully written in the first part but not so good in the second one. It got a little messy. This book ended dramatically and metaphorically. I initially rated this 3 stars but after some thoughts its a solid 3.5 or 4 star read. Thank you TJR, Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine and Netgalley for the early copy."
2381,3.0,"3 stars! ⭐️⭐️⭐️When I found out Taylor Jenkins Reid was coming out with a new book I was super excited about it! However, she disappointed me with this one. While I did think it was ok, I wanted to love it like I did Daisy Jones, Evelyn Hugo and all of her others that I’ve read. Four siblings (their dad is the famous rock musician, Mick Riva) - Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit all throw a big party to celebrate the end of the summer. The story takes place in the mid 1980’s during a 24 hour period all leading up to the party - with Riva family flashbacks tossed in. For me, I thought the book was good up until the actual party. It was super over-the-top and I was bored and kinda disgusted. Vandalism, fights and narcissistic a-holes acting like animals in somebody else’s home is definitely not my kind of party. I did not care about the ending - it fizzled long before that point. I know TJR has it in her to bring us something fantastic, so that’s what I’m hoping for the next go around.Thank you to NetGalley, Random House - Ballantine and Taylor Jenkins Reid for my advanced copy to read and review.

2382,3.0,"Unpopular opinion ahead...As someone who has LOOOOVED every other TJR book, I went into this with very high expectations. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver. The beginning was strong, especially the flashback portions to the 1960s of the Riva family history. The 1980s present, however, was an extremely slow burn. It felt like it was building up to an epic climax... and fell flat. It never really seemed to shock or go anywhere with intent. I am extremely grateful to have received an ARC and while I enjoyed it in parts, it's unfortunately definitely a push at 3 stars."
2383,4.0,"EXCERPT: The Malibu fire of 1983 started not in the dry hills but on the coastline. It began at 28150 Cliffside Drive on Saturday, August 27 - at the home of Nina Riva - during one of the most notorious parties in Los Angeles history. The annual party grew wildly out of control sometime around midnight. By 7:00 a.m., the coastline of Malibu was engulfed in flames. Because, just as it is in Malibu's nature to burn, so it was in one particular person's nature to set the fire and walk away. ABOUT 'MALIBU RISING': Malibu: August 1983. It's the day of Nina Riva's annual end-of-summer party, and anticipation is at a fever pitch. Everyone wants to be around the famous Rivas: Nina, the talented surfer and supermodel; brothers Jay and Hud, one a championship surfer, the other a renowned photographer; and their adored baby sister, Kit. Together the siblings are a source of fascination in Malibu and the world over--especially as the offspring of the legendary singer Mick Riva.The only person not looking forward to the party of the year is Nina herself, who never wanted to be the center of attention, and who has also just been very publicly abandoned by her pro tennis player husband. Oh, and maybe Hud--because it is long past time for him to confess something to the brother from whom he's been inseparable since birth.Jay, on the other hand, is counting the minutes until nightfall, when the girl he can't stop thinking about promised she'll be there.And Kit has a couple secrets of her own--including a guest she invited without consulting anyone.By midnight the party will be completely out of control. By morning, the Riva mansion will have gone up in flames. But before that first spark in the early hours before dawn, the alcohol will flow, the music will play, and the loves and secrets that shaped this family's generations will all come bubbling to the surface.MY THOUGHTS: Oh, this was fun! What's not to love about a dysfunctional family story set in the 1980's, an era of excess, including big hair and shoulder pads. TJR is a natural story teller. I could feel the California sunshine, the sand between my toes, and smell the clams cooking. Her characters came alive for me as I became totally immersed in the Riva family saga. And it is a saga! Told in the lead up to the party with flashbacks to the start, and then the duration of June and Mick's relationship, Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit growing up, and culminating in the party itself, this is a story set in a cauldron. I watched with bated breath as it bubbled and surged, simmered, and bubbled and surged some more until finally it boiled over. And I reveled in every moment. ⭐⭐⭐⭐.5#MalibuRising #NetGalley I: @tjenkinsreid @randomhouseT: @tjenkinsreid @@randomhouse #familydrama #historicalfiction THE AUTHOR: Taylor Jenkins Reid is the author of Malibu Rising, Daisy Jones & The Six, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, One True Loves, and three other novels.

2384,5.0,"Malibu Rising is immersive, beautiful, tragic, funny, and uplifting. Welcome to the crazy 80s.I've been all about anything written by Taylor Jenkins Reid for a while, but particularly I love this style of writing seen in Daisy Jones & The Six and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo where she writes a sort of memoir about her fictional characters - in a way that is so realistic you feel like you could type their name on Google and see them featured on Wikipedia.I'm not sure if this is a trilogy or an anthology, but Malibu Rising is set in the same universe as Evelyn Hugo (so, I'm choosing to believe Daisy Jones is part of this same world as well).  Although this book is a complete standalone, one of the protagonists of Malibu is none other than Mick Riva, aka husband number three. However, Malibu Rising is so much more than an expanded universe, it's a tour de force. Raw, emotional, nostalgic, and filled with the taste of summer afternoons and salty skin.Jenkins Reid leads us on a journey filled with heartbreak and tragedies, where it still manages to be forgiving, uplifting, and more importantly convey the wild feel of Malibu in the 80s. The setting couldn't be more perfect. Most of the book uses a style that I love - from 7 am to 7 am - narrating each hour of the fateful day of Hollywood's most talked-about party. Anyone who is anyone will be attending Nina Riva's wild bash. A party that just gets more out of control each upcoming year. No invitations are sent out, to be a part of it you just need to know where it is. But, to understand exactly how everything is going to burst up in flames in 1981 we get flashbacks to how the Riva family came to be - when Mick met June. Before he was THE Mick Riva (wildly known singer of Frank Sinatra proportions) he was just a handsome guy that knew how to carry a tune, and June was just a pretty LA girl who wanted to escape her square life.Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit are their offspring, each with their own story to tell filled with their own struggles and secrets, and in 24h (just like a perfect wave) everything will come crashing down before Malibu rises again.Go read this.Thank you Random House UK, Cornerstone, and Netgalley for the complimentary copy in exchange for an honest review.

2385,3.0,"ARC received in exchange for an honest review 🌊3.5 stars.The Riva siblings have always been close. Growing up with an absent father and a mother who grieved his abandonment meant they spent a lot of time raising themselves. The only thing they love more than each other is surfing. And possibly their one a year, huge celebrity party, at eldest sibling Nina's house. Except this year the party will be different. This year it will be the last one the siblings spend together, and by the end of the night Malibu will be burning. I always feel at ease with Taylor Jenkin Reid's writing. She can immediately set a perfect scene, in this case one of bronzed bodies, perfect waves and 80's fashion, while drawing me in with complicated characters. Each of the Riva siblings feels well developed and unique, with an important storyline of their own, yet they're also very much a unit with a history that runs deep. In particular I was drawn in by Nina's story and the sacrifices that shaped her life and personality. As the eldest she has a lot of weight on her shoulders, and every decision she makes is for the family first and foremost. She's selfless and good hearted, and the reader warms to her immediately. I did think that a lot of the secondary characters felt a little one dimensional as we are really only introduced to most of them near the last third of the story at the party (except for Tagine. I loved Tagine), but I think this only threw the Riva's even more into the spotlight. I also think that Kit was given a disservice in her character arc, as her situation is only briefly explored with no real resolution. I hope that we get Kit's own story in the future, as it's a very ambiguous ending. The novel itself is set out in sections, with part 1 framed as the countdown to the party, with flashbacks of Mick and June's love story, and part 2, which is all about the party itself and the aftermath. In each I found parts that I loved. Mick and June's story, of how they met and how everything falls apart, was a perfect set up for the later scenes. It felt very 50's, with the comfortable glamour and style that I associate with Taylor Jenkins Reid. I also loved the party itself, where we see mini insights into the lives of the other guests and the utter chaos that rains down on them all. However, I do think that I didn't really feel transplanted into the 1980s in these scenes. Aside from a brief mention of some 80s music or fashion it never really felt like this was set in anything other than the present day. And to be honest, it probably wouldn't have mattered if it was. I also found the ending rather anticlimactic z and I don't think it quite delivered on its build up. Engaging writing, loveable and complex characters, this is typical Taylor Jenkins Reid. I was just missing that dramatic conclusion that the writing implied was coming yet never arrived."

2387,5.0,"Este libro no es bueno, es excelente.Acabando Evelyn Hugo uno siempre va a su próxima novela de Taylor Jenkins Reid esperando cosas grandes. Si soy honesto, de este no tenía tantas expectativas, pero lo que me dio esta novelo fueron cosas, emociones y sentimientos aún más grandes de lo que pedía. Me dio todo y más.Los personajes son increíbles. Nina como protagonista es fascinante, ver su crecimiento, su estancamiento igual y, finalmente, su liberación se sintió catártico de leer. Es de esos personajes que te hacen sentir, vivir y pensar lo mismo que ellos. Jay, Hud y Kit se ganaron mi corazón y se que los Riva no me van a dejar. Creo que ese fue el principal diferenciado que tuve con este libro y con Evelyn Hugo. Aquí todos los personajes me gustaron. Todos. Incluso me atrevo a decir que leer a Mick Riva me gustó, porque la autora le da alma. Lo humaniza. Me sigue cayendo mal, pero ahora se siente más completo.La trama es buena. Muy buena. Me gustó demasiado conocer a los Riva actualmente y también conocer su historia detrás al mismo tiempo. Los capítulos en el pasado eran algo difíciles de leer porque estaban plagados de tragedia y tristeza, pero esa crudeza hacía que solamente me interesara más por la familia. Es un cuento de abandono familiar, resilencia y superación, uno que me dejó pensando muchas cosas. Y lo améTaylor Jenkins Reid tomó la mejor decisión al momento de escribir este libro y eso fue mostrarnos perspectivas diferentes, de personajes que no llegan a ser más que terciaros, a partir de la mitad del libro. La fiesta, el gran climax de Malibú Renace, se siente real; tangible. Logras ver los suceso desde una perspectiva 360 y eso hace que todo se siente más real, más crudo. El desorden, la locura, lo alocado. Esta fiesta fue la fiesta del siglo y puedo decir que Taylor Jenkins Reid me hizo vivirla tal como si yo hubiera sido uno de los invitados.Pero la parte donde este libro tiene su estrella es en las dinámicas familiares. En las buenas y en las malas, en las felices y en las tristes. Conocemos a los Riva con un romance fugáz y los despedimos con una vajilla rota que sus pedazos se unieron para reformarla. Aun se ven las gritas pero lo que los une es el cariño puro e incondicional que solamente encuentras en los hermanos. Fue perfecto. Nunca, NUNCA me había tocado leer una relación familiar como esta y wow. Fue espectacular.No me sorprendería si releo este libro antes de que acabe el año, incluso si es en audiolibro. Es una joya. Directo a mis favoritos de 2021 y de la vida. Gracias Taylor Jenkins Reid por darme a los Rivas."
2388,4.0,"Ahora sí, reseña de ""Malibú Renace"", por Taylor Jenkis Reid.Hay mucha polémica en torno a este libro, por el simple hecho de que la autora pasa de escribir uno de los más grandes bestsellers de este año a traernos algo muy similar y especie de historia en paralelo. Por ende, el comparar ambos libros no me parece correcto porque está muy lejos uno de otro. En primer lugar, la historia habla de la familia de Mick Riva, haciendo más hincapié en sus hijos. Los cuales montan una increíble fiesta en su casa en Malibu. A la misma concurren las celebridades más importantes del mundo y de todos los ámbitos. Si conoces la dirección de Nina Riva, estas automáticamente invitado. En base a esto, vemos problemáticas dentro de la familia y una gran cantidad de flashbacks a la infancia de los chicos y del transcurso como pareja de Mick y June. Pero a la vez, hay conflictos en el presente, por lo que todos los ambientes son ciertamente extraños, nunca podes parar a reflexionar nada ya que un hecho ocurre seguido del otro. La historia tiene mucho potencial, y por ende me gusto. Disfrute mucho la primera parte, la infancia de ellos fue durísima y leerla me resulto súper atrapante e interesante. Pero a partir de la segunda mitad, todo me pareció muy predecible. Los plots me los vi venir y hasta los había anotado en el mismo libro, y al releerlos tenía razón en todo. Pero otras personas dicen que no se lo venían venir o que les parecieron increíbles, tómenme con pinzas. ¿Lo recomiendo? Sinceramente si, y más si no leíste Los Siete Maridos de Evelyn Hugo. Porque te topas con un mundo nuevo, y te va a atrapar mucho más. Me pareció una lectura rápida, ágil y que valore muchísimo, pero no creo que sea alucinante. 7,5/10.(Comenten que les pareció). "
2389,5.0,"Taylor Jenkins Reid hits it out of the park again with this over-the-top read. I had to pick this book up since I loved Daisy Jones & the Six. This book is about family drama, heartbreak, struggle to survive, heartbreak, and relationships. Set in Malibu, home of the rich and famous, with the backdrop of surfing and beaches, and its history of burning. It centers on the Mick Riva family with all their flaws. The lifestyles of the rich and famous are front and center contrasted with the poor and downtrodden trying to succeed. Interesting characters all around, and Nina is a strong and courageous female protagonist. This is not a book to pass up - I couldn't put it down and don't want to give anything away - just know it's great and I loved it!Thanks to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine through Netgalley for an advance copy! "
2390,5.0,"rating: 5/5⭐️Creo que la mejor decisión que se puede tomar es entrar a este libro sin saber nada de él. Este es mi primer libro de Taylor que leo, y me sorprendió mucho la historia y la forma de escribir de la autora.La forma en que se narra un paralelo entre el pasado y presente de los personajes y sus historias es muy lindo y te mantiene intrigado. Uno se pregunta qué decisiones tomaron para llegar al punto en el que están actualmente y es frustrante y triste ver cómo los errores se van repitiendoQuiero comentar muy poco por temas de spoiler y que realmente les recomiendo que vayan sin saber mucho! Lo que sí les puedo decir es que vayan con una cajita de pañuelos preparada porque algunos de los diálogos y escenas en este libro realmente tocan el corazón🥺🥺"
2391,4.0,"The twenty seven miles of coastline off the Pacific Coast Highway, about thirty miles west of Downtown Los Angeles is known to comprise some of the most expensive real estate on the planet. Malibu is the retreat of the rich and famous, with an average home value in the millions of dollars. But it wasn’t always that way. In her latest novel, Taylor Jenkins Reid tells the story of four children who grew up along this stretch of land and of their parents who met here. It’s a bitter sweet tale which not only tells the bigger story but also, in alternating chapters, focuses on how the children, now teenage to early twenties in age, prepare for the party of the year. Mick Riva is an aspiring singer hanging out on the beach when he spots June, the daughter of the owners of a local restaurant, posing in her new bikini. Immediately attracted, Mick wastes no time in introducing himself and then wooing her with his slick manners and confident ambition. He will one day be famous, he tells her, and he’ll buy her the house of her dreams. And he’s true to his word, when the bookings start to mount up and the path to fame and fortune begins to look like it might actually transpire he buys the beach house he always promised her he would. The children (Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit) follow as Mick becomes a singing sensation in the 1950’s. In 1983, Nina awakes to a day she is dreading. It’s the date of the annual party she is due to throw at her massive house on Point Dume, set high above the beach. But things are not right in her life and she’s not sure she wants to be surrounded by lots of people today. However, Nina is survivor and a doer so she steels herself to just get on with it. Her first job is to meet up with her younger siblings at the family restaurant she’s now responsible for, and then maybe hit the beach for a spot of surfing. The way it works is if you know the address of the party venue then you’re invited – Nina is expecting lots of guests tonight. The way the story is structured is clever, in that as I worked through the preparations for the party – each chapter ticking off another hour – I was alternatively absorbing the bigger family story and gradually becoming more and more invested in the fate of all of the characters. In truth, there aren’t too many surprises in the main body of the book but a number of threads are clearly readying themselves to come together when the party finally gets started. Some people are going to get hurt and each of the family members - at least, those still standing - will face a moment of truth. It’s a light, easy read and I enjoyed getting to know Mick, June, Nina and the others. There is a decent amount of drama here together with good character development, and the setting is brought to life really well by the author. Malibu a place I once fleetingly passed through during a road trip holiday a few years back but it’s somewhere I now want to visit properly, if only drink in the atmosphere of the place and see how the other half live. Though regretfully I don’t think I’ll be divvying up for a beach house any time soon.My thanks to Random House UK, Cornerstone and NetGalley for providing a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
2392,4.0,"I am officially a TJR fangirl. Mick Riva comes back from my favorite TJR book The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and we follow the lives of his children - Nina, Hud, Jay and Kit. I loved learning about the children and their mother June. Watching them grow up in the through the 1970s and 1980s was like a throwback I welcomed (although it makes me feel so old). The siblings fall in love with surfing and we watch them grow up until Nina becomes a fan favorite surfer model. She throws an annual beach bash every year that all the hottest celebs attend (I'm thinking a version of the grotto parties at Playboy). I loved the writing in this one. The circle of the dry landscape and constant wildfires in Malibu in the beginning and the end was the icing on the proverbial writing cake for me. I loved watching and learning about the relationship between these four children. I think some were better developed than others- but there were moments of each that I found enduring with Nina and Hud being my absolute favorites. I loved the tiny snippets of the hundreds (sarcasm?) of side characters, but I had to constantly tell my brain  I don't think she quite pulled this off, it muddled the narrative and took away from the main characters for me. I cringed at some of the ridiculous behavior of the party guests -- hanging from chandeliers, broken china, drugs, public indecency, and peeing on artwork! I enjoyed the dual timeframes of the 12 hours leading up to/including the final Riva party and the past of growing up a Riva child. "
2393,5.0,We'll shit. Taylor has done it again. Was this book better than the 7 husbands of Evelyn Hug? The answer is NOOOOOOOOO. But it was still a pretty good fucking read. It was giving very much so outer banks vibes but the only difference is that the characters are older and richer. TJK found a way to make this simple story phenomenally thrilling. Her writing style can only be described as enchantingly glamorous. WARNING: This book is extremely straight. I know I was shocked as well. But I guess reading about straight people giving head is also fine *sigh*. ANYWAYS great book definitely recommend. The hardcover was like 30 FUCKING DOLLARS THO so there's no shame in waiting for the softcover to come out! 
2394,5.0,"An entertaining read that is very identifiable in terms of hopes, dreams, insecurities, and failures.We all have a part of us that wonders what it’s like to be “on top of our game,” to be successful, the best, perhaps a celebrity, even just living life where we think the grass is greener. No matter what anyone tells us about the grass not being greener, we still secretly harbor dreams that it will be better for us. It’s hard to imagine that feeling of being on top, of being the best, of being the one that everyone looks up to, is less than wonderful in any way. We’re winning, so to speak, how can that be bad? But when we get to the top, to the best, we see that we still have the same doubts and insecurities as when we were unknown. And maybe now we have different worries and concerns that are equally important to those we had as an average person.In the end, no matter who you are, where you go, or what you do, each of us harbors doubts and insecurities, and struggles to come to terms with building a future that fulfills our hopes and dreams and allows us to form our own unique and very personal identity.I found it very hard to write a proper review for this great read, but I enjoyed it much more than I anticipated."
2395,4.0,"Me ha gustado mucho conocer la historia de los hermanos Riva. Hijos de Mike Riva, un famoso cantante de Hollywood. Es una historia en la que los cuatro hermanos no lo han tenido fácil, sobretodo Nina, la mayor y también nos explica la historia de los padres de cómo se enamoraron y todo lo que fue pasando en su relación, cómo sus decisiones terminaron afectando a sus hijos. La autora ha querido reflejar otra vez la parte mala de la fama y las consecuencias que esta puede acarrear, no solamente al famoso sino también a las personas que lo rodean. Te atrapa des del principio, es una montaña rusa de sentimientos pero también de personajes que van apareciendo ya que todos son muy distintos entre ellos. Parece que a la autora le gusta la fama y todo lo que puede suponer esta, también parece estar conectado sus libros: Todos quieren a Daisy Jones, Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo y este. Este no se lleva las cinco estrellas porque a pesar que me ha enganchado y no paran de suceder cosas... me ha faltado profundidad en algunas partes que he considerado importante, como por ejemplo los sentimientos de Nina."
2396,5.0,"Be sure to visit my Favorites Shelf for the books I found most entertaining.
The local Santa Ana winds speed through the mountains and valleys from the inland to the shore, hot and strong. Myth says they are agents of chaos and disorder. But what they really are is an accelerant.
NEW FAVORITE 💙 Malibu Rising is a fantastic book from start to finish. I enjoyed every minute of it. The plot is interesting, the characters engaging. I have nothing else to say except you need to read this."
2397,4.0,All I can say is Taylor Jenkins Reid has done it again. I really fell in love with the Riva children and I only hope we will revisit them someday.
2398,4.0,"*staring at the wall thinking exclusively about how much love these siblings have for each other* 🥺This book is literally so out of my comfort zone I can't believe I actually connected this much with it. Historical fiction is not a genre I lean towards but this book won my heart in the end. Like, I came here to read about Malibu and surfing and I got the most heartwarming depiction of a family I've ever seen in my life.I have to say I preferred the first half to the second one when the party started. Reading about June and Mick, and about Nina, Jay, Hud, Kit both as children and as they were getting ready for the party had me obsessed. This book could have definitely been a 5 stars if it had continued in that direction. The party was underwhelming in comparison; with all that build-up I thought something would just explode. I mean, the party was fine (I loved the Nina-Mick face off, for example), but it wasn't as grand as I was expecting. Also, I didn't like how the povs kept switching between the main characters and the strangers attending the party. I completely understand why the author did it, but as a reader I can say it took away part of the focus that had been built for at least 200 pages on the main characters. And that's a shame.I loved the siblings with all my heart and I saw a piece of myself in all of them by the end. I cared about them so so much! TJR did that. She also made me fall for Mick Riva at the beginning just like June did, and I'm ashamed of myself lol. I can't believe I thought TJR couldn't make me possibly hate him but oooh she did. But looking at it from another perspective, he's probably the best and most complex character in the book.To conclude, Malibu Rising was a detour in my reading life I would happily take again. It was exactly what I needed to come out of a little audiobook slump I was in: it was engaging from beginning to end, and the writing made me immediately care about every single one of the characters, which is not something I experience every day."

When there is only you, you do not get to choose which jobs you want, you do not get to decide you are incapable of anything. There is no room for distaste or weakness. You must do it all. All of the ugliness, the sadness, the things most people can't stand to even think about, all must live inside of you. You must be capable of everything.

i may have cried a lot of times in here. screw that. I definitely cried a ton while reading malibu rising. on her suggestive poses, in tight bikinis, and while the malibu waves crashing against her, nina ""cool surfer girl"" riva became every man's fantasy. she braved through life standing as the sole parent to her three younger siblings after their father left them for another woman. also, i just want to point out how reid owns the cheating trope. usually i'm not that bothered when used as plot device but in here it hurts so deep. if you love this author's works, do not miss this one out. 

""And I've been really sad,"" Nina added. ""That I… that I meant so little to someone who had made me believe I meant so much.""

To finally rank all tjr books!→ one true loves - 5 stars→ the seven husbands of evelyn hugo - 5 stars→ maybe in another life - 5 stars→ malibu rising - 4 stars→ forever, interrupted - 4 stars→ evidence of the affair - 3 stars→ daisy jones & the six - 3 stars→ after i do - 2 stars"
2400,4.0,"Read this one with a group and found it entirely delightful. It was impossible not to love the Riva's and TJR nailed it again with her back and forth dialogue and timestamps without any confusion or loss of storyline. It was interesting to unpack the idea of nature vs nurture when it comes to the imprint parents leave on their growing children and how it might shape who they become, and the ending was a satisfying conclusion of all characters and their arcs. A perfect summer read. "
2401,5.0,"4.5/5Song/s the book brought to mind: Save Your Tears by The WeekndMan, I loved this book. Malibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid is a story about family but also about fire, and a whole lot of other characters as well. I loved the Malibu setting and the surfing aspect, and of course, I always love TJR's writing. I feel like her style is always slightly different in every book I read, but it always hits you where it counts. This book made me laugh out loud, shed some tears, and kept me hooked the entire time. I knew as soon as I read the first few words that I was going to love it and I'm glad I did!The Riva family story broke my heart in more ways than one, but it also showed such strength through Nina and other characters. I loved every single one of the siblings and my heart hurt for June, but Mick was a bastard, and you'll find out why. However awful he was, when you learn his backstory, you can understand why he became the way he is. I couldn't believe how powerful this story was for the present time considering it's told in just twenty-four hours. There are also chapters set in the past, and through many character's eyes and some omniscient narrating, you find out a lot of information in both time periods. It all comes together at the very end to find out who started the fire which added a mystery element as well. Malibu Rising is not a light read and I would keep some tissues handy, but it's another stunning novel from the queen of fiction.I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own."
2402,5.0,i cried during daisy jones & the six.i sobbed during the seven husbands of evelyn hugo. you would think i would learn my lesson and realize i was going to shed some tears during malibu rising. but NOPE i was not ready at all.wow such a great story. i come from a big family myself so i found the sibling dynamic in this book to be incredibly heartwarming. as the youngest i saw myself in kit. i just wanted to give that whole family a hug AND BOY DID I WANT TO SLAP MICK RIVA!!!!!!! such a great story. taylor jenkins reid never disappoints. 5/5 stars!!! 
2403,5.0,oh my GOD...
2404,5.0,"I have read four novels by Taylor Jenkins Reid and loved them all. Her stories captivate me from the very beginning until the very end.Malibu Rising is a story about family, fame and how the choices parents make affect their children.Beautiful writing that is both heartbreaking and heartwarming."
2405,2.0,"I'm not sure what happened here but I found Malibu Rising disconnected, predictable and over the top.The book has a dual timeline, one that describes a summer day of 1983 when Nina Riva - a famous model - and her 3 siblings host their annual party in Malibu and a second one which follows the backstory of how Nina's parents June and Mick met and the tough upbringing of the Riva siblings. I enjoyed reading parts about the relationship between Nina's parents and Mick's rise to fame even though I did feel I've seen it all before. The book as a whole felt very disjointed and some scenes and characters were overly exaggerated making me roll my eyes several times. I understand this is supposed to be the world of celebrities which to ordinary people like myself often seems remote, but I felt the author really overdid it here and tried cramming in too many Hollywood stereotypes. There were also a ridiculous numer of random characters introduced that didn't add anything to the story and I couldn't see the point. I think the hardcore TJR fans will enjoy the novel but perhaps will agree this is not her best.Many thanks to the publisher for my review copy in exchange for an honest review. "
2406,5.0,"Ugh Perfection.The sibling relationship in this book was beautifully portrayed and made me tear up. Once again 5 stars aren't fucking enough for Taylor Jenkins Reid books.

Granted the UK cover is not a fav but it's Taylor Jenkins Reid so it's fine. How did I ever think the cover wasn't pretty, It's absolutely beautiful ❤️. One last thing, break my heart and make me sob Malibu Rising😭"
2407,4.0,Miss TJR did it again. The writing in this is flawless. I loved the characters and the pacing. I'd still put Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones ahead of this one but it still was a fantastic new release.Booktube | Instagram | Twitter
2408,5.0,"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Genre: Historical + Family SagaBoy, Taylor Jenkins Reid knows how to write a story! I was expecting to like this book but not to love it. I am a big fan of her book The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo but that was more outlandish. Daisy Jones was a nice story but it didn’t reach the level of Evelyn Hugo for me. Malibu Rising does it but with a little less showbiz glitter. This is the story of a dysfunctional family that goes through a lot of ups and downs. The story is told in two different timelines, the present (1983) and the past going back to the 1950s and advancing through the years until the present. I loved how the author handled the flow of time and events. I usually get worried when a book has more than one timeline because many tend to get confusing. That was not the case with this beautiful tale.There is lots of drama here, so if like me, that is your thing then you will enjoy this book a lot. The story is more character-driven and digs deep into each one of the characters. TJR has done a tremendous job with these characters and building their personalities. I enjoyed reading about the three generations especially June and Mick. At some point, I thought Nina would also repeat her mother’s mistake despite seeing the whole thing with her own eyes. But fortunately, the author gives us a totally different outcome, thanks to Carrie! Nina is the main protagonist. Although the other siblings have important roles as well, Nina is the one who goes through more hardship than others. I just loved her relationship with her siblings and how she took over from her mom in taking care of them. Another silent character in the story is Surfrider Beach. I adored the characters’ relationship with the beach and surfing since they were kids. To me, it felt like Malibu and the beach were the two parents who were taking care of these kids when they had no one. It was just beautiful!The story has several emotional moments that will stay with you after you finish reading it. It is a thought-provoking book for sure that starts on a high note and ends on one too. Absolutely loved it and looking forward to the author’s next. "
2409,4.0,"3.5 stars - I initially gave this book 3.75 but now I settled on 3.5, although the rating of stars is going to stay the same.I thought by listening to the audiobook would make my experience with the book so much better. Alas, it stayed the same, but I'm not complaining. I still enjoyed reading this the second time around. ********************************************It's been only a few months since I read this book, but weirdly I barely remember it.I had been planning to do a reread whenever I got the chance for the audiobook and now I have.I'm curious to see if I'm going to change my rating based on the audiobook.************************3.75For now I'm rounding up this book to 4 stars, but I won't be posting a full review until I listen to the audiobook as well. ************************Just got this from the bookstore."
2410,4.0,"Alright!I loved it!This is what I needed, after a stressful week. A brainless but engaging entertainment.If you love soap opera (or fairy tales) you may enjoy this book, but be warned that there is nothing special about the storyline, but what makes it good and how the story is told.I thought that the structure was brilliant.There is enough drama to make this book somewhat gripping, even though the drama of the rich, beautiful and famous seems so shallow.But shallow or not, I love the way TJR writes. I think that she is very talented.I can easily see this book being adapted for the screen."

2412,3.0,"3 ""riding the wave to minority island"" stars! This was my June BOTM, and even though I'm not a drop-everything-and-read-Taylor-Jenkins-Reid reader, I was excited for this one. I love the cover, and the premise of a raucous, Malibu surfing family drama sounded promising; but in staying with the theme here, for me it was like a wave that looks massive coming in, but peters out before it even breaks the shoreline. It was just a bit underwhelming. It is a family drama that lacked any real drama. It is set in Malibu in August of 1983, and the majority of the book takes place over the course of 24 hours. It focuses on the four children of legendary singer Mick Riva, and his wife, June. Through flashbacks, June and Mick's ""love story"" unfolds, and you get a glimpse into the lives of the four children as well. You are also set up from page one to realize that Malibu is prone to fires, and that the annual Riva party ends in flames. I liked the foreshadowing of disaster, but ultimately it didn't deliver. The best parts for me were the chapters about the relationship of June and Mick Riva, which seemed to be a perfect wave, but quickly crashed down with Mick's rise to fame. June's struggles and her love/hate relationship with the family restaurant spoke to me, and I also liked how Jenkins Reid tied in Mick and June's relationship with each of their children, and its profound effect on each of them - but that was it when it came to the four siblings. The present day parts of the book about the lives of the siblings were just not that exciting or dramatic, and I didn't think any of the four were overly likeable or unforgettable. I cared only marginally about what would happen them. The annual Riva party was where it all went downhill for me though, as it seemed to last forever and a day, with excessive name-dropping of mainly fictitious people - what was the point of that?! So many baseless, secondary characters were introduced that it lost me, and I found myself skimming the party pages. Every few pages, an actual celebrity's name would be thrown in the mix, but not enough to make it feel believable or to keep me invested.The ending was okay but it lacked any real depth, as it was a bit too happily-ever-after to give it that true-to-life family drama feel. I have no doubt I'm in the minority with this review, but it was just a lackluster read for me. "
2413,5.0,"Rating: 4.5 starsThis is 100% the show Shameless but make it Hollywood, you can't change my mind. Hands down, this is my favorite TJR book so far. If you're going into this looking for some wild raging summer party as the main part of the story you'll definitely be let down. The party was just mainly rich, privileged drunk assholes doing drugs and breaking everything in Nina's house. However, if you like more of a character driven story this will probably be hard to put down for you. To say I adored Nina and her siblings in this book is an understatement. I honestly can't remember the last time I flew through a book the way I did Malibu Rising. I found myself picking this up every second I had to read more of Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit's upbringing (where Nina had to take over the role of both parents) as well as finding out how each of the siblings secrets would catch up with them by the end of the night of the party. Nina's character development was just *chef's kiss*. Ugh, I could gush over it forever but.....spoilers.On top of loving the characters I also loved the writing, which doesn't really come as a surprise since I've had good reading experiences with TJR's books so far. I think the way the story was set up with flash backs to the past vs. hourly updates the day and night of the party is what really had me flying through this. I had to see how the party was going to unravel but also had to see how Nina and her siblings would adapt to whatever shitty hand life threw them as kids. It flowed extremely well in my opinion.Overall, I would totally recommend this for anyone looking for a beach read filled with looooots of drama, major character development, and a story that's just one hell of an emotional rollercoaster.P.S. - Mick Riva is absolute trash but I loved how his presence connected this book to The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones and The Six."
2414,5.0,"Full detailed review is up on my blog: https://www.crumbledpages.com/malibu-...Malibu Rising is the story about one unforgettable night in the life of the Riva siblings set in Malibu of August 1983. Nina Riva's annual summer party is the wildest and most coveted party of Malibu and this year this party will end in flames. The story is about the four Riva siblings. Nina, the oldest one, who sacrifed so much for her family that she is almost like a mother to the other three. After losing their mother, she was the one to bring up her younger siblings. But she isn't looking forward to the party and she doesn't want to be the center of attention. Hud is nervous to attend the party because he is due a confession to his brother, Jay. Jay, on the other hand, is excited for the party because he invited the girl of his dreams to the party. And Kitt, who is on her path of self discovery but she also invited someone without consulting anyone. But by the morning the party goes out of hand and at the end Nina Riva's house is ablaze and burning. What made me love this book immensely was the storytelling and the story itself. TJR is a master of storytelling as we have seen with The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones and The Six. The way she interweaves all the character's storylines into one big picture is amazing. I loved how family was at the heart of the story. I adored the relationship and love between the four siblings. They cared for each other so much and had the loss of their mother among them as an open wound. They loved each other deeply despite being so different from one another. Regardless their differences, they shared a beautiful bond."
2415,3.0,"I liked this more than Daisy Jones but less than Evelyn Hugo so... 3.5 stars. I hated the parents’ storyline but did enjoy the Riva kids, as messy as they were. On a side note, why does TJR love writing about cheating husbands so much!!!!"
2416,2.0,"I was a huge fan of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s last two books, Daisy Jones and the Six and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. It seemed like she had finally found her niche, writing novels about the messy private lives of celebrities with plenty of plot twists. And it seemed like Malibu Rising -- about the adult children of a rock star – would fit into that niche nicely. Unfortunately, though, this one was just a mess. This novel covers the span of 24 hours in the life of the four adult Riva children, the day of oldest daughter Nina’s annual party at her Malibu mansion. Mick Riva had been a rock star in the 1960s, which meant that the four children had a fairly turbulent childhood and as the hours tick past and the party approaches, Reid uses flashbacks to explore the past: how Mick wooed their mother and how the children relied on each other to get through their shared trauma. And honestly? I think there was just too much going on here. There were extraneous threads that followed people who really had nothing to do with the Rivas, each Riva had POV chapters with their own drama (and there was a lot of drama so it sometimes was difficult to keep it all straight). The characters never really came to life for me and the resolution of central hook -- from the outset, we know that the party will end with Nina's house burning down -- was so unsatisfying that I found myself why we needed the fire in the story at all. Though I did just realize that Mick Riva was one of seven husbands from Evelyn Hugo, so that's a fun little twist. I actually wish that this book felt as thoroughly engrossing as that one had been. "

2421,5.0,"Taylor Jenkins Reid, ‘TJR’ as we lovingly call her, has written a saga, a mid-century, Hollywood, California, Family Saga. Think ‘Rat Pack’ than ‘Brat Pack,’ Sinatra, Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. in the 60’s, than Lowe, Estevez and Judd Nelson in the 80’s. The Riva name in Southern California was very big in the eighties, but it all started very small in the transition from the ‘Crooner Era’ ending in the 50’s and the start of Rock in the 60’s. Settle in, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.Mick Riva left the dark streets of his neighborhood in NYC as soon as he could. The sunshine and beach scene in California definitely appealed to him. The small town of Malibu, right on the coast, was perfect for surfing, something he was just learning to do when he was distracted by a beautiful, young girl. He charms her to marry him with promises he’ll give her everything she’d ever want. He does, for a while. Soon, Mick got swept away with his celebrity and charmed every woman he met, promising that first girl he’ll be back. Four kids later he left for good. The Riva kids raised themselves while their mother worked and waited for the man, she trusted but who could love only himself.Each child grows up a Riva kid, with that famous name like an invisible tag stitched onto their foreheads. Eventually that tag will become more a label, maybe even a curse. Each child really had no relationship with their father or enjoyed any of the benefits from his fame and fortune. They lived a modest life in a single-parent home.Mick’s absence affected each kid differently:Nina – the eldest, was her mother’s ‘right-hand-man,’ in ways that a father assists a mother in helping with raising kids. After their mother dies, Nina completely takes on all the family responsibilities at a young age. She’s famous for surfing but also for her beauty, but she only does the sexy photos to earn money for the family.Jay – the eldest son. Is constantly trying to impress his father by pushing himself surfing. He takes risks to be the best. Hud – the half-brother. Even though he knows he’s loved by his siblings, he always thinks about his biological mother giving him up. He knows the circumstances and is so happy that June took him in and loved him as her own.Kit – the youngest. Kit never knew her father, so she wants to show him that she doesn’t need him. Yet, she wants to impress him, and then say F.Y. on her own terms.We are here, August 1983, the day of the Riva’s final night of the summer party. We’re at Nina’s home up on a cliff preparing for maybe a hundred ‘A-Listers’ from L.A. to show up, and a hundred more of their fans, groupies, etc. to wander in as well. It will be a night to remember for the Riva kids and many of the party goers too.The saga comes to an epic close the night or maybe morning of this famous party, as well it should.Thank you Netgalley, Ballantine Books, and TJR aka Taylor Jenkins ReidScoop: Mick Riva was Evelyn Hugo’s third husband. From TJR’s book, ‘The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo.’"
2422,3.0,"A very solid 3.5/5 stars! (this means I did like it overall, I just didn't love love it :))This was a very entertaining & addicting story, one stained with daddy issues, infidelity, and alcoholism. So many characters doing a number of detestable things! I nearly cried at one part, laughed in others, and felt disgusted reading other parts. I loved the '80s Malibu setting, and the general laid-back surfer/beachy atmosphere that drenched the pages. TJR has a way of describing a time & place in such a way that you genuinely feel like you're missing out because you, the reader, are not there with the characters. I felt this same way about Daisy Jones & the Six, but even more. Ha, I do love love Daisy Jones & the Six. Read that if you haven't already!!Nearly every character in this book is flawed to various degrees, but that's not a downside at all. I just didn't feel all that attached to any one character, despite relating to some of the issues the Riva children faced regarding a parent letting them down multiple times. I also kept coming away from this story with a feeling of general unease and sadness, and not in a good way. The scenes in part two, at the party, just read so empty and hollow. I felt bad for the characters who were either tripping on LSD, smoking pot, or sleeping with a stranger...Just so depressing, honestly. I didn't quite understand why we got all those little snapshots of such inconsequential characters. I didn't feel like it added much of anything to the story.Other than that, though, it was certainly a compelling story about the Riva family! Gosh, I detested Mick though. He's terrible. "
2423,4.0," Thanks to NetGalley and Penguin Random House Canada for an egalley in exchange for an honest review. One of my most anticipated reads of 2021 from one of my absolute favourite authors, Malibu Rising surrounds the four Riva siblings( Nina, Jay, Hudson, and Kit) in 1983 Malibu. It is also the whirlwind love story and tumultuous marriage of their parents, June and Mick in 1956 and the years of family events that follow. The novel specifically focuses on the day of Nina's Malibu Party, one that from the beginning of the story is hinted to be completely memorable.   And Nina felt a sense of doom, as she imagined how the night would play out. The conflict, the mess. This night, Nina could feel in her gut, was not going to end well.  Having read all of TJR'S books, it never ceases to amaze me how quickly I fall in love with all of her characters and become so invested in all their stories. What did surprise me was losing myself so totally in the surf scene. I was almost convinced that I needed that among my hobbies. Just kidding. I think I will just stick with reading books and watching movies about it. Through the descriptions and cultural references, I was certainly digging the 80's. There's a lot of characters that intersect with the Riva family, but TJR does make them just as memorable and fascinating as her main protagonists. Not to mention the dramatic adventures that take place during the ""party of the decade."" I don't really have any criticisms because I highly enjoyed the storyline and was captivated from beginning to end.  The perfect beach read! I mean, that cover alone begs to be adored!Goodreads review published 24/05/21Expected Publication Date 04/06/21"

2426,4.0,"A few months ago I read Daisy Jones & the six and really enjoyed it so decided I would like to read more. This is not normally the sort of cover or book description that draws me in but read it purely on the strength of her previous book. For me this was a book that fell into the category ‘the more I read, the more I enjoyed it’, certainly not at the level of Daisy Jones but a decent read.Malibu Rising is a story about one unforgettable night in the life of the Riva family, where each individual family member will have life changing decisions to make. A book full of the good and bad in family life and all the upset and joy along the way. There is lots of love in the Riva family where the siblings have always had each other to help make their way through the difficult times. Nina, Jay, Kit and Hud have a very close bond and look out for their mother June who struggles to get by.Through the book we learn of the siblings struggles and successes with the story concluding with the annual party in Malibu that will change the families life forever.A book about relationships and family bonds that I am glad I continued with.I would like to thank both Netgalley and Random House UK for supplying a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."
2427,5.0,"Wow I absolutely loved this book!!! Although it had a slow beginning it also sets the reader up as it includes background knowledge and insight to the characters past. I throughly enjoyed the format when the author intertwines the 50’s and the 80’s and often dedicates brief chapters to characters. Although I haven’t read daisy jones and the 6 and the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo, it’s definitely on my list and includes references in this book. However, sometimes I felt like there were a little bit too many characters that if felt hard to digest, but they’re all so so different and unique it wasn’t hard to tell who they were. Overall, I CANT wait to read more of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s books and this is definitely something you should pick up!!!! "

Malibu: August, 1983. It's the day of Nina Riva's annual end-of-summer party, and anticipation is at a fever pitch. Everyone wants to be around the famous Rivas: Nina, the talented surfer and supermodel; brothers Jay and Hud, one a championship surfer, the other a renowned photographer; and their adored baby sister, Kit. Together, the siblings are a source of fascination in Malibu and the world over-especially as the offspring of the legendary singer, Mick Riva.The only person not looking forward to the party of the year is Nina herself, who never wanted to be the center of attention, and who has also just been very publicly abandoned by her pro tennis player husband. Oh, and maybe Hud-because it is long past time to confess something to the brother from whom he's been inseparable since birth.Jay, on the other hand, is counting the minutes until nightfall, when the girl he can't stop thinking about promised she'll be there.And Kit has a couple secrets of her own-including a guest she invited without consulting anyone.By midnight the party will be completely out of control. By morning, the Riva mansion will have gone up in flames. But before that first spark in the early hours before dawn, the alcohol will flow, the music will play, and the loves and secrets that shaped this family's generations will all come bubbling to the surface.

“Just because it is in Malibu's nature to burn, so was it in one particular person's nature to set fire and walk away.”

Fun fact, this is my first TJR book ever, and it's needless to say I loved it! I was hooked from the beginning. The author has such an interesting and magnificent way to craft the story and her writing style is so unique I immediately fell in love. A good writing style always helps improve the whole story.the characters:Ahh my found family heart is sobbing right now, these charcters were everything <33~ Nina Riva“Must be nice. To be able to be weak. I wouldn’t know.”AHH LOVE HER SO SO MUCH, SHE DESERVES LOVE TOO!!  ~Jay Riva“what makes surfing feel like more than sport: It requires destiny to be on your side, the ocean must favor you.”I really liked him, he's cool :)~Hud Riva“Hud would love his child the way his mother had loved him: actively, every day, and without ambiguity.”I liked him too, he's sweet ~Kit Riva“She was pretty sure she did not want to kiss any guy at all”My sweet baby, I love her, a girlboss honestly Probably the best part of the book were the characters!The sibling relationship in this book was beautifully portrayed and made me tear up. 🥺💕 Everyone is a complete character, and I loved seeing how they interact and come to some big realizations over the course of the novel.

“They will not know what the future holds or if their paths will ever cross again. But they will feel that - for one night at least - someone has seen them as they have always wanted to be seen. And that will be enough.”

2429,4.0,"The Riva siblings all share a love for the ocean and each other but are as unlike as any four individuals can be. The eldest sibling, Nina, is hosting her infamous end-of-season party, which is usually a great source of joy for all four of them. This year, however, each is dealing with their own crises, which they are attempting to keep from the others and are fearful that the party will be the setting where all is revealed.I loved how this novel was formatted. The novel took place over twenty-four hours and the reader was provided with the timeframe of 7am to 7pm, in part one, and 7pm to 7am, in part two, as chapter headings. It added an ominous layer to an already mysterious narrative to feel the time oppressively ticking down to the conclusion.Intersecting these chapters were snippets from June and Mick Riva, their parents. The portions following them detailed how they met, fell in love, and then fell out of it. Witnessing their grown-up selves after being provided with details of their childhood versions added poignancy to the novel and ensured I loved the siblings all the more.This was a very human novel. This is the best way I can describe it. There were scenes of action and sinister intent but the ones of high emotion and suffering were the ones I remained most drawn to. Despite the very privileged lives the siblings led, all they were dealing with were very relatable issues and I thought Taylor Jenkins Reid sensitively and accurately tackled them.I don't know what story I was expecting after the tumultuous The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which I absolutely adored, but it wasn't this. This was a far quieter story and it showcased how this author can craft characters that, whether in or out of the media's attention, have me longing to gravitate towards the inner-light she grants them with. I received this book in exchange for an honest review. Thank you to the author, Taylor Jenkins Reid, and the publisher, Cornerstone, for this opportunity."
2430,3.0,"Decent read, fast paced but not remarkable. I have really enjoyed some of this author's books, and some of them I have found to be just ok. Malibu Rising falls squarely into the ""just ok"" category. The good:The 1980s setting was a bit nostalgic for me, because that's when I grew up so I could relate to many of the references. I liked Nina and her siblings, but I felt like Nina's story was the only one truly fleshed out and developed. I appreciated her journey and was rooting for her all the way through. The development of Mick and June's relationship was also well portrayed. I could feel for June and ached with her as Mick made one bad choice after another. The story arc of her alcoholism was incredibly true to the 70s/80s where pretty much everything was swept under the rug and hidden, no one confronted each other and had interventions. The not-so-good:Mick was a true asshole. There's no other way to describe him. I couldn't relate to him at all and was SO glad for the ending confrontation with the kids.The parts about the party were just icky and drawn out, yet they were also choppy and I had no connection to them at all. It felt like the author wrote those scenes as if for a screenplay, a series of vignettes that would play much better on the screen than on the page. Even so, they were filler at the expense of character development.Although I liked the siblings, their story arcs were underdeveloped and shallow. They each had issues but none of them were explored to the extent of Nina's and ended up being kind of throw-away within the big picture.Overall like I said above. It's not a bad book. I got through it really quickly, probably because there's not much depth or even much plot. Nothing fresh, nothing new, would make a decent beach read.I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book, all opinions are my own. "
2431,5.0,"Terminei ""Malibu Renasce"" há algumas horas e ainda não consegui processar tudo o que senti. Não é uma história apenas sobre Mick Riva, celebridades e sentimentos equivocados; é também sobre perdas, medos e falhas. É um livro extremamente emocional que bagunçou o meu coração. No entanto, é impossível evitar comparações com ""Daisy Jones & The Six"" ou ""Os Sete Maridos de Evelyn Hugo"", mas assim que comecei percebi que seria um livro totalmente diferente e ainda mais maduro. ""Malibu Renasce"" é sobre ser humano, sobre como erramos tentando acertar e como cada um de nós carrega um fardo deixado por nossas famílias. Uma série de erros que passamos a vida toda carregando em nossos ombros como se fôssemos nós os culpados. É uma história contada por personagens quebrados tentando reencontrar o seu lugar no mundo, não é um livro com inúmeras reviravoltas, mas é um livro verdadeiro, real e extremamente triste. Muitas pessoas vão se identificar com a história dos Riva como eu, outros vão simplesmente achar mais do mesmo. Mas quem já leu algo da Taylor Jenkins Reid, sabe: suas histórias sempre deixam algo com quem as lê e assim como o fogo que queima Malibu de tempos em tempos, às vezes precisamos deixar algumas coisas para trás e seguir em frente. Recomendo a leitura, mas também deixo aqui o alerta para gatilhos familiares. Obrigado Editora Paralela pela ARC e por me permitir ler essa história e ser arrebatado por ela."

2434,1.0,"My wife and I love to play this game called “would you rather.” It’s a pretty simple concept, really: you take two moderately related situations or afflictions or whatever, pit them against one another and select your preference. On paper it sounds lame; its fun is derived mostly from imagination and/or creativity. Together now for nearly two decades, my better half and I have played hundreds upon hundreds of rounds of “would you rather.” Sometimes the topics are arbitrary; for instance, “would you rather it be one season all year round, or all four?” Others are more elaborate; last November we’d asked: “would you rather Trump be President another 4 years, or bathe in battery acid for the rest of your life?” (FTR, we both chose the latter.)Most of the time, the answer is insignificant if not ultimately ignored; it’s the details of the question which makes it so fun. One topic which frequently comes up is food – and given how long Emily and I have been together, coupled with the amount of food we’ve shared through this time, one could imagine how ostentatious our games have become. As native Midwesterners it should come as no surprise our affinity for dairy products. Milk, ice cream, yogurt, you name it. Above all, we love cheese, so much so it wouldn’t be unlike us to just dips our hands into bags of the shredded stuff and shovel them into our mouths. You can thank me later for that bit of imagery. Suffice to say food allergies have come up during our many games of “would you rather.” In fact, one which has come up several times has been “would you rather be lactose intolerant or _______?” Past fill-ins have included “have a nut allergy” and “drink drip coffee every morning” and “go vegan.” They’ve always – and I mean always – won. To not have dairy seems, well, intolerable. I’m beginning to rethink such an aversion to lactose intolerance. For if there were ever a time in which I wish my body would out and out reject cheese it would be right now. Actually, strike that; it would have been prior to last Thursday, the day in which I started Taylor Jenkins Reid’s disastrous new book, Malibu Rising.And yet calling Jenkins Reid’s latest “cheesy” would be a disservice to cheese – that is unless we’re referencing the kind that is moldy and pungent. For Malibu Rising, in a word, stinks. On every level. More so than anything I’ve read this year, and by a country mile. Whether or not a country mile is any longer than a city one is immaterial; this is one contest in which the gap will not be closed. To be fair, I did not go into my reading with the highest of expectations. It feels odd even admitting this given how much I adored Jenkins Reid’s previous novel, Daisy Jones and the Six. That said, Daisy was not a work that blew my mind because of its prose or meter; I took to it so fondly because of its effortless fun. If anything, I anticipated at least a little bit of that with Malibu Rising. Nope. Not only is Malibu Rising not terribly fun, it’s pretty much terrible in general. Don’t mistake this for the viewpoint of the literary snob I tend to be, for I do enjoy my fair share of “light” and/or “beach” reads. And after a very recent exhausting reading experience, I was looking forward to something mindless, something entertaining, something fun. That isn’t too much to ask for, right? Wrong. Because even the fun documented within Malibu Rising felt ludicrous if not contrived. It was as if the writer googled 80’s cliches – and 50’s cliches, for that matter – and created her own checklist to develop her narrative. Better (or worse) still, Jenkins Reid’s characters were as stereotypical as Aunt Jemima’s image and likeness; I didn’t believe in a single one of them. And then there’s the dialogue. The aforementioned lactose intolerance I’d all but wished for? This was why. Conversations lacked anything of substance let alone authenticity, every word spoken or exchanged felt rife with cliché catchphrases and fortune cookie philosophy disguised as encouragement. I haven’t enough fingers and toes combined to count the amount of times I exclaimed “AYFKM with this?” 700+ words into this diatribe and I’ve yet to get to the actual story of Malibu Rising and the characters which guide it along. It opens very matter-of-factly, announcing a fire at Nina Riva’s Malibu mansion in August of 1983 (after a rather bloviated intro about Californian wildfires). Nina, a world-renown model (of course), is the eldest of the famous Riva children; her brother, Jay, is a world-renown surfer (of course); her other brother but from another mother (more on that to come), Hud, is a world-renown photographer (of course); youngest sibling, Kit, isn’t world-renown but should be, she being a better surfer than her big bro because how can she not have a remarkable talent when in this family? It’s easy to understand why once we learn about their dear old dad, the world-renown singer (of course) Mick Riva. A man as famous for his philandering as for his singing, Jenkins Reid paints Mick as a formulaic deadbeat dad – so much so he leaves their mom, June, not once but twice! – who gets by on his good looks and swarthy charm. Through flashback we learn of he and June’s impetus, how he’d found her on the beach one day and called her the “prettiest one” there, how he told her he was going to be a big star and get her a big house with two sinks. What he didn’t tell her was that he would step out on her and the family they’d build so often it would drive June to drink. A lot. That Mick wouldn’t send child support only led June to the bottle more and more. And when her kids started to notice? The brunt of parenthood would be left to eldest child Nina to shoulder. Thankfully the one thing Mick did leave them was his surname, something which held plenty of weight in a celebrity town like Malibu. It’s that name which gets the kids through life. Good looks and otherworldly talent, too. It’s also that name which transforms what started as a small annual kegger into THE RIVA PARTY!, the last of which plays the main setting of Malibu Rising. Jenkins Reid splits her novel into two sections – the 12 hours leading up to the party (plus plenty of 50’s-era background), and the 12 during and after it – in call and response fashion, setting up the Riva family’s many problems in the former and attempting to tidily solve them in the latter, all the while painting the most ludicrous party scene in pop culture save for This is The End. And while that may have been a movie, it was a satirical one; I’m guessing there isn’t an ounce of satire anywhere throughout Malibu Rising. Sincerity, either, for even its abundance of sweetness felt fake; each sentiment expressed came across as nothing more than saccharine-filled faux-earnestness. Suffice to say it could have used heaping doses of both. What Malibu Rising lacked most of all was engagement. Never once did it click with me, nor provide me any desire to engross myself within its offerings. It would have helped to have an author who doesn’t appear to be completely checked out and still riding on the coattails of her previous work. It’s as if Taylor Jenkins Reid were borrowing a page from Mick Riva himself, getting by simply on name and past work. Well, I sure as shit fell for it. But only for a second. For I knew Malibu Rising wasn’t for me practically from page one. I’d hoped it would improve or at the very least entertain; it did neither. I didn’t expect to have my mind blown but at the same time didn’t anticipate a dumpster fire in return. And yet the whole fire narrative was spelled out for me from the beginning. SILLY ME. I imagine many will think I am being too hard on Taylor Jenkins Reid and on Malibu Rising. And perhaps I am. I read for escapism just as much as anyone else; that said I want to be taken to a place that feels real yet provides the entertainment value the monotony of life so often lacks. With Malibu Rising, the monotony of the Riva family’s lives are what was supposed to provide the entertainment value and yet offered nothing more than a desire for intolerance. Which is why the next time my wife and I play “would you rather” I plan to offer “would you rather read Malibu Rising again or ________? I can already tell you that whatever fills in the blank will win. Handily."

◇ The Plot:
 Malibu Rising is the story of fire. Of destruction. And renewal, rising from the Ashes.27 August, 1983. It began at the home of Nina Riva—during one of the most notorious parties in Los Angeles history.The annual party grew wildly out of control sometime around midnight.By 7:00 a.m., the coastline of Malibu was engulfed in flames.Because, just as it is in Malibu’s nature to burn, so was it in one particular person’s nature to set fire and walk away.☆☆Taylor Jerkin Raids definitely knows how to make me sob. I cried, I am the crybaby of this buddy read. Don't judge, okay?? 

“Family is found...whether it be blood or circumstance or choice, what binds us does not matter. All that matters is that we are bound.”“But a good life is knowing people care about you, knowing you can take care of the people that count on you.”

Malibu Rising was an amazing and fantastic read for me. I'm literally in lack of words. Seriously don't know how to sort out my feelings. I'm shaken to the core and emotions are literally scattered everywhere around me. I really enjoyed this book. But at the same time, I am bound to say that it is nothing special. The book made me cry but couldn't captivate my heart like I expected it to do.The most interesting parts of this book are the siblings bonding featured here. The Riva siblings are truly mind blowing. I loved their bonding and loyalty. They never told each other, I love you. But their actions spoke for them. My stone-made heart just melted seeing their honest relationships. Specially when they surf together, I promise it is a fabulous scenery to witness. 
“That is the thing about the water, it is not yours to control. You are at the mercy of nature. That’s what makes surfing feel like more than sport: It requires destiny to be on your side, the ocean must favor you.
Now, let's talk about Nina. No, let's just praise her. Really!!! I have nothing but a bunch of praises and heart-felt respect for her. She was the mother and the father, her siblings never had. Nina was only a child when she took the burden of raising her three siblings on her tiny shoulders. She dropped out of high school, she worked and took care of her brother and sisters. When her friend said to Nina, ""You haven't lived a single day of your life - for yourself..."" it truly broke my heart. Nina is amazing. I loveeeddd her. She handled every situation, both good and bad, way better than her parents did. 
“She knew it was up to her to say what had to be said. To do what had to be done. When there is only you, you do not get to choose which jobs you want, you do not get to decide you are incapable of anything. There is no room for distaste or weakness. You must do it all. All of the ugliness, the sadness, the things most people can't stand to even think about, all must live inside of you. You must be capable of everything.”
I actually loved all the Riva kids, Nina, Jay, Hud, Kit and (probably a Riva) Casey. Oops, sorry. I didn't love Hud. I didn't like him at all. I don't have the luxury to forgive a liar and a cheater, let alone like his character. Hud and Ashley, don't care. And Mick Riva...you can straight up go to hell. Same goes to Brandon. They were a awful lot of liars and cheaters. GO TO HELL you all."
2436,3.0,"I love a good family drama but this one left me feeling disappointed in the end. Told in two distinctly different ways, we learn of the love story between June and Mick Riva. A crooner who sweeps her off her feet only to marry and leave her twice. His fame and the groupies completely takeover any interest in his marriage and family. June struggles to raise four children (one was abandoned by a groupie, the result of a one night stand) and operating a family restaurant that is more often in the red than making a buck. Leaving the oldest daughter to raise her siblings. The stress gets to June and soon, the entire family is relying on the oldest.The second part of the story is focused on one evening of an annual party thrown by the family (children who are now adults), which becomes a fictional who's who. The situation becomes out of control as the drug of choice back in the 1980's (when this party takes place) spurs outrageous actions from threesomes to swinging on chandeliers. One brother fixates on having seen ""Goldie"" at a previous party, while other sports stars, local tv anchors and television and movie stars show up for some fun. I found it so implausible and dull (I'm sorry regular movie stars barely interest me) so fictional ones aren't exciting to me either.While a fire is mentioned as the hook, it wasn't what I had expected. I did like how Reid points to renewal and new beginnings by the cleansing a fire brings.Jenkins Reid writes very well and her prose is fluid, at the end of the day, I felt it was a nothing burger. I love the review posted by Denise captioned, ""Riding the Wave to Minority Island"". Denise and I agree on our takeaways, and her review nailed my thoughts as well so beautifully."

Regaladme algunas de vuestras estrellas que las necesito aquí o cómo convertir una historia que, a priori, parece simple en algo que no puedas olvidar. La autora lo ha vuelto a hacer. Una vez más me he llegado a preguntar si era un libro o una biografía. Ha vuelto a crear unos personajes magníficos y realmente creíbles que salen del libro para meterse en tu corazón. Incluso, en un momento dado, tuve que soltar el libro para buscar vídeos de surf.Un libro con una estructura cuidadada y efectiva aderezado con un montón de sentimientos y emociones mezclados de manera maravillosa. El final me ha encantado, nada de cursilerías solo ""justicia divina"". Realmente esto que voy a decir no tiene nada que ver con esta historia, pero si tuviera que decir algo ""negativo"" sería que hay ciertas reminiscencias comunes en las últimas historias de la autora en cuanto a fama, dinero, adicciones... Esto se me pasó por la cabeza al principio de la historia, luego sinceramente ni me volví a acordar.❝Pero justo entonces, comprendió que su trabajo no consistía en cargar con la caja entera. Su trabajo consistía en clasificar lo que había dentro. Decidir qué guardar y qué dejar atrás. Tenía que elegir qué parte de lo que había heredado de sus predecesores quería cargar de ahora en adelante. Y qué partes del pasado quería dejar atrás.❞"

Es esa clase de historia que no puedes soltar, que necesitas seguir descubriendo poco a poco, que te enfada, te rompe el corazón y te lo reconstruye.El final también me ha encantado, realista y justo, realmente creo que es lo que se merecía toda la historia.En definitiva, es un libro que, por supuesto, os recomiendo muchísimo y, si todavía no habéis leído a la autora, tenéis que hacerlo ya!!"
2439,5.0,"Is there anyone here NOT obsessed with Taylor Jenkins Reid? That is very clearly a rhetorical question, because, if you're not... well we need to talk. I've loved every one of TJR's books and Malibu Rising was no exception. If you've read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, you'll love the nods to some old characters - this book centers around the Riva family (as in Mick Riva, one of Evelyn's seven husbands) and has alternating timelines between Mick's marriage (not to Evelyn) as well as present day life of his four children. I couldn't put this one down from the moment I picked it up. Thank you to Random House for an advanced copy. All opinions are my own."
2440,3.0,"I’ve been wanting to read a Taylor Jenkins Reid book for a while now and actually have several of her previous works on my shelf, it’s just that I haven’t had time to get to them yet (which I intend to at some point) -- so of course, I was excited when I was able to get my hands on an ARC of Reid’s newest novel 
Malibu Rising
 (which is scheduled to release on June 1st). Reading the premise of the book, I originally thought this would be right up my alley, with a story revolving around the evolution of a family over several generations (I love family stories) against the backdrop of a setting (Southern California) and timeframe (1980s era) that I’m more than familiar with having myself grown up in Los Angeles in the 1980s. Based on these reasons, I thought I would be able to connect with the story at least somewhat – unfortunately, that did not turn out to be the case. Before I go into what didn’t work for me though, I do have to say that I actually didn’t have much issue with the writing. In fact, given the unique structure of the story, the descriptive language, the vivid imagery, as well as the use of allusion and foreshadowing woven so seamlessly throughout the narrative, I have no doubt in Reid’s abilities as a writer and a gifted storyteller. For me, the problems I had with this book had more to do with it perhaps being not the right book for me, and also going into this with certain expectations and being disappointed by the outcome.In terms of the story, the first half of this book was actually pretty solid (even though, admittedly, I couldn’t stand a few of the characters – but more on that later) and if the trajectory of the rest of the book had continued on in a similar vein, I’m sure this would’ve been a solid 4+ star read for me. But instead, the second half of the book — which started with the first hour of the party and covered the entire timeframe though to the end — unraveled to the point that I almost didn’t want to bother finishing the book, except that I was already so close to the ending and didn’t want to feel like I had wasted my time reading up to that point. Ironically, in the end, even after finishing the entire book, I still felt like I wasted my time because most of the Riva family’s story arc (which had been so well developed in the first half and I had been looking forward to in the second half) got lost in the shuffle of the wild and crazy, over-the-top play-by-play of the party (which I honestly felt was wasted plot space and highly unnecessary). I mean, yes, I knew from the beginning that the party would be an important part of the plot and I was expecting a few pages, perhaps even a few chapters, to be dedicated to the party — what I wasn’t expecting was for nearly every aspect of the party to be painstakingly detailed and drawn out over the course of 150+ pages. (Disclaimer: I didn’t actually count the pages, but part 2 started around the 53% mark on my Kindle and with the book clocking in at 384 pages, I figured 150 is a close enough midway page count). I’m sorry, but there is only so much of “the rich and famous behaving badly” that I am able to stomach (especially when that “behavior” consists of getting drunk, having sex, doing drugs, destroying things, etc., then rinse and repeat on overdrive every 2 pages or so) before I feel like I want to vomit. Given how the party concluded in the end, I honestly wasn’t sure what the point of including all those scenes was.As for the characters, I honestly didn’t like any of them (especially the parents, whose horrible decisions caused so much unnecessary pain and difficulty in their children’s lives). Probably the only character that I felt a little bit of sympathy for was Nina…everyone else was downright annoying, frustrating, and, in the case of Mick Riva, a disgusting piece of trash! The second half of the book consisted of a ridiculous parade of characters that I found exhausting to read about — after awhile, I just ended up skipping pages because I figured I wasn’t missing anything anyway…Obviously, I didn’t enjoy this book much and under normal circumstances, would’ve probably rated this way lower than I did — but I thought the first part was truly well done and the second part would’ve worked if not for the overload of irrelevant party scenes that overshadowed the main story line. Instead of being the powerful, moving story about love, loss, the bonds of family, resilience in the face of sacrifice, etc., that it could’ve (should’ve) been, this turned into a frustrating-to-read story about a rich and famous family whining about their messed up lives and their messed up relationships — a family that, by the end of the book, I could no longer bring myself to care about.Received ARC from Ballantine Books via NetGalley."
2441,4.0,"I have read six books by Taylor Jenkins Reid and they have received either five, four, three or two stars ... so, varying degrees of enjoyment and appreciation for her books, from me. The hopes were a little high for this one as it is sort of deemed as a ""family saga"" and I do love a good old family saga, a tale that spans decades and follows the live of parents, siblings, friends etc. I did enjoy it but it didn't hit the ""high/high"" note of The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, which was an absolute favourite read of mine.But, overall, a good, but not a brilliant read for me. The ending might have fallen a little flat and I think I would have preferred more closure and follow up ... 
“Maybe our parents' lives are imprinted within us, maybe the only fate there is is the temptation of reliving their mistakes. Maybe, try as we might, we will never be able to outrun the blood that runs through our veins. Or. Or maybe we are free the moment we are born. Maybe everything we've even done is by our own hands.”

“That is the thing about the water, it is not yours to control. You are at the mercy of nature. That’s what makes surfing feel like more than sport: It requires destiny to be on your side, the ocean must favor you.”

 ... there was a big difference between what you needed to believe and what you actually believed.

This night ... was not going to end well.
 FYI, the following image is surfing in the West of Ireland ... we can compete with Malibu any time!! (not really but gotta plug it - we probably won't have the sunshine but we will have the waves ...)"
2442,3.0,"“There were models crying in the corners and rock stars smoking weed on the stairs. There were writers fighting in the dining room and pop stars having sex in the bathrooms and studio execs passed out on the sofas. There were surfers puking on the lawn. Actors throwing wine glasses like footballs. TV stars putting on Nina‘s clothes and pocketing her jewelry. One of the kids from Family Ties was lying in the middle of the fallen chandelier singing Heart of Glass and staring up at the hole left in the ceiling.”In 1983, the four adult Riva siblings throw a drug-fueled party full of lovers, ex-lovers and various shallow strangers. Soap opera quality conflicts arise - cheating, secret relatives, unrevealed pregnancy, fist fights, literally swinging from a chandelier. Not one but two men show up begging to be forgiven and taken back. This is a trashy book. I am really surprised that I finished it because that is not my style at all. The only part I liked was when the siblings were children and first taught themselves to surf and then had to deal with their alcoholic mother and absent father, famous singer Mick Riva. Unfortunately, that part was very brief. The rest was a cheesy compilation of “how I met/lost my love”. Then, when the last surprise guest showed up at the party, it was just laughable. Seriously saccharine ending. 2.5 starsI received a free copy of this book from the publisher. "

2445,2.0,"2 1/2 Stars There was a great book hidden inside Malibu Rising, written by a talented author, whose previous books I really enjoyed.It opens with a detailed history of the fires that have plagued Malibu, California over the years. It then ominously reveals that the coastline of Malibu would be engulfed in flames the morning after a notorious and out of control party; The Malibu Fire of 1983. As I got to know the characters, that thought lingered in my mind throughout the entire book. Will they get out in time, will someone get injured, or would anyone even survive? The first half of the book is split between two timelines, the days leading up to Nina's party in 1983 and flashing back to 1956 when her parents met...and the laborious saga that ensues. I know I'm in the minority with this book, but the whole beginning just seemed to drag on and on and the excessive flashbacks were just too much for me.I may have been more enamored with books about the rich and famous while I was in my 20s, but for the most part, I just don’t care to read about them now. This felt very Jackie Collins esque, (no offense to her), meets Baywatch. I didn't want to read about the constant lying, womanizing, selfishness of the “famous “father”, and I use that term loosely; philandering !@$!!*!, who abandoned his wife and kids multiple times. Yes, I realize there probably wouldn't be a story without it, but so be it.Although there were some atmospheric descriptions of the 1980s and Malibu, I felt it could be more fleshed out. Being I grew up around that time, I got the references but just wanted to be more immersed. I did enjoy the descriptions and lingo about surfing and how it interweaves between the close knit brothers and sisters.I love a well done family drama with deep explorations into the familial ties, but this was more over the top soap opera than fiction. The fame and groupie lifestyle of the father, who just “couldn't help” sleeping with every single attractive woman or girl, while married, just made me angry, especially while leaving a wife, who he loves so much “but can't help himself”, and four children, with no emotional or financial support whatsoever, despite his fame and fortune.The second part of the book, on the day of “the notorious over the top” party, reads like an outrageous, hedonistic satire, obviously delving into the shallow, sex and drug riddled side of Hollywood. Yes, there were literally people swinging from the chandeliers, yes, there were blow by blow descriptions, pun intended, of blow jobs and sex among the famous and not so famous attendees, yes there were threesomes. No, I didn't enjoy reading about it.Add to that, the narrator seems to fixate on numerous party attendees, random, miscellaneous side-characters, and go into tremendous background details, which to me, was unnecessary and added nothing to the story. The ominous fire and the over the top party had such build ups, but fell flat for me.What I did like about the book and what stopped me from dnf, was the very strong and protective relationships between the four siblings. The bond they shared despite having to endure many extreme hardships, was unbreakable and inspiring. Stripping away all the minutiae and excess, there is a novel about the intricacies of what it means to be a parent, a sibling, and family in general.I did laugh a few times as well as shed a few tears (not unusual for me) at the end, but overall, just not the most enjoyable reading experience for me. I'm glad so many others loved it!Even though this was mostly a miss for me, I really enjoyed Forever, Interrupted,  One True Loves and Maybe in Another Life, and gave them each 4 stars. So, I'll still definitely check out other books by Taylor Jenkins Reid."
2446,5.0,i don't care about rich white people unless they're written by taylor jenkins reid
2447,3.0,"3.5 stars!For me, Malibu Rising is one of those books that needs Goodreads to introduce 1/2 stars.I did the audiobook for this and Julia Whelan did a fantastic job of narrating the book!I thought the story of the Riva family, and the past timeline of how June & Mick meet in the 1950s was well done.In fact, I loved the storyline of that and how the Riva children; Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit all survive with the dysfunctional family dynamics.But Malibu Rising didn’t have the same sort flow or heart for me like Daisy Jones & The Six did.It felt like two different books and I think the raging party at the end pulled the focus away from the family. It lost a bit of heart at the end in my opinion.I enjoyed the party atmosphere that’s set in 1983 in Malibu.I really liked the setting of the 1980s in Malibu, California for this book. It's very nostalgic for me!- I loved the whole surf vibe.- I loved the mention of the Vans slip on shoes.- Cocaine binging at parties on a serving tray.- And those damn yuppies in their polo shirts, khaki slacks and knitted sweaters used as an accessory.I just didn’t enjoy the two together.And in fact, I just couldn’t see the Riva kids being in this type of environment.They seemed more solid and low key to deal with all the wankers at the party.I had to suspend some disbelief on the two things:Riva family and raging party in Malibu being connected.I think I’m likely in the minority on this new Taylor Jenkins Reid book.I know others have loved this more.But for me, I thought Malibu Rising was good, just not great."
2448,5.0,"this book is like if shameless had a child with gossip girl. if it wasn't clear before, it's certainly clear now: tjr can do no wrong. the writing was absolutely stunning and although the story was episodic, the characters had so much depth and i quickly got attached to all of them. (nina and jay were my babies.)this entire story was my cup of tea. i love a good family dynamic, especially ones with strong female leads, so this ticked all the boxes for me. the characters were complex, all woven together in covert ways and they had so much development in such little time.overall, it completely blew me out of the water and is easily one of my favorite books ever written. massive thank you to taylor jenkins reid for making this year a little better. ➳ 5 stars."
2449,5.0,"I adored this book. Taylor Jenkins Reid’s writing is just incredible, her characters feel so real! I loved the setting and how the first part of the book flipped between time frames, it was a really engaging way of being told the characters’ backstory and how they got to where they were. Once the party started I could not put the book down. The constant cliffhangers and change of focus made for a really engaging story. I 100% recommend this book to everyone, especially if you loved Evelyn Hugo; it’s a different vibe but seeing the subtle references to Evelyn and Celia made me really happy!"

2452,4.0,"I don't need to take a peek at a best seller list to know Malibu Rising is one of the hottest titles this summer. And a big reason for the success is many readers have fallen in love over the years with Taylor Jenkins Reid's writing style. One of my most anticipated reads this year for sure. I liked the plot of this book but found myself emotionally detached from the characters. And that’s kinda weird because usually TJR’s books are just bursting with heart. Essentially this story is a family drama. It follows the lives of the various Riva family members and has flashbacks to key moments. In the ""present day"" it is 1983 and model and surfer, Nina Riva, is having her annual summer party at her Malibu home. In attendance will be her younger siblings; Jay, Hud, and Kit. They are all the offspring of famous singer, Mick Riva. The party will get so out of control the mansion will catch on fire. Hmm.. how did that happen?The story was entertaining but I kept waiting to feel emotionally invested in the characters. I just never really clicked with them on anything more than a surface level. I was interested in their lives but I certainly wasn't going to shed a tear if their heart was broken. I had a similar reading experience with TJR's last novel, Daisy Jones & The Six. It wasn't until the last quarter or so of that book when things started to come together and I fell in love. I kept waiting for it to occur here and it was disappointing when it didn't happen for me.With that being said, even though I wouldn't place this book in the special or memorable category, I'd still recommend reading it if you are a fan of the author."
2453,4.0,"Taylor Jenkins Reid has done it again, creating an engaging story filled with memorable characters that you can’t help but want to learn more about.I loved how this book explored the saga of this dysfunctional family as the Riva children’s parents Mick and June began their relationship in the 50s, the kids grew up in the 60s, up to the 80s when the legendary party takes place. Overall, I found the shifts between the past and the day of the party to be well done and not interrupt the flow of the story. This dual timeline approach also allowed for an exploration of themes such as overcoming a difficult home life, and whether we’re able to break free from the cycle of repeating the mistakes of our parents. Though the book started out a bit slow, I enjoyed learning the backstories of the Riva children, which helped give context and depth to some of the events of the fateful party. The main characters felt complex and well-developed, with the perfect mixture of negative character traits to make them feel realistic.Once we began focusing more exclusively on the party in later chapters, I did feel like the novel began to feel a bit more surface-level. There were so many storylines going on that—while very entertaining—did detract a bit from the exploration of family dynamics that we had worked so hard to develop. Despite all the wild shenanigans that went on, I didn’t feel as immersed in the world as I did in the early chapters of the book, as the amount of side characters being introduced and focused on felt more like a distraction than a development. But I will say the party portions were compulsively readable. Thank you to Ballantine Books and NetGalley for the eARC in exchange for an honest review."
2454,2.0,"Is this actually the same author who wrote Evelyn Hugo? 😭 I’ve read this book 4 days ago and the more I think about it, the more I want to give it 1 star, but the writing was amazing and I loved Nina, so 2 stars it is.In part one we meet the Rivas children while they are planning their infamous “Riva party”. We also get their backstory on their parents and childhood, which was dramatic and sad thanks to their piece of shit of a father.This part was good, I felt like I was gossiping with a friend about some celibrities and their hardships, but nothing more.But then, I got to the second part where the party occurs and I wanted to cry with how downhill it went. I trusted the author thinking it will give me a more in-depth connection to the characters, some kind of rebirth for all the family and plot twists. None of that happened.Instead I got:- 20 POVs of narcissistic and entitled people irrelevant to the story and made it drag- 0 character development except for Nina at the very end- A man bringing 2 bricks of coke to the party and people believing they are in Sia’s music video swinging from chandeliers- A suposed “climax” that was a total let downOverall, a disappointment.🥰Thanks to this author for making me go on a book slump, now I can focus on work. So considerate of her🥰"
2455,4.0,"ko-fi | blog1983. Malibu. 4 siblings. 1 party that changes everything. Malibu Rising is the kind of story that's hard to forget, even though you didn't think you'd like it and were quite bored halfway through. The characters were so real they almost jumped off the page, and I was rooting for them till the end. I loved this story. I wasn't sure what I was feeling in the beginning, and I wasn't sure where it would take me, but I was not disappointed. This is a story about four siblings and the night that changes their lives. It's a story about choosing what to share with your family, and what to leave behind. It's a story about love, family, grief, and most importantly, forgiveness, and if there is even room for that in our lives. Taylor Jenkins Reid can write about human emotion like know else. She can tell a story like no one else. I can't wait to see what she crafts next.---currently-readingThis is set in the same world as The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo!!

This was everything!I'm glad that Taylor Jenkins Reid's newest book did not disappoint. I was worried since her previous two novels have gained incredible praise and this one was getting really good early praise as well. But I'm glad to say that I loved this! Not quite as much as Evelyn Hugo though, but still a fantastic novel!I was surprised at how emotional this one was for me. For some reason I was not expecting a family drama at all, but was pleasantly surprised! I really enjoyed the flashbacks to the beginning of the Riva family, and following them as they grow up. I thought that the addition of those scenes really made the characters come alive.Speaking of characters, Reid is a master-wizard when it comes to creating incredibly real characters. Although a lot of the characters are famous, Reid manages to still encase them in reality and make them have real life struggles that they have to push through. I gotta say that Nina Riva stole my heart in this one. Definitely one of Reid's best characters in my opinion. All of the sibling's dynamics with each other really brought a tear to my eye. I also love how these characters act within their own unique judgements. They're flawed and they're supposed to not make the best decisions and that what I absolutely loved about them! The plot was also really well paced. I enjoyed the juxtaposition of going back in time via flashbacks, and then coming back to the main storyline. The latter half of this book was a whirlwind of emotions! so many things happen that I just couldn't put this book down! My only real gripe with this story is that it wraps up pretty quickly. I feel like this could've easily been another 50 pages longer and it would've given us better closure. It was just a bit rushed for my liking.The audiobook, narrated by Julia Whelon, is exceptional! She does such a great job at giving each character their own voices and truly gives an amazing performance!This book is like the perfect summer read. If you're looking for a new release for the summer season, look no further! I want to try Reid's lesser known novels now. If you've read any of them, let me know which ones are worth it!"
2459,5.0,I love Taylor Jenkins Reid so much her writing style is addictive & so beautiful. This story held my attention as it is set over the course of 24 hours and you knew something was going to go wrong but just when was the question. My favourite part was the link to the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo & Daisy Jones it made my heart happy.
2460,3.0,"A frothy, fun 3.5 Stars This book is the quintessential beach read. Soapy and sometimes cheesy but I enjoyed it. Sometimes a book doesn’t have to change your life or stay with you long after you finish it. Sometimes a book is just a breezy way to pass some time. So yeah, I enjoyed it, the narrative flowed easily which made it a quick read. I think I’m destined to enjoy all TJR’s books to different degrees because I really love her writing style. She’s become one of my favorite authors this year and I’ll read anything she writes and look forward to new books with anticipation. This wasn’t my favorite of hers but fun nonetheless. Now what I loved about this book was the relationship of the Riva kids, Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit. Their bond felt authentic and it’s what made this book so enjoyable to me. I liked learning about each of them apart and together. I also enjoyed the back story of scoundrel Mick Riva and syrupy June their parents. I felt most of the back story snippets of the party guests weren’t needed. Sorry Ted and chick who’s name I forgot, I kinda don’t care what happens to you. Shoo, go eat a clam. I also loved the setting in Malibu, I was easily transported to the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) with miles of beach on one side and thirsty dry hills on the other. Arguably (or not) one of the most beautiful beaches in the world. All in all a fun beach read. "
2461,5.0,"Me encantan el mar, el surf, los 80, las novelas con historias de familia, Los Ángeles y los personajes imperfectos. Pero, por encima de todo, me gusta Taylor Jenkins Reid. Así que esto era una apuesta segura y, efectivamente, Taylor demuestra que sabe lo que hace incluso cuando se aleja de la temática romántica y nos muestra las fortalezas y debilidades de una familia inolvidable. La ambientación, 10. (Solo le pondría un pero a la edición española, con demasiadas erratas, pero eso no es culpa de la autora, obviamente)."
2462,4.0,"Amazing characters, great storytelling, and very immersive book in general. But much like all of TJR’s books that I have read so far, the plot is hard to find.

“Just because it is in Malibu's nature to burn, so was it in one particular person's nature to set fire and walk away.”
 Malibu Rising was AMAZING! I LOVED it. It was so so entertaining, and I couldn't put it down. This was my first novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid, and it definitely won't be the last. Taking on a unique perspective about the dramatic lives of American celebrities, this book had me completely invested and charmed. The writing was just so addictive AGH chef's kiss Side note: I'm so so jetlagged writing this review, so it won't make a whole lot of sense - my apologies 🤩🥴
The Characters
- Nina is such a wholesome person; I loved her so so much. She works so hard for her brothers and sisters(view spoiler)[ and I'm so glad she got a happy ending 💖 (hide spoiler)].
“Accept accept accept. For so long, Nina had believed it was her greatest strength—that she could withstand, that she could endure, that she would accept it all and keep going. It was so foreign to her, the idea of declaring that something was unacceptable.”
 At the beginning of the novel, Nina is getting over the very public fallout with her pro tennis husband. I think she might be my favorite Riva because she's so kind and empathetic. But she's not naive; she's a realist, but she cares, too much, about making sure other people are happy, which means she leaves little time for herself.
“Nina understood, maybe for the first time, that letting people love you and care for you is part of how you love and care for them.”
 I wanted so badly to just hug her and tell her to prioritize her self. Her selfless character interested me a lot. Often, fictional celebrities are written off as snobby and self-obsessed, so Nina Riva's totally selfless and altruistic personality took me by surprise. Going into this, I was worried this might be about a bunch of assholes related to other assholes who are assholes to each other. But I really liked where the writer took this.  - Jay annoyed me sometimes, but I liked his character arc. Aaaaand he added good conflict heheh
Assholes protect their own. They are faithful to no one but surprisingly protective of each other.
 (view spoiler)[I feel like he was being butthurt about Hud and Ashley FOR NO REASON. He didn't even like her that much and moving on to other girls. He's just used to being the center of attention, and the idea of Hud having something he can't makes him upset 😟 (hide spoiler)] He was definitely my least favorite Riva, but I think he was important for plot progression !! - Hud's side story wasn't as interesting as the other siblings, but I loved his backstory. (view spoiler)[Reid did such an amazing job distinguishing him from the other siblings and showing in subtle ways how he felt like an outsider. (hide spoiler)]
Jay’s and Hud’s passion, their livelihood, their lives, depended on chasing the ever-changing, unpredictable combination of wind and water.
 He seemed like, although he made mistakes, he had good intentions and, more than anything, didn't want to hurt his brother. He has a good heart ❤️- Another thing I really liked is that we, as the reader, get to see Kit discover herself and help find peace for her family. (view spoiler)[also I loved how she had that moment of realization when she was kissing Ricky; it was very well-written (hide spoiler)]
The Writing
The character development is IMMACULATE. It's so well done. I loved how Reid would focus on some random character for a chapter or two to add a whole 'nother level of depth. LOVE IT.One of the only things that kept me from absolutely loving this book is that it was pretty chaotic. It felt like, especially during the party, there were a million things going on and so much to keep track of in my mind. Like I said before, I loved the idea of adding stories of the minor characters, but it was a little bit overdone in my opinion. Some characters I just did not care about. 😐In conclusion, I loved this, but it's not an all-time favorite or 5/5 read. It's a solid 4/5 for me, but I highly recommend, especially during the summer (it's a great beach read!!).Anyways, I'm going to bed because I'm tired and not sure I'm making sense but I wanted to put this review out there and its out now so goodnight everyone"

“Family is found...whether it be blood or circumstance or choice, what binds us does not matter. All that matters is that we are bound.”
You can read a more detailed review on my blog.I believe it is impossible to not cry while reading a Taylor Jenkins Reid book. It simply isn't. Every book of hers that I read I forget that I am not reading about real people. They are merely fictional characters, but that leaves me asking how Jenkins Reid can write such realistically broken people.This book was so many things at once: a tale about love, heartbreak, family, and hurt. It centres around the two generations of the Riva family and their struggles. From the synopsis (like other reviewers) I gathered that the second generation--Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit--were famous and they lived in the public eye, however, that is not the case. Their life is full of struggles, hardship, and love for each other. In the end, it was not what I was expecting, but I loved it nevertheless.Whenever I review Jenkins Reid's books, I always point out her ability to write realistic characters. Malibu Rising is no different. I fall quickly for fictional characters, but I fall even harder when it comes to her books, which leave me in tears. Every. Single. Time. The author's writing is something that I could get lost in. Another quirk of Jenkins Reid's books is that her characters make cameos in various books, so when you recognise a name, you scream, ""I know them!""Once again, 5 stars are just not enough~ 5 starsMy first thoughts:I was so close to not crying at yet the third book by the one and only Taylor Jenkins Reid. But no. I cried. Like a baby. I need time to write a review and stop these tears."
2468,5.0,"this book was so good ????i literally read it in one sitting (which, to be fair, i have done for every single one of taylor jenkins reid’s books, but it’s still valid) and i already wanted to reread it by the time i’d finished ahhhh"
2469,3.0,"2.5 starsMy college roommates during our senior year threw a large party in our house, at which there ended up being a lot of (too many) drunk and rowdy fraternity guys, with no respect for the fact we were living in a rented, newly constructed home for which we were counting on getting back 100% of our large deposit. As the night went on, the guys forgot there was new carpet beneath their feet as they threw beer at each other and dropped their cigarette butts on the floor to be snuffed out with their shoes. (Who raised these animals?) They forgot their manners when they threw each other into the walls and put their elbows through the drywall. I forgot mine too when I lost it and said they all needed to leave. It was one of the worst nights of my college days.This book, my fourth by TJR, took me back to that night. Just like I didn't care for those fraternity guys, I didn't give a fig about any of these characters. Absent, cheating husbands prevailed. Nina and her siblings had tremendous strengths, but her party at the end turned my stomach; and the author kept introducing new characters that I also did not care anything about. I listened to this, narrated by Julia Whelan who never fails to give a 5 star performance. Unfortunately it wasn't enough to help my rating."
2470,4.0,"“Because, just as it is in Malibu’s nature to burn, so was it in one particular person’s nature to set fire and walk away.” This is the kind of book that makes you want to learn a new sport, surfing in particular, even though you are as unbalanced as one can be, and are a bit terrified of the ocean. It makes you want to soak up all of the sunlight's warmth while you still can and hold it close. It even makes you appreciate your family a bit more, especially the older sisters. If you can't gather already, I really enjoyed this novel and Taylor Jenkins Reid is now officially one of my favourite authors.Malibu Rising takes place during 1983 in Malibu, and it follows the 4 Riva siblings and their family: Nina Riva (aka my wife), Jay Riva, Hudson Riva, and Kit Riva. We also get to read about the story of June Riva and Mick Riva, the legendary singer (and the 3rd husband of Evelyn Hugo, for those who read The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo). The first part of the story explains the family and characters through each of their perspectives while the second part of the story explains the infamous Riva party that ends up going in flames. TJR managed to effortlessly weave through the decades as she did in her previous novels, all while telling a story that takes place in 24 hours. The writing is magnificent, and not a single moment was dull. I also really appreciated the fact that the chapters were short. The setting was perfectly described and I'm sad that I chose to read this on a rainy day when I could've taken it with me to the beach on a sunny day. It honestly felt like I was transported to Malibu. As for the characters, I loved some more than others, especially Nina and June; hey'll always have a special place in my heart. I enjoyed the plot for the most part, mainly the parts with June and Mick; I will admit that I liked the first half of the story more then the second half. Additionally, there were TWO seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo references and that made me really happy. The few issues I did have with this book is that I found a few of the characters a bit two-dimensional, particularly the 3 Riva siblings other than Nina, and I also wasn't much of a fan of the unnecessary POV's in the second part of the story. I did find the particular 3 siblings interesting, I just wish there was more information about them and that their personalities were slightly more developed. Other than this, it was a great novel and would say it's a perfect read for the summer. 4/5 stars."
2471,1.0,"What the actual fuck did I just subject myself to? This.Was.Excruciating. I only kept trudging through the tedium because I was fueled by rage. And you know, a whole lot of disbelief.I have one question for you. Have you ever kissed anyone on the cheekbone? Not the cheek...the cheek BONE. Because I haven't and yet every damn character in this hot mess did exactly that. Repeatedly.""He leaned toward her and put his lips to the spot on her cheekbone that bumped right up to her eye. It was hard like bone and smooth like velvet.""Hard like bone, as bones tend to be. *facepalm*The writing was, well....look for yourself.""The far corner of the Jacuzzi was in the far corner of the pool, which was in the far corner of the lawn.""So, it was in the far corner then? Sweet gentle. ""He drank more of the whiskey and gagged at the sheer amount that was flowing down his throat.""""Fuuuuuuuck"" someone screamed from the crowd that had gathered. Others gasped as the blood started to trickle down. ""Oh my God,"" one of the women said over and over. ""Someone do something!""Yes, please. Someone. Anyone!!!I mean, come on, man. It's just lazy writing. BAD writing. And yet, it's going to be a tv series? Please someone help me understand why. How?? I didn't care about a single member of the Rivas. The second half of the book introduced random characters who behaved predictably over the top and had NO PLACE in the story line. They served as filler. Actually, the majority of the book was just that. Filler, filler and more fucking filler. And also, how does one recognize a familial connection by a person's bottom lip alone ??I can't even talk about this anymore.Taylor gets one star because she had ONE redeeming passage in this whole pointless exercise in frustration. ""As she pulled onto PCH, 'Hungry Heart' started playing through her speakers and Ashley felt the tiniest bit of hope. Your whole world can be falling apart, she thought, but then Springsteen will start playing on the radio.""You right, Taylor. But um, we're still breakin' up. Bye, girl."
2472,3.0,"3.5 starsThis was the June pick for House Salt Book ClubWhat a ride. While I could sit here and talk lots about the ways Evelyn Hugo, Daisy Jones and this are different/better/worse, I'm genuinely impressed by what TJR is creating in this series of related historical fiction/contemporary novels. Her contemporary world-building is second to none and she often creates such devastating characters. It's really a treat to read. In Malibu Rising, I thing we do see those TJR hallmarks. It's a vibrant world with characters whose circumstances, while certainly leagues from my own, still grabbed at my heart. That said, I do think that as a main character, Nina lacks a little something, particularly because I was expecting either an Evelyn or a Daisy. In my head, I understood Nina's characterization, and why she locks away her own personality and wants and wishes. For the reading experience, however, it creates kind of a void. I wished there were a stronger anchor for the story. I did really enjoy the supporting characters, however, even the ones I spent the whole book hating. My heart hurt plenty while reading, particularly in the flashback scenes. I think this book needed both the flashbacks and the present scenes at the party, but I felt that the two pieces of the story didn't come together well. It felt like two different stories and I wish we'd gotten the flashbacks woven in a little more effortlessly. I was expecting a TJR kind of ending for this and not only wasn't not quite that, but it was also a bit anticlimactic. For all the build of the party, it almost wrapped up too quickly. Nina's storyline in particular felt so rushed at the end that it didn't really feel like she got the benefit of a full arc. Overall, though, I gobbled this up and thought about it long after I finished. It's obvious that TJR could release 100 books in this world/series, and I'd read them all. "
2474,4.0,"Another excellent character-driven novel by Taylor Jenkins Reid. The book was an homage to the many faces of California, but above all else, to its ocean waves. I thought she did an amazing job inviting the reader into the Riva family and Nina was a unique protagonist. Once the party got underway, I felt a bit bombarded by characters, making the ending less satisfying for me than the beginning. It's a great choice for a summer read, especially if you're within sight or sound of a beach. "
2475,5.0,"TJR's writing in this was FANTASTIC! so descriptive and truly made me feel like i was a part of the Riva family and in Malibu. the plot wasn't my favorite of hers but overall, it had me gripped and wanting to read more! as of now, i think it's a 4.5ish star read for me! thank you to Ballantine for the gifted ARC. full review t come on my instagram @emilybookedup :)"

2477,4.0,Review to come. It did not disappoint.
2478,4.0,"4⭐️ iš 5⭐️ Taylor Jenkins Reid ir vėl nenuvylė! Nuo pirmo puslapio knyga taip įtraukė, kad minutes dienose gaudžiau, kad tik kokį puslapį kitą perskaityčiau. Lengva, vasariška, skanu, dramatiška, vietomis jautru, vietomis karšta. Reid yra mano mylimų rašytoj Jacqueline Susann ir Jackie Collins pasekėja ir tobulai rašo apie išoriškai glamūrinį, o viduje skauduliais ir priklausomybėmis išmargintą įžymybių ir turčių gyvenimą.Mikas Riva - didžiausia Amerikos roko žvaigždė. Jį dievina visi, išskyrus jo keturis pamestus vaikai. Nina, Džėjus, Hadas ir Kitė turėjo augti vieni, užsidirbti ir iš visų visutėliausių bėdų suktis patys. Vyriausios sesers Ninos, paaukojusios savo asmeninį gyvenimą, broliai ir seserys užaugo ir dabar savo laimę kuria patys. Nina tapo garsia banglentininke, modeliu, tačiau laimės tai neatnešė. Ją ką tik paliko vyras, o ir tviskantis gyvenimas Malibu pakrantėje nebedžiugina. Šiandien, jos namuose vyksta garsusis, kasmetinis Ninos Rivos vakarėlis, suburiantis garsiausius ir gražiausiu veidus. Tik jam įsibėgėjus ir pasirodžius nelauktiems svečiams, viskas taps nebe taip gražu.4⭐️ dėl to, kad man Daisy Jones & The six nepranoks niekas, atrodo. O šiaip - tobula vasaros knyga. Visko joje rasit: ir meilės, ir aistros, ir praeities skaudulių, ir glamūro, ir šmaikščių dialogų bei įsimintinų veikėjų. Siužetas keičiasi greit, kaip kokiam seriale (kurį, beje, pagal knygą jau kuria) ir niekad nežinai ko tikėtis. Nėra knyga visai saldi, tačiau ir ne egzistencines problemas svarsto. Didžiulis malonumas buvo šitais puslapiais lepintis."
2479,3.0,"Well.... here we are again in the minority with a Taylor Jenkins Reid book. TRJ'S latest two books.... Daisy Jones and the Six, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo... well I dnfed Seven Husbands and almost Dnfed Daisy Jones as well. (I know considering everyone had SUCH praise for these.)I think it's because I'm not a big movie star fan or rock and roll/music fan. This really just doesn't appeal to me at all in books. I also could really care less about the ""scene"" with famous people. I typically roll my eyes when people discuss it haha. So, on that note it doesn't fascinate me to read or hear about it in real life about people's wealthy lifestyles along with that music, fame, etc.So, unfortunately Malibu Rising fell into this same genre for me and fell extremely flat. It just had that same feel with following someone's lifestyle that's in the fame/movie awards etc.If you enjoy that Hollywood lifestyle or look into fame like her two previous books then this should be right up your alley! :)2.75/5 stars Thank you so much to Netgalley and Random House Ballantine for the arc in exchange for an honest review.Pub date: 6/1/21Published to GR: 2/20/21"
2480,4.0,"06/08/2021: i will say malibu rising isn’t on queen evelyn hugo’s level or daisy’s either, however this is still a great book.the back and forth timelines took a bit of getting used to at first because of how often it went to the past timeline. but i did find myself liking the past timeline more than the current one. something about seeing the tragic rise and fall of mick and june’s love story and being a parent really gripped me. tbh, if this story was based solely on them, i maybe would have giving this 5 stars. the second part was an absolute whirlwind. there was so much happening with the background characters. all i know is that this couldn’t be me, i would have lost it after seeing what was happening to my house and what people were doing in it. i loved that nina found her sense of agency to take control and stand up for herself. out of all the siblings maybe kit and nina were my faves, but the brothers, jay and hud, added to the dynamics and i appreciate them for it. ———Do I care about surf culture in Malibu? No. But you had me at 80s and Taylor Jenkins Reid."

""Destruction. And renewal, rising from the ashes. The story of fire.""

 Taylor Jenkins Reid explores family cycles while delivering an entertaining and emotional read. We have celebrities, lots of family drama, and the life lesson that we can set fire to our history and begin again. Read it.My favorite quote:“Maybe our parents' lives are imprinted within us, maybe the only fate there is is the temptation of reliving their mistakes. Maybe, try as we might, we will never be able to outrun the blood that runs through our veins. Or. Or maybe we are free the moment we are born. Maybe everything we've ever done is by our own hands.”"
2482,5.0,"Taylor Jenkins Reid's books always manages to captivate my attention completely and Malibu Rising was no different. Set in the 1980s Malibu, this was a glamorous portrayal of family drama featuring some excellent characters you can't help but get behind. I loved this and I could not put it down.This is very character driven and features a lot of POV's so if that is not something you typically enjoy then perhaps give this one a miss! "
2483,4.0,"*www.onewomansbbr.wordpress.com*www.facebook.com/onewomansbbrMalibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid. (2021). Malibu: August 1983. It's the day of Nina Riva's annual end-of-summer party and anticipation is at fever pitch. Everyone wants an invite to be with the Riva siblings: Nina the talented surfer/supermodel, Jay the championship surfer, Hud the renowned photographer and their adored baby sister Kit. The siblings are a source of fascination, especially as the children of legendary singer Mick Riva. By midnight the party will be completely out of control and by morning the mansion will be in flames. But ahead of that first spark, the alcohol will flow, music will play and the loves and secrets that shaped this family will all come bubbling to the surface. I was really excited to read this one after absolutely adoring the last two books by the author (Daisy Jones & The Six; The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo). I'm not going to lie, while I did really enjoy this one, it did not hit the same level of awesome for me that the other two did; but to be fair they are pretty hard books to beat! In this one we have four siblings who are known for their own talents as well as their famous, albeit estranged, father. I liked that we experienced all four siblings' perspectives. While the storyline focuses on the day/evening of Nina's party, it also delves into the history of their family which I really enjoyed and thought that was the strongest part of the story. There's a few interludes of random guests at the party where we experience their perspectives for a couple of pages; I didn't really think that was necessary myself. I did find this to be an entertaining and easy to read book - it's been described as the perfect beach read, I can say I read it over a couple of stormy winter days and can confirm that it would be a great read in any weather.Overall: I'd happily recommend this entertaining family domestic drama."
2484,4.0,"Demorei um tanto para começar a ler esse livro. Amo ""Os sete maridos de Evelyn Hugo"", mas ""Daisy Jones & The Six"" não funcionou comigo. Pensei que o mesmo pudesse acontecer aqui. Felizmente... não! Curti bastante essa leitura.""Malibu renasce"" é a história de uma família, contada em duas linhas do tempo: uma delas sendo a da icônica festa dos Riva, prestes a acontecer naquele mesmo dia; outra sendo a história de como Mick Riva conheceu June e todos os desafios que os filhos enfrentaram ao longo dos anos.A escrita de Taylor Jenkins Reid certamente se destacou para mim. A forma como ela consegue nos fazer entender o que cada personagem pensa, mesmo numa narração em terceira pessoa, é muito interessante. Acho que o tom da escrita em geral funcionou muito bem nesse livro.Cada irmão foi bem desenvolvido, e ver como eles se importavam uns com os outros foi bonito de acompanhar. Mick Riva é um canalha e partiu o coração ver as consequências da atitudes dele.Não acho que a sinopse faça jus ao livro: sabemos quais são os ""segredos explosivos"" antes de eles serem revelados na festa e o incêndio é só um detalhe. Assim que você se acostuma com o tom da narrativa, não é impossível prever o caminho que ela vai seguir. Isso não é necessariamente negativo, mas acho importante pontuar que é um livro de desenvolvimento de personagem, não tanto de enredo.Feliz em ter lido e animado para os próximos da autora!"
2485,4.0,"4.5 starsThis book was sooo much fun to read! As usual with his author, I got very attached to the characters and very fast. I loved how the POVs were constantly alternating between different characters. Surprisingly, I actually really enjoyed reading about so many characters; it allowed me to really get a sense of the Malibu lifestyle. I loved the build up that led to us finding out about what really happened to the Riva family. This book kept me awake till the early hours of the morning.BUT, as much as I loved the characters, the constant over-dramatic statements were really getting on my nerves.Overall, this was a fun read but not nearly as good as Daisy Jones and the Six and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo."
2486,5.0,I absolutely loved it! Teared up three times. I didn’t want it to end!! Honestly though in my opinion there should be one more chapter at the end. Also Kit needs her own book🙌🏻This will be the PERFECT book to read at the beach! (If you don’t live by the beach then listen to an ocean waves asmr!) Thank you so much NETGALLEY for allowing me to read this.
2487,4.0,Me declaro fan absoluta de esta autora. Me encantan las historias que arma. Lamentablemente en esta oportunidad la traducción es MALÍSIMA. Pero en eso la señora Taylor no tiene nada que ver.
2488,5.0,"5⭐️Taylor Jenkins Read offers only raw human emotion and happenings in Malibu Rising, and there was something so deafening in the way she does it. ""There's no room for you in my life anymore. And I don't owe it to you to make any space.""I think what was so interesting about this book, was that it offers the perspectives of those villainous characters - without excuses. This book is accountability and beginnings and selfishness and endings, with backstories and privilege and characters with this sort of unfathomable relatability.“June ended up in the exact place she had hoped Mick Riva would save her from.”My top read of 2021 so far - just read it ASAP."

2490,5.0,"Terminé el libro ayer y no he querido escribir mi reseña desde entonces, porque tenía que procesar qué tanto me había gustado el libro. Es bueno, realmente bueno y no creo que Taylor pueda escribir uno malo, la verdad, pero de ahí a saber cuánto me gustó era otra cosa.Los hermanos Riva han vivido cuidándose unos a otros toda su vida, pero aun así lograron salir adelante y cada uno forjarse un camino. En el presente estamos en el día de la mítica fiesta Riva, las preparaciones y las relaciones entre los hermanos, mientras volvemos a su pasado, al cómo se conocieron sus padres y todo por lo que han pasado desde entonces.""Las historias familiares son simplemente historias. Son mitos que creamos sobre las personas que vinieron antes que nosotros para dotar nuestras propias vidas de sentido""Tiene un aire similar a Evelyn y Daisy, en el sentido de que hay mucha gente famosa involucrada, pero de alguna forma Taylor logra volver a contar algo distinto y con un estilo distinto. Ya no tenemos a una gran protagonista en su título, ya no gira en torno a una persona, pues en este caso son los cuatro hermanos Riva los protagonistas, aunque sí que Nina lleva la mayor parte del peso sobre sus hombros. El libro se divide en dos tiempos, el presente que narra durante 24 horas lo que sucede el día de la fiesta de los Riva y el pasado que va avanzando desde que los padres de ambos se conocen hasta los momentos importantes de los hermanos. Así es como con esta intercalación de tiempos vamos conociendo a la familia y qué fue lo que los llevó a ser quienes son. El cómo se formó la relación entre ellos y los traumas que todos acarrean por sus infancias.""Era una mujer viviendo en un mundo creado por hombres. Y ya había aprendido tiempo atrás que esos imbéciles siempre se protegen entre ellos. No son capaces de serles fieles a nadie, pero son sorprendentemente protectores entre ellos""Taylor siempre habla de familia, en algunos casos simbólicas, pero acá es una familia real. Cuatro hermanos que se cuidan y que significan todo el uno para el otro. Es muy bonita la forma en que describe su relación, la forma en que crecieron y los pequeños detalles que demuestran lo mucho que se quieren y protegen. El cariño entre los hermanos Riva, a pesar de todas las circunstancias, es hermoso y el eje de la historia. Por lo mismo es interesante el contraste que hace sobre paternidad/maternidad con padres reales y con quienes tienen que hacerse cargo. Es bonita la manera en que nos dice que no todo lo bueno es bueno, ni que todo lo malo lo es.Durante el presente, estas 24 horas del día de la fiesta, vemos cómo distintas asperezas y secretos entre ellos van saliendo a la luz poco a poco hasta que terminan explotando. Sin embargo, también vemos el cómo los hermanos van trabajando sobre ellos a pesar de que cada uno de ellos esté pasando por sus propios problemas y tengan sus propios traumas. Siguen funcionando como familia a pesar de todas las adversidades mientras la fiesta se sale de control como un reflejo de lo que todos ellos guardaron por mucho tiempo.""Ser demasiado autosuficiente era un poco cruel para las personas que te quieren. Les robas la oportunidad de saber lo bien que se siente dar a los demás, les impides descubrir su valor""La prosa de Taylor sigue siendo maravillosa y se desliza con gracia, las páginas pasan con rapidez mientras vamos del presente al pasado, de un hermano a otro, de un personaje a otro. Porque en este libro también seguimos a los distintos asistentes a la fiesta, aquellos que querían un poco de fama, los que buscaban limpiar su imagen, los que buscaban arruinar la suya y así. Vamos saltando de uno a otro mientras se nos termina de contar la historia de los Riva. Esto le da un toque sumamente dinámico a la historia porque vamos de forma continua pasando de un foco a otro mientras el tiempo sigue avanzando.Malibú renace es la prueba de que Taylor no tiene un solo estilo para contar historias ni que necesita una sola protagonista para hacerlo. Es cierto que hay aspectos recurrentes como la paternidad/maternidad, la familia, la sororidad, el encontrarse a sí misma y la aceptación. Pero el libro logra ser refrescante y también familiar dentro de sus otras historias.""Dejar que los demás te quieran y te cuiden forma parte de amarlos y cuidarlos"""
2491,4.0,"1983 - es brennt. Mal wieder. In Malibu ist man das Feuer gewohnt. Fast jedes Jahr gibt es Waldbrände an der Küste Kaliforniens und hin und wieder greifen die Flammen auf das Wohngebiet am Meer über. Alles wie immer - nur, dass es diesmal doch ganz anders ist.Obwohl Nina, Hud, Jay und Kit die Kinder des erfolgreichen Sängers Mick Riva sind, wachsen sie in relativer Armut auf. Großgezogen von einer Mutter, deren Traum vom gemeinsamen Glück sich recht schnell als einseitig erwiesen hat. Jetzt, wo sie junge Erwachsene sind, organisieren und feiern sie jährlich die sagenumwobene Riva-Sommerparty, deren Ausmaße mit jeder Party größer werden. Einfache Bewohner Malibus drängen sich hier neben Hollywoodstars, ist doch die einzige Voraussetzung für eine Einladung, dass man von der Party weiß. 1983 soll die Party eine ganz neue Dimension erreichen, schon früh am Abend ist allen Rivas klar, dass dieses Jahr nichts so ist wie in den Jahren davor. Jedes Geschwister hat sein eigenes Päckchen zu tragen und gerade an diesem Sommerabend wird jeder der Rivas mit seinen Problemen konfrontiert. Als dann auch noch Mick Riva, der alternde Rockstar auftaucht, spitzt sich eine jahrzehnte lang schwelende Familientragödie zu._______________________________Vom Klappentext ausgehend hätte ich erwartet, dass dies mein liebstes Buch von Jenkins Reid wird. Geschwisterstories können mich eh immer catchen und die Rivas sind auch noch in genau der gleichen Kombination aufgewachsen wie ich! (Schwester - gleichaltrige Brüder - kleine Schwester). Außerdem erinnere ich mich nur zu gerne an meine recht kurze Zeit in Malibu zurück - die Pazifikküste rund um LA ist einfach wunderschön. Trotzdem muss ich zugeben, dass Malibu Rising etwas hinter den Erwartungen zurückbleibt. Obwohl die Hintergrundgeschichte ausführlich geschildert wurde, konnte ich keine richtig tiefe Beziehung zu den Protagonisten aufbauen. Ich bewundere Ninas Emanzipation und fand das Verhältnis der Geschwister schön zu lesen. Der Schreibstil war ebenfalls (wie immer bei Jenkins Reid) wunderbar. Auch das Abhängigkeitsverhältnis der Eltern wurde gründlich beleuchtet - hier hätte ich mir vielleicht noch eine etwas kritischere Betrachtung gewünscht, aber mir ist natürlich klar, dass die Kinder des Paares da einen subjektiven Blick drauf haben. Außerdem wurden viele andere soziale Themen nur oberflächlich angesprochen und dann relativ schnell wieder fallengelassen. Schönes Sommerbuch, aber meine Erwartungen waren nach Evelyn Hugo einfach etwas höher. Pluspunkte für das wirklich wunderschöne Cover."
2492,5.0,"Malibu Rising was my book clubs read of July and I devoured it within the first few days of reading it! Set in the 1980s - Malibu was one of the hippest places to be! The story starts with flash backs to the four Riva siblings mum and dad and their romance when first meeting. I so routed for June and Mick to survive their love story, but upon Mick getting famous, this sadly was ripped apart. My heart broke for June on more than one occasion- and the selfless acts she carried out (especially with Hud) just made me love her so much more! The siblings are Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit and although they grow up with a dead beat for a dad, they have a strong siblings bond and a strong, devoted mother. Each siblings has a beautiful personality and each has their own stories developing. I don't want to write much more because I don't want to spoil this book for anyone!The party Nina throws has a huge surprise in store (one of a few actually).This book contained so many thought providing statements and moments and has embedded itself deep into my heart! I can't wait to read more from Taylor Jenkins Reid and find she is fast becoming a huge favourite of mine!!"
2493,2.0,"taylor jenkins reid is an incredibly talented writer, but i didn’t connect with this one. i felt very sad the whole time. i was so sad for june, and i was so sad for the kids. i also didn’t enjoy the wild riva party. i didn’t like reading about the random party guests and the topics that were discussed through their point of views. but i will say this was a very atmospheric read and taylor knows how to write well-rounded characters. my favorite themes from the book were june’s love for her children and the tight-knit bond of the siblings."
2494,4.0,"O começo desse livro foi perfeito! Eu tinha plena certeza que ia virar favorito porque eu tava tão entretida e apegada com pouquíssimas páginas que eu já sabia que ia amar.Mas aí na parte dois deu uma arrastada, não teve mais flashback, diminuiu o ritmo mas mesmo assim ainda tava confiante e amando super. Só que o final… um tanto quanto bittersweet pra mim. Não é que eu achei ruim, mas eu esperava uma coisa totalmente diferente do que foi, e nao sei… parece que faltou uma parte do livro, que talvez aconteceu tudo muito rápido e de um jeito que não era pra ser.Só que não tem como não elogiar o livro e a autora, porque eu fiquei extremamente apegada aos irmãos Riva e a June, só espera um pouquinho mais do final.The beginning of this book was perfect! I was pretty sure I was going to become a favorite because I was so entertained and attached! With very few pages I already knew I was going to love it.But then in part two I got a little bored, there was no more flashback, the pace slowed down... but I was still confident.But the ending… a little bit bittersweet for me. It's not that I thought it was bad, but I expected something totally different from what it was, and I don't know… it seems that a part of the book was missing, that maybe everything happened too quickly and in a way that wasn't meant to be.But it's impossible not to praise the book and the author, because I was extremely attached to the Riva brothers and June, I just wanted a different ending."

Jo, tu žinai, kad visi gyvens ilgai ir laimingai, kaip ir žinai, kur čia kabliukai ir kur mygtukai, kad ašara ištrykštų, bet nu tinkamai juos suspaudinėjus, neįmanoma nepataikyt. Ir Taylor Jenkins Reid įrodo, kad moka rašyti, o svarbiausia – moka mokytis. Ji auga kaip kūrėja, kaip rašytoja, ir malonu tai stebėti, nes MALIBU – tikrai visa galva aukščiau mano akyse už, pavyzdžiui, Daisy Jones. Ir kai nebando rašyti apie tai, ko neišmano – rokenrolą, meilę muzikai, vidinę roko virtuvę – T.J.Reid šauna ir pataiko. Nes jausmus ir žmones ji supranta. O šita knyga, nors ir pridengta banglentėmis, Malibu palmėmis, blizgučiais ir glamūru, vis tiek galiausiai yra būtent apie tai. Jausmus ir žmones.Veikėjai ir jų sukalimas, likimai ir jų peripetijos man vietomis šiek tiek priminė legendinį serialą „Shameless“, vietomis – saldoką „90210“. Viskas būtent taip, kaip ir norėtum: muilas, bet tas kvepiantis, malonus. Cukrus, bet ne diabetas. Aišku, tikrai ne psichologinis romanas, veikėjų charakterių pjūviai nebent sviestiniu peiliu, ne chirurginiu skalpeliu, bet ir ne toks atvejis, kur pasivartysi su knyga paplūdimy ir pamirši – liks bent tas malonus jausmas, kad gerai praleidai laiką. Gal mano skoniui ir buvo galima iš knygos išmesti kokius 50 puslapių, o ir vietomis akcentus būčiau sudėjusi gal subtiliau, bet neabejoju, kad dar kitu romanu TJR jau bus atkalus ranką ir šitiems niuansams.

2496,5.0,"Malibú Renace ha sido un viaje maravilloso y un final digno a esta trilogía que se ha posicionado como una de mis lecturas favoritas de la vida.Creo que inevitable la comparación con Evelyn Hugo y Daisy Jones, libros que apelan de forma más directa al lector fiel a las personalidades avasalladoras de sus protagonistas, son historias donde el centro del universo son estas dos mujeres con todas sus imperfecciones y deseos, sus batallas, sus amores y desamores, sus tragedias y alegrías.En Malibú Renace los personajes a lo mejor no brillan de forma tan intensa como en Daisy o Evelyn, pero es porque la historia se divide en un grupo de hermanos y el vínculo que los une. Hasta la mitad del libro estuve convencida de que no iba a amar del todo esta historia, pero que sin duda sería un buen libro. El tema es que esta novela está escrita con mil y un hilos que dan la impresión de algo muy disperso, pero ya llegando a cierta página Taylor empieza a apretar estos hilos y se teje el tapiz, consigues una historia solida, redonda, emotiva y redentora, hilarante y absurda. El final me hizo llorar pero porque fue un gran cierre.Adoro el tono que le dio a este libro porque sin duda se diferencia de sus otras historias, pero sigue siendo ella y su forma tan característica de escribir personajes notables e historias que atrapan y emocionan."
2497,4.0,trust taylor jenkins reid to make you cry. this was beautiful!! 
2498,5.0,Um hello why was this book so good and why has it taken me years to read Taylor Jenkins Reid books???? 
2499,5.0,Taylor Jenkins Reid has done it yet again. SO GOOD
2500,4.0,"TJR did something incredible here. She took a linear, rather bland story and made it special. Malibu Rising is a character-driven piece that will tug at your heart strings. The Riva kids were so authentic and mostly likeable (I'm excluding you, Jay). TJR's writing is layered with so much depth and purpose - she makes her words sing! Are you even human if you don't fall in love with Nina?Having just read Evelyn Hugo, it was such a treat to catch all the name cameos and other little easter eggs sprinkled throughout. Mick Riva wasn't a big character in EH but definitely a memorable one and he did not disappoint in MR.The blowout party seemed like it was fun to write but it was a massive contrast to the endearing story at the core of MR. Nina's story deserved a better backdrop than the sex, drugs, and rock & roll MR will be remembered for.And holy secondary characters, Batman! You might need a pen to write them all down. TJR did tie them all up nicely at the end but it can be a bit confusing if you're not reading the last half in mostly one sitting.June 2021 BOTM selection. Cheers!"
2501,2.0,"Check out my new Booktube channel!I adored The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones & The Six so I'm utterly baffled by how disappointing and lackluster this new TJR novel turned out to be.All I wanted was a compelling family drama which was present in the novel but was unfortunately buried under very unlikable (sometimes to the point of being ridiculous) characters, shallow writing, and A LOT OF FILLER. You can clearly see how the author wanted this story to be SO deep and dramatic, but in my opinion both aspects entirely failed due to the execution.The first half of the book was decent and readable enough. It alternated between the past with the siblings' childhood and the story of their parents, and the present with the siblings getting ready for their annual party and having their own personal struggles. None of it made me love the characters and feel emotional but I still quite enjoyed reading that part.Now, the second one... was a total disaster. It took place during the big party with hundreds of show business stars getting drunk, doing cocaine, having sex, and destroying the house. In the midst of that chaos the siblings deal with their drama and have some character development. Sounds pretty interesting, right? Well, it would be if the author hadn't decided to include ALMOST 20 short chapters about random people whom we learn about, see them do some crazy shit like swinging on a chandelier or having a public threesome in jacuzzi, and then instantly forget about their existence. None of those chapters affect the main story and characters in any way. That egregious use of filler is inexcusable in my opinion.Then, as I said before, there were some pretty unlikable characters. Out of 25+ POVs I only liked 2 - the sisters Nina and Kit. Everyone else was shockingly shallow, naïve, selfish, and annoying. Especially Mick Riva who for some reason gets a long scene at the end where he tries to redeem himself while being the biggest piece of shit out of all of them.I will not be recommending this book to anyone but I already know most people will love and praise it. I guess if you are not a critical reader and just want an entertaining book where you can turn off your brain... but no, there are still better books for that than this one. Maybe I'm harsher than usual here because I know TJR can do much better and I expected a lot more.This eARC was provided by Ballantine Books via Netgalley in exchange for my honest review."
2502,4.0,"So I know a lot of people are disappointed with Malibu Rising after Daisy and the Six… but I thought this was better than Daisy. Unpopular opinion but I think Daisy and the Six is quite overhyped and was not that great. I’m surprised that I actually really enjoyed this one even though I had quite a few issues with it. I really enjoyed the first half, I loved reading about the Riva kids and their struggle with trying to make ends meet and take care of each other. I loved all of them, especially Nina. Her character development and strength was well written. I want to give her a big hug and tell her that she is doing amazing. In fact, I would love a where are they now.I also loved the setting but that may be biased because I live like 20 or 30 minutes away from Malibu LOL. The flashbacks between the past and current was well done, in my opinion. Now what I didn’t like.. June deserved more justice rather than her whole character arc being centered around Mick Riva. Mick himself, is an absolute piece of shit. Same with Brandon.Once the party begins, we get the point of view of random guests and celebrities and while I get that that can be appealing, I feel like it took away from the Riva kids. So I liked it to an extent but I feel like some of it could have been left out. The other thing I didn’t like was that there was SOO much added drama to the point where it felt like it was just added for shock value. Some of it was a little too much in my opinion but I guess it wasn’t that big of a deal. Overall, I actually really liked this book and will be thinking about some of these characters for awhile. This book evoked a lot of feelings within me from rage, sadness, annoyance, and even relief. Thank you so much to Netgalley and to the publisher for an advanced copy of this book!"
2504,1.0,"I did not like this book. Stereotypical trash people doing stereotypically trashy things. No redeeming qualities to be found in any of the characters except Nina, the martyr, who was a cookie cutter oldest sibling. The rest of the book is three pages describing someone’s pink dress or their topsider loafers or introducing a character that doesn’t appear again in the rest of the story. Sorry to be so honest but...I am really surprised the person who wrote Evelyn Hugo wrote this. Evelyn Hugo was one of the best books I read last year. Sorry To TJR, I swear I still love her. Not very book is for everyone and I am sure many people will love this even though it wasn’t for me."
2505,5.0,if you give this book less than 5 stars i will be coming for you. holy shit ** spoiler** i fuckin knew it was going to be mick who started the fire like from that one line in the book in the beginning i knew it. let me say i have a deep hatred for him and all of them deserved so much better. nina and june especially. this story was insane especially the plot twists i just am in shock. LIKE CASEY OMG. i knew mick was a man whore but i was just like wow. and nina literally is my new fav character ever she literally carried this entire book. i honestly believe this is my fav out of all of taylor jenkins reid books and everyone should go read rn.

2507,2.0,"This family of surfers never really caught fire with me. There were teasers throughout, but when the climactic ""out of control"" party happens, even that didn't take off. There were too many characters, all pretty standard. Nothing original, but then, Daisy and the Six was good and a hard act to follow. Wish I'd liked it more."
2508,4.0,"I have always had reliable experiences with Taylor Jenkins Reid's work, and this book solidified why. In pursuit of a perfect novel, the main thing I look for are quality characters, and TJR consistently delivers on that front.That being said, it's hard to rate this book when you compare it to The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, or Daisy Jones and the Six, because while in my opinion it was amazing at face value, there was something missing here in comparison that I can't quite put my finger on. With the other two, I felt like the barrier between fiction and reality blurred, and I almost found myself searching for the characters in real life because they felt so believable to me; I just needed more of them. In Malibu Rising, I still felt the barrier I usually feel when I'm reading a book but not quite a part of it. And while there is nothing wrong with that, and I think it's quite normal, it's just so hard to properly rate the book for what it is without unfairly comparing. Plainly speaking, is this my favourite book by this author? No. Is this an great book for what it is? Yes. Nina was my favourite character by a landslide; she exudes first born daughter energy if I've ever seen it, and I can relate to that. Her character development by the end was something I didn't really expect, but I enjoyed the direction it took. I really liked the other Riva siblings too, and I was so invested in each of their dramas and points of view. I also loved the back and forth timelines between their parents childhood's to theirs, and each hour leading up to and during the party; it kind of gave me a sense of why each sibling turned out to be how they were in adulthood, and I liked how that built the characters from the ground up. I really enjoyed this book; it made me feel like I was on the beach in 70s/80s Malibu. If you're looking for the perfect summer beach read, add this to your list!"
2509,5.0,"you guys... this book deserves all the fucking stars in the universe. simply one of the best books taylor jenkins reid has written. i finished this in a day and my eyes have been glued to the pages since morning. i feel for june and the kids. having been raised by a single mother myself, i feel a deep connection with their story. taylor jenkins reid did an exceptional job in giving us a glimpse of the hardships and struggles faced by 'broken' families. i smiled, i cried, i tried to contain myself from angst. everything felt so real that i had to remind myself how this was all fictional. overall, i think that everyone should read this book."
2510,4.0,"TJR does it again, book buddies! I was so sucked into this novel - the story, the characters, the settting! And now that I’m done, I can not wait for everyone to pick it up this summer. It's an unputdownable family story that yes, will be the perfect beach read. But it's also the perfect cuddled under blankets, or on the subway, or morning cup of coffee read. However you read, I definitely recommend you pick this one up! I think every TJR book should be adapted to film, but this one especially just always had a cinematic quality for me as I read. Maybe it's the house party theme that made me nostalgic for the teenage romantic comedies of the nineties and early two thousands. This book is so engaging and I think it's one of those reads that is as heavy as you want it to be for you as a reader. It definitely tackles some incredibly difficult topics - alcoholism, child abandonment, broken families - without romanticizing the trauma. The only thing that didn't work for me were some of the secondary plot lines. To give the party depth, the author would focus for a few pages on vignettes of characters at the party - and sometimes they were really interesting and insightful, but I think by the climax of the novel I was so into the main plot that those asides started to feel like too much and a distraction from the story I was really there for reading."

2512,5.0,"When driving along the Pacific Coast Highway through the 27-mile stretch of Malibu, you can’t help being fascinated by the area’s glamour. You know that along the beach, there’s a way of life most of us have never experienced. Author Taylor Jenkins Reid, takes us into 28150 Cliffside Drive and the world of the Riva family. Malibu Rising starts on August 27, 1983 at 7am. We learn that 24 hours later, the large cliffside beach house of Nina Riva will have been lost to a terrible fire. The Riva siblings (Nina, Jay, Hud, Kit) have been through a lot. But by 1983 they have survived and are thriving. They are a close knit group and support one another. They are preparing for their annual end-of-summer party which has grown and now attracts a who’s who of celebrities and powerful Hollywood figures as well as in-the-know locals. Twenty-five year old Nina, the oldest of the group and a successful swimsuit model, decides to hold the party even after her husband, a top professional tennis player, has left her for another woman. The story alternates between the ill-fated day of the party and the poignant history of parents June and Mick Riva, starting in 1956. They meet at the beach and fall madly in love as Mick is starting his career as a singer. Once he hits the big time and starts performing across the country, his roving eye becomes a problem. Back to 1983 and the party is out of control. Secrets are revealed and the strength of the siblings’ bond is tested. I find author Taylor Jenkins Reid’s writing style very appealing. She tells a story in a way that pulls you right into the lives of her characters. This is a story of family, relationships, struggles, drive, self-discovery. The party is over-the-top with a large number of people, who are used to doing what they want with little to no consequences, behaving very badly. But the heart of the book is the relationship of the sisters and brothers which made this a strong read for me. (If you have read my favorite book by the author, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, you may remember that Mick Riva was one of the husbands. He also made a very brief appearance in Daisy Jones and the Six. We’ll have to see if any of the Rivas pop up again in future books. I hope so.)Many thanks to NetGalley, Ballantine / Random House and the author for the opportunity to read Malibu Rising in advance of its June 1, 2021 publication. The author’s last two books are heading for screen adaptations and I would expect this book will find its way to the big or small screen as well. It deserves it. Rated 4.5 stars.Review posted on MicheleReader.com."
2513,4.0,"Thank you NetGalley and the publisher for an eARC in exchange for an honest review.Taylor Jenkins Reid once again wrote a phenomenal book. I don’t know how she manages to write such amazing books that right from the beginning you are mesmerized and can’t seem to look away or stop reading. Malibu Rising was a slow burn read for me, unlike Daisy Jones and Evelyn Hugo which were fast paced and had my heart racing. While this was slower for me, TJR still made me fall in love with the story, the characters, the glamour and glitz of the 80’s.In Malibu Rising we are following the famous Riva kids who are now grown, Nina, Jay, Hud, and Kit. Nina throws an outrageous party once a year at her house in Malibu and everyone is invited. This book takes place over 24 hours, the hours before the party, during the party, and after the party. We get multiple perspectives and we get some chapters of the past. Mick and June Riva are the parents of the famous four and we get to see where they came from, how they fell in love, and so much more.Malibu Rising was about heartbreak, love, tragedies, family relationships, and the wildness of the 80’s in Malibu. I absolutely 100% fell in love with this wild, imperfect, amazing characters. I loved the love the four siblings had for each other, even in adulthood they are just as close. Reid writes such realistic and deep characters that aren’t perfect and make mistakes and you fall head over heels for them. The flashbacks we get of how Mick and June first met and then Mick becoming the famous singer Mick Riva. We see the heartache that June went through, the sadness and pain that Mick caused. Nine having to take care of her three younger siblings when she had no parent to turn to. Living paycheck to paycheck and most the time that wasn’t enough. It was heartbreaking to read, but also inspiring to see how they made themselves into the very rich Riva’s in the 80’s.Even though this book only spans 24 hours, by the end you feel like you know the Riva siblings inside and out. The secrets and struggles that we get in just 24 hours that lead up to the crazy ending has your head spinning and your heart full of love for these wonderful characters. Not to mention this takes place in Malibu during the 80’s so that alone is a wild ride to read about. Reid writes such beautiful details that it felt like I was at the famous Riva party. I really loved this book so much and while it didn’t hit the mark that Daisy Jones and Evelyn Hugo did for me, it is still a book I will be thinking about for a long time."
2514,4.0,"Thank you so much to NetGalley and the publisher, Ballantine Books, for the opportunity to read this exceptional book. I've had it on my TBR for quite some time and could smack myself for waiting so long to read it. I've never been to California, but I felt like this book propelled me back in time to two significant eras, the 1960s, and the early 1980s.It's August 1983, and as the story begins, it seems that Nina Riva and her siblings must have lived a life of privilege and renown. All too soon, that notion is disabused. Nina is preparing for her annual end-of-summer party at her beautiful home in Malibu. Nina is a famous model and surfer; brother Jay is a championship surfer, and brother Hud, a prominent photographer. Their youngest sibling, Kit, is still trying to find herself. Between them, they have a great cast of friends, both famous and wannabes. And they are all heading to the party of the year.As I mentioned, the story is told in alternating timelines. In the 1960s, their father, aspiring singer Mick Riva, meets the beautiful young June and promises her a life of love, riches, and prestige. As his star rises, his promises begin to fall by the wayside. He can't be faithful, and he breaks June's heart. Not only does he leave her, but he leaves his children physically, emotionally, and financially. June sacrifices everything to raise her children until she can't anymore. Nina, as the oldest is left to take over.Now in 1983, on party day, the Riva siblings have survived and are thriving, but they each have secrets that threaten their happiness. A lot is going on in this book, but I devoured every bit of it like a crazy fangirl. There are multiple storylines, but I had no trouble keeping up and enjoyed all of it. No doubt about it, this author knows how to tell a story! Was it perfect? No, but it's one of those remarkable tales that stick with you for a long time. I gave it four and a half stars rounded down to four."
2515,5.0,"TJR does it again! Another 5 star book for me. I loved this story. I couldn't get enough. It was juicy and interesting. The audiobook narrator is one of my favorites so the listening experience was so great. I loved the characters. I thought Nina would be a stuck-up rich girl, but she was the exact opposite. I loved it so much!"
2516,5.0,"BOOKSTAGRAM | BOOK BLOG | AMAZONThe hype was SO real with this one. There’s no plot, no end game — it’s just a real family going through really real problems. I liked the Mick and June flash backs, it really put the story of the kids into perspective and you kept guessing when these kids were born during Mick and June’s relationship. I cried towards the end, it’s just such raw writing and you feel for the characters. The only weird parts were Casey—I’m still confused on her and then the legit ending, it just seemed not the right ending for the book, or maybe it was since it was brought up before?! I also loved how in the beginning TJR brought up small things from her past books about what people would come out with and confess during her annual end of summer bash. This book kept me so interested especially with it being more of a family drama book which that genre is really hard for me to get into. But she did it again and I was hooked from page one!"

“How were you supposed to change- in ways both big and small- when your family was always there to remind you of exactly the person you apparently signed an ironclad contract to be?”
WHAT DOES TJR PUT IN HER BOOKS?????? Is it crack? Is it literal fairy magic? The world may never know. They're so addicting to read. It's another world, and just so magical to read. If there has ever been an author whose books were MEANT for the big screen, it's TJR's.But what I do know is that Malibu Rising is the perfect third-book to this historical contemporary thing TJR has going on. I'm not really interested in reading her other contemporaries, but if they're anything as good as these three are... Also, if you asked me to tell you which of the three were my favorites.... I don't think I'd be able to tell you. I love them all for completely different reasons. 
“Nina understood, maybe for the first time, that letting people love you and care for you is part of how you love and care for them.”
Malibu Rising takes place in the 80s and follows the children of a familiar character from The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, Mick Riva (can we just mention how this man comes up literally everywhere? I haven't forgotten about that Daisy Jones and the Six cameo he made. It's like we can't get away from him. Someone said that these books take place in the Mick Riva Universe, and I'm inclined to agree with this statement)We follow Riva's four kids, and their mother, June, in a dual timeline: June's story with Mick, and present day, where we follow Nina, Hud, Jay, and Kit throughout the timeline of 24 hours, with a party that ends in a fire that changes everything.I would like to just say that I understand why a lot of people were more into Daisy Jones and the Six and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, probably because a lot more happened in those than in this one. Malibu Rising, instead of focusing on characters and their personalities, focuses on the relationships between our main characters. It got a little slow at times, but I personally just really enjoyed it throughout. (also the cover isn't my favorite and I thought it was birds flying at first lmao but then I understood at the end and the symbolism is so sweet omg) 
“She had to choose what, of the things she inherited from the people who came before her, she wanted to bring forward. And what, of the past, she wanted to leave behind.”
I was thinking in the beginning about how one full-length book would take place during 24 hours, but it was smart the way that Reid planned it out and took up a little less than half the length to show us June's story too. This book had one of those rare moments when I discovered that I loved both stories happening simultaneously equally, and I just always wanted to know what happens next at any given moment. We follow with the theme from Reid's last two books with the fame and glamorous, but this one had considerably less, in my opinion, than the last book. It was more.... I don't know... homely, though it's the perfect beach read. The characters were also very interesting to me. One thing I loved are the multitude of characters getting a one-time POV and then coming together in the end. Thankfully, this book didn't leave me feeling as depressed like with the other two, but super enjoyable. 
“Our family histories are simply stories. They are myths we create about the people who came before us, in order to make sense of ourselves.”
June reminded me very much of Camilla from DJatS. Very kind, forgiving, family-oriented but highly underestimated by annoying men. June deserved so much better, and I will die on this hill. Her story made me want to cry. Her arc and story over time was just very well-written and the honesty and reality of her story was beautiful and heartbreaking.Nina might've been my favorite character in the entire book. She's the definition of a girl-boss, and all that she did for her family at such a young age really got to me. Out of all the characters, I would say I see myself the most in Nina, and maybe that's why I like her the most, but Nina is a queen (Ninas are superior. We've already seen this proof with the queen Nina Zenik).I also loved Jay. Maybe his character arc wasn't as deep as, say, Nina's, but I still really enjoyed his character. Hud... I was okay with. Some of his decisions made in this book were questionable, but I still liked reading about him. I personally found his story to be the least interesting of the four, but still fun to read.Kit was so fun to read about. She's also just such an awesome character and I adore her. She's just so cool. I am the opposite of cool, but I would love to be that level of awesome as Kit is. Mick Riva can literally die. This man has done nothing good in any book. Seriously. Has this man actually done anything useful? Please just go off and die in a ditch <3 
“Family is found...whether it be blood or circumstance or choice, what binds us does not matter. All that matters is that we are bound.”
Malibu is such a nice setting for this book. It takes place in the 80s, so around the same time period of TSHoEH and DJatS, and well deserves it's own show just like the others (but I do think this book is getting it's own show just like the others, which I'm so excited for omg). I'm getting serious beach wanderlust from this book, and all I want to do after reading this book is celebrate the ending by going to a beach and learning to surf.Seriously, surfing sounds like so much fun after reading Malibu Reading. They just made it sound so exciting and fun and now I just want someone to teach me how to surf so I can do it too, despite the fact that I have zero athletic ability and that I've never really had the wish to surf before. 
“Just because it is in Malibu's nature to burn, so was it in one particular person's nature to set fire and walk away.”
Okay, I am very possibly going into a TJR-fueled contemporary binge, and now I will be reading any contemporary book in sight. Have a good day, and read this book <3 5 stars!"
2518,3.0,"3.9 / 5Honestly, I kept waiting for something to happen with this one. I read it as a buddy read, and we both agreed that not only were the Mick and June bits infinitely more interesting than that of the Riva siblings, we just expected more from Taylor Jenkins Reid. My favourite bits were where you could see the crossover with other books like SHOEH and DJATS, and I feel like there were multiple places where I was trying to pick up hints where there were none. What I did like were the backstory bits and that's where TJR's writing in this book shines. You will blow past the pages here, but the destination might not be something you're particularly looking forward to because the ending was a massive letdown. "
2519,3.0,"Loved the opening and the first segment, it was practically perfect. It did derail a bit for me though, the only Riva sibling I liked reading about was Nina. I'm glad TJR is trying out more different formats, but this book doesn't hold a candle to Daisy Jones. "

2522,4.0,"4 starsYou can read all of my reviews at Nerd Girl Loves Books.This is a really good contemporary fiction that follows one fictional famous family that lives in Malibu in August 1983. The book focuses on the children of legendary singer Mick Riva, who have earned fame in their own right. Through flashbacks that explain the love story, and heartbreak, of their parent's relationship, the readers get a glimpse into the chaotic, secretive life of Nina, Jay, Hud and Kit.Nina is a surfer and supermodel, Jay is a championship surfer, Hud is a renowned surfer photographer, and Kit wants to be surf champ. As we learn more about the kid's history, we get a glimpse into how each copes with the abandonment, one literally and one figuratively, of their parents, and how it taints their ability to deal with problems. The book is well written and grabbed my attention from the start. The author does a great job of painting a picture of Malibu in the 1980s. She slowly unfolds each character and their unique qualities. I was completely swept away by the story and found myself reading late into the night. The nostalgic touches of 1980's were fun to read and brought back my own memories of those times.I received a complimentary copy of this book from NetGalley and Ballantine Books. All opinions are my own."
2523,5.0,"I'm convinced that Taylor Jenkins Reid could rewrite the phone book and I would rush to the bookstore to buy it.This book was so amazing and in typical Taylor Jenkins Reid fashion, the story, characters and the lives of the characters felt so real that I forgot that I was reading a fictional novel. Taylor Jenkins Reid just has this amazing way of writing that puts the reader right into the story and this book is no different. This is the third book by Taylor Jenkins Reid that has left me speechless (and I can talk a lot so that is hard to do) and I have a feeling her next one will do the same."
2524,5.0,"This is the third book I’ve read by Taylor Jenkins Reid and it was just as good or even better. In fact, I have enjoyed her books so much that I want to read all of them. She is an adept storyteller that knows how to engage the reader and keep them turning those pages.Malibu Rising is the story of a multi-generational family. It has its share of flawed characters and family dysfunction but also strong characters. The characters are sufficiently fleshed out as are their relationships. The story is somewhat more focused on the oldest child Nina and her yearly big party. Nina knows that family histories repeat and questions if they are inescapable or if they can be changed.Nina is on the quintessential journey — search for self. She has struggled between what she needs to be, as dictated by circumstances, versus who she really is or wants to be. And, she comes to learn what she does not want to be on the way. It is fascinating to watch as Nina evolves and her siblings adjust to her. The siblings all have their own challenges and some of their relationships are especially problematic. But the one relationship that is the most complicated for all of them is with their famous father, who abandoned them when they were young and who now tries to make amends when they are fully grown and have their own lives. I loved the fire metaphor, which sandwiches the story at the beginning and end. While fire can be extremely destructive, it is also a time of new beginnings. The story is told in present day with flashbacks throughout, providing the relevant back story. There are some lIttle snippets about tertiary characters who are rarely mentioned again in the book, more towards the end. Normally I find this technique to be an unwelcome distraction but due to TJR’s skill, I was sucked right in to each of them, intrigued by the characters and relationships. I highly recommend this book and others by Taylor Jenkins Reid.Thank you to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine Books and NetGalley for an advance reader copy in exchange for my honest opinion."

“Just because it is in Malibu's nature to burn, so was it in one particular person's nature to set fire and walk away.”
And burn it did. The drama. The secrets. Mick’s fucking audacity. That was a wild ride. This was my first TJR book and it won't be the last. I chose this first rather than her other highly acclaimed works because the premise intrigued me the most. The story mainly focuses on the parents, June and Mick, and how their decisions and failed marriage affect the children's lives. The events that conspire are more saddening than frustrating, but I admit that I was surprised at how much of the book is dedicated to June and Mick. Their influence on their kids is undeniable but ultimately, the climax wasn't directly tied to them and the synopsis isn't focused on them.While I also pity June and literally want to push Mick off a cliff for what he did, I appreciate how realistic their relationship is. Then again, I'm a teen who hasn't been in any relationship let alone a shitty one so who am I to judge lolThe reason I settled on a 3.75 was because while I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the setting, I was let down for the reason above and in the final segment (aka the party), there are literally 18 guests introduced all at once that aren't mentioned again til the end. They are mere ""filler"". We didn't need more than maybe 5 of these people since 18 was damn near impossible to keep track of.The plot twists were also quite predictable since the foreshadowing was quite heavy and the writing was on the nose, but it was still entertaining nonetheless.Other than these complaints, I still thoroughly enjoyed the story and felt satisfied. Maybe I'm loving this in particular because I wish I was alive in the '80s and California-born-and-raised, but oh well.Pre Release Reviewthis sounds like a slightly more tropical and scandalous Keeping Up with the Kardashians. . . . I NEED IT.(and no, i have never watched that show nor have I read any TJR books)"
2526,5.0,"4.5 stars rounded up.I read this book about a month and a half ago and wanted to wait to write my review to sit with the story a bit. When I finished the book I was devastated to leave the Riva family behind. I will say that I am still sad to leave them behind, but the book did not stick with me quite as much as I thought so I have taken it down a 1/2 star to 4.5 star rating.TJR again creates a world that feels so real, like she is writing an expose on a famous family. This time she brings us back to ""gullible Mick Rivas"" from Evelyn Hugo's world. Mick is a famous musician and has an ex wife and children he left behind. The story revolves around two time periods for his family. The first is the story of June and Mick's love tragic love story starting in the 1950s and progressing from there. The second storyline is set over the span of 24 hours in 1983. The children are gearing up for their annual giant bash at the oldest sister, Nina's, fancy home on the coast.I loved the flashbacks and seeing their family form and their story unfold. I felt for June and Nina and the rest of the children as their family came together and did their best to cope (not always in a positive manner) with the tough hands they were dealt. I cried for June, I cried for Nina, I cried for the children brought into such dysfunction who found a way to thrive.The ""now"" (1983) chapters took me a little longer to get into, I didn't feel the emotions that I felt during the flashback chapters. These held more drama and personal secrets for the Riva's children and allowed us to see who they had become from their rough start in life. Then we got to the party and it became more entertaining while also serving a large purpose in the children's character development. Some elements of the party just seemed manic with the drug and alcohol induced debauchery, but it helped to build that aforementioned real life expose feel. By the end I loved the party scene as well just in a different way than the flashback chapters.Thank you to NetGalley and Ballantine Books for an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.Expected publication date: June 1, 2021"
2527,4.0,"It took me a bit to get into this book and I finally purchased the audio to get me going, but I honestly think it was more of an issue with my mood than it was the book. Once I had the audio, I flew through the story and I really enjoyed it a lot. This book was narrated by Julia Whelan, who did an excellent job bringing life to the story. I like the way Taylor Jenkins Reid builds her characters and her stories. In my opinion, her stories build somewhat slowly, adding layer over layer. This gives them some depth that I appreciate. The twists and turns aren't typically shocking, but small interesting pieces that gain momentum as the story builds. You're never quite sure what is going to happen, but you know it will be interesting.This is the third story I've read by TJR and I enjoyed it as much as the previous two due to the way she builds her characters. I noticed that she is including Easter eggs along the way and I thought it was fun to see some of the connections to her other stories. I intend to continue reading TJR's work and look forward to seeing what she comes out with next. #MalibuBurning #NetGalleyThank you to Random House Publishing Group / Ballantine Books and NetGalley for providing me with a free electronic copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

2528,5.0,"“ She needed someone to love her. And they could do that. That would be very easy for them to do. June was gone. Yet here she was, living on through her children.”What is it about Taylor Jenkins Reid? How are her words magic every single time? No matter the decade, no matter the scenario, no matter the story… Magic. I find myself so immersed in her novels that I am totally confused when I come up for air. Baffled by my bedside table, my surroundings, my children… Where am I? I honestly felt like I was in Malibu in the 1980s the entire time I read this book.Every single character in this book was so incredibly vivid. You didn’t just get to know them, imagine what they might look like… you get to know their hearts and their fears. Their insecurities and their strengths. Their hidden underbellies, their deepest fears and their Achilles’ tendons. How does she do this every time? Some of these characters only got a paragraph. And yet I *know* them.I fell in love with the Riva family. Every single one of them. I want to hug them, mother them, cheer them on. I stuck so many sticky notes in this book. So many parts touched my soul, moved me, brought tears to my eyes… TJR just speaks to my soul. 5 stars."
2529,5.0,"A FUN SUMMERTIME READ!! Malibu Rising follows the offspring of famous singer and father, Mick Riva who also happened to be one of The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Yes, you heard that right! Mick was Evelyn’s third husband, or at least, until it was annulled the next day.Told in two alternating timelines, it follows the Riva family’s backstory of Mick and June in the 1950’s, and their four children in August 1983, the day of Nina Riva’s annual end-of-summer party in Malibu. Attended by celebrities, rock and sports stars, tv anchors, pretty much The Who’s Who of Tinseltown. It’s legendary. Everyone wants to be seen there. It’s THE party to end all parties. Unfortunately it got completely out of control, ending in arrests and so so much worse.. Nina’s home at 28150 Cliffside Drive and the surrounding Malibu coastline by morning was engulfed in flames.Prepare to be transported to another place and time - where family dysfunction, affairs, secrets, drama, alcohol, drugs and rock ‘n roll play out. There’s a little bit of everything in this book, and I was there for it. The Riva family saga is an unbelievably crazy romp through the decades!"
2530,3.0,"3.5 starsThis is the perfect book to save for a holiday, preferably to read on a beach with an ice cold glass of wine in hand. I think in terms of enjoyment and ability to keep my attention this falls in between Daisy Jones & The Six and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. I really enjoyed getting to know each of the 4 siblings as well as the timeline that deals with their parents, how they met and drifted apart.I do feel the end became too much of a hot mess and each new cameo character seem to just trip things up even more.But overall, this was great escapism!"
2531,5.0,"WOW. This book was extremely well written and absolutely mesmerizing to read about. The novel centers around the Riva family, taking a deep dive into each of their past and present situations leading up to the prologue of the novel. One of the best reads of this year, every chapter had a purpose and left a lasting impression. The style reminded me of the show This Is Us, in how stories of each character are told and revealed. Another highlight of the novel was how everyone's story was connected about how the past is not told in chronological order but based on situations and themes. The ending was also very well done, all the loose ends were tied. A great historical novel! Loved every min of it, this was my first read from this Author, I will be checking her others works for sure!"
2532,4.0,"4.0 StarsWhile not my usual genre, I really enjoyed this one because I love Taylor Jenkin Reid's character work. This one read like a blend of her recent historical fiction while appealing to readers like myself that love her older contemporary fiction. I would recommend this one to anyone who loves this author. You won't be disappointed.Disclaimer I received an audiobook copy from LibroFM at part of their review program. I highly recommend the audio version because Julia Whelan is one of my favourite narrators. "
2535,4.0,"🎧 A stellar listening experience 🎧 “Because just as it is in Malibu’s nature to burn, so was it in one particular person’s nature to set fire and walk away.”This is a story about the Riva family: mother & father: legendary singer Mick & professional surfer/model June & their children: Nina, Hud, Jay & Kit. Every year Nina hosts a huge extravaganza for all the hottest celebs in order to have one last hoo-rah before the end of summer, & this is the first time doing so in her own home. The problem? The house was bought with her pro tennis player husband her who just left her for another woman. Needless to say she’s not feeling up to throwing a party.“...Nina felt a sense of doom as she imagined how the night would play out, the conflict; the mess. This night Nina could feel in her gut, was not going to end well.”But, she’s not the only one in the family all caught up in their feelings, every single person has a story to confess. But which ones will cause a shot gun to be fired, send someone to the hospital & ultimately leave the Riva household to go down in flames as the sun comes up?“I know how it feels to wonder if anyone loves you, if you matter at all.”🎤 Just as in all of TJR’s books about celebrities, by the end of their story you will close the final page believing this family exists in the real world.I throughly enjoyed this book, but I didn’t LOVE it like I did “The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo”, “Daisy Jones & The Six” or “Evidence of the Affair” all 5 star reads for me.However, in my mind, the queen of contemporary/ historical fiction can do no wrong & I’m forever a Taylor Jenkins Reid stan.I can’t wait to re-read this one via print version with a group of my favorite girls later in the summer & see which format I prefer more.Thank you to TJR, Libro FM & Penguin Random House Audio for providing me an ALC in exchange for my honest review. 4 ⭐️."
2536,3.0,"25% of Malibu Rising was about a marriage between a rock star and a ""commoner."" It read like Evelyn Hugo. It was awesome.Another 25% was about the children resulting from the marriage between the rock star and the commoner. There is NOTHING more boring than celebrity children: they're born with everything, have no perspective, and their problems are their own making. Taylor Jenkins Reid fell into the trap of trying to make celebrity kids interesting.Example: the daughter is a famous surf star/model without really trying? Really?The last 50% was about a party that takes place over one night that TJR tried to use to pull the story together. BUT THE KIDS ARE BORING, so it didn't work for me.I could read TJR's best all day. I don't know if some of her characters don't work for me (Malibu Rising kids), or certain storytelling devices don't work for me (Daisy Jones not being first-person narrative), but while she knocked it out of the park with  Evelyn Hugo, Malibu Rising is just ""meh."""
2537,4.0,"I thought this book was terrific and it grabbed me. Yes, it got a little frenetic when the big party started. It is a critical point in the main characters' development. I do understand what the author was trying to convey as I lived there earlier, during that particular time period and beyond, am very familiar with the culture and attitudes and experienced it myself. I attended several similar parties there, saw stuff that would shock most of America and left before it got to the ""chandelier swinging phase."" The amount and variety of drugs (not for me, thank you), sex and rock 'n roll, did happen. I saw people easily recognizable doing things that would ruin lives and careers. As a matter of fact, it was prevalent, even in the law firms I worked in. It was a trip! Anyway, if the author's goal was one of a frenzy of madness, mission accomplished. It was an accurate depiction of the culture, the industry, the area and the people of that time period. Especially when the big money was around.Nina definitely was the standout for me. She was the glue. Selfless, strong and mature way beyond her years. Kit was a pistol. Even through all the trials, those kids stuck together. I also thought it had a good ending to a overall good book. "

""Maybe our parents' lives are imprinted within us, maybe the only fate there is is the temptation of reliving their mistakes.""



Ok, I have to be honest, I did not care for The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and I thought Daisy Jones & The Six was good (not great) and over-hyped. THIS BOOK? This book was my favorite of this author's to date.Reid definitely takes risks in her work and I have to commend her for that, because she isn't afraid to take them. This is like 2 totally different books packed into one. There are two parts to it, and while most of us couldn't even tell you anything of distinction between the different parts of recent reads, in this book? You will know!! Part 1 is an interwoven family drama about the Riva family, beginning with the parents Mick and June Riva, and then their 4 children - Nina, Jay, Hudson, and Kit. Part 2? Part two is ALLLLLLL about the party, literally. It is 13 chapters that all take place, hour by hour, over the span of the annual Riva Malibu bash. I loved part 1 of this book. I so connected with June and my heart broke for her. I love the way this author writes and let me just say, the audio was flawless, as I've come to expect with the brilliant voice of Julia Whelan. We learn all about June and Mick's early years, their dating life, and their marriage. The timeline flips between past and present - past beginning in the mid 1950's, and the present being the morning of the party, in 1983. We learn about the kids and how they grew into adults, and about their bond over surfing. 

""It would be the last time they all surfed together. Even though Jay did not know what would happen over the course of the evening—did not know just what awaited them all—he did know that.""

Mick Riva is a singer/songwriter who rises to huge fame during part 1 of this book. And, unfortunately, while being a talented star, he was a subpar father and husband. 

""For a moment, Jay considered the idea that he would rather die being great than live being ordinary. He wasn’t sure he could bear the stain of obscurity.""

Part 2 is complete craziness!! I'm talking all the bells and whistles you'd imagine in a typical Hollywood bash in the 80's...coke, threesomes in the jacuzzi, sex in the closet, guns, hookups, fights, family feuds...I can go on. It did take me a hot minute to get my bearings because a whole slew of new characters are introduced at the halfway point of the book, which is definitely uncommon. But once I was able to see where the author was going, I really actually liked it. As the reader, you feel like you're at this insane party, and I really would have liked to be. 

""It is Malibu's nature to burn.""

This would make sure a great TV show or film. Was the ending a tiny bit anticlimactic? Maybe... I was still pretty pleased with it...though, I wouldn't have minded if a certain character also went up in flames, but that's just me. All in all, Malibu Rising is the quintessential summertime read...with grit. Thank you to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine for my advanced e-copy of this book, which I read in exchange for an honest review. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I just got the NetGalley approval for this! So flipping excited to read!!! "
2539,4.0,Fun book full of family drama. 
2540,3.0,"Malibu Rising was a bit... underwhelming, but that's only because I had very very very high expectations of it. The writing was fantastic, as always, and very easy to get into. The pace was also pretty on point and held steady throughout the novel. I also enjoyed how the novel was structured and the way in which TJR conveyed background information to us.The novel was told in multiple perspectives, but the most notable ones are the Riva family POVs. It was a bit heartbreaking to read about what each of them had been through, with the exception of Mick, and how that affected them in their adult lives. I had quite a soft spot for Nina and I really loved her character development during the final few chapters.Regarding the plot... this was very much a character-driven and family story, so there weren't any big surprises or reveals or twists about... anything, really. That was underwhelming to me when I considered the entirety of Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones and how I was sort of expecting this novel to emotionally destroy me as much as those two did. When that didn't happen? It disappointed me.The ending also wasn't really what I expected. I did like how it wasn't a happy and magical ending for all. I didn't like that I already knew exactly what was going to happen. It tied into the opening chapter and it was so easy to figure out how and why that had happened. So that fell flat to me. :("
2541,4.0,"Malibu Rising is a delicious and delectable tale ignited by devastating long-held secrets, simmering suspense and intense drama. Mick Riva's four children are known and admired throughout Malibu. But not just for their famous father - a popular singer who rose to meteoric fame almost overnight in the 1950s, which is what helped woo their mother, June, at the time. Having grown up in the shadow of her cheating absentee father, young Nina became the parental figure to her siblings due to her mother’s chronic alcoholism. Now, each year the four throw an epic party to celebrate the end of the summer - it promises to be bigger and better each year. It only lasts a few hours, but it is enough to change their lives forever. Malibu, August 1983. It is the day of Nina Riva's annual party at her beach house, and everyone longs for nightfall and all the excitement it promises to bring. The person least interested in the event is surf model herself Nina, who never liked being the centre of attention and just ended her relationship with a professional tennis player fully exploited by the media. Perhaps surf photographer Hudson is also tense, as he needs to admit to his brother something that he has kept secret for too long, and it seems that this is the moment. Professional surfer Jay is counting the minutes, as he can't wait to find a girl who he can't get out of his head. And Kit, an aspiring pro surfer, also has his special - and guest - secrets. By midnight, the party will be completely out of control. It has become a Riva tradition and it's normal to see celebrities from all around Los Angeles in attendance and equally as normal for it to descend into chaos with incredibly bad behaviour on show but the most affecting drama emanates from the Riva family secrets. Alcohol will flow, music will play and secrets accumulated over generations will come back to haunt everyone - until the early hours of the day, when the first spark arises and the Riva mansion is completely consumed by the flames. This is a compulsive and rapid-fire paced read about celebrity siblings living in beautiful Malibu; the descriptions of the area are nothing short of magnificent - you can feel the searing heat, taste the salt of the sea breeze and see the movers and groovers of the time shimmying around the locale. The descriptions are not only vivid and indulgent but the multiple story arcs are too - they are each handled superbly with seamless switching between times and plot strands detailing the emotional journeys of the four siblings as the tension builds and becomes ever more fraught. Its dual timeline intersects the years 1956–1982 and Mick and June’s love story and subsequent unravelling with the events of one fateful day, Saturday 27th August 1983, which crescendo to a dramatic finale. This is the perfect summer beach read and for those looking for some much sought after escapism, you cannot go wrong with this riveting family drama. Taking place over the course of just 24 hours, this unforgettable story set in 1980s Southern California follows the Riva siblings as they navigate family drama, personal tragedies and their own insecurities. It's warm, decadent, propulsive storytelling with sharp observations and sparkling wit about the hedonism of the time written in an evocative, highly addictive and entertaining manner. Highly recommended."
2542,5.0,"Every element of this story falls into place so perfectly, I am left to marvel yet again at how easily TJR gives me goosebumps. She's an expert storyteller, weaving in and out of time to mirror the story of two generations of Rivas'. This reminded me a lot of all my favorite aspects of Shameless and Big Little Lies. The setting of this novel captivated me just as much as the characters. This is THE ultimate beach read (sorry @ Emily Henry, Beach Read is great but imo its not a beach read so...). Sigh, wish i could read this all over again."
2543,3.0,"I love Taylor Jenkins Reid… so I’m pretty disappointed. Malibu Rising has some very similar themes to Daisy Jones & the Six and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo (which were both 5 star reads for me). This novel follows four siblings who throw the party of the year, every year. Each year is bigger and better than the last. But what happens when a few surprise guests turn up and a whole bunch of secrets come out?This book was good… but not great. There was a lot going on and the character development wasn’t fully there. We also saw points of view from the most random party-goers that didn’t even matter when I would’ve loved for the main characters to be developed further instead. This was a 5/5 for me until about 60% through, when it really started to go downhill. The ending was completely unsatisfying and many things that happened just didn’t make sense. This book will sell. It probably will be at the top of the charts. I know a lot of people will really love this, but unfortunately I didn’t. Expected publication: June 1st, 2020.

2544,5.0,"How could I possibly write a review that would do this book justice? The entire novel is all too perfect. There is not a single flaw. Going into reading this, I had high expectations, but I was not expecting THIS. Within reading the first 50pages, I knew that it would become a favourite of mine. The writing style is compelling, yet beautiful. I fell in love and became deeply connected to the famous Riva siblings, along with the other characters incorporated throughout the book. And on top of all of the that, the plot was fantastic. Whilst reading the beginning of the book I thought it was going to be a cute summer read that goes a bit south... but it was SO much more than that. This book will make your heart smile one moment and then feel like it got ripped out the next. Taylor Jenkins Reid did not miss and I'm looking forward to reading more of her work.The thing I find the most amusing about the entire experience of reading this outstanding book is that I bought it because the cover is very pretty."

Just go and read this book. ♾️/5⭐Thank you NetGalley for providing digital advanced copy in exchange for honest review."
2546,5.0,Review forthcoming
2547,4.0,"So, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo took place from the 50s to the 80s, Daisy Jones & the Six took place in the 70s, and now Malibu Rising in the 80s. Anyone else noticing a pattern here? Is TJR going to deliver us a book in the 90s next? I’m loving this universe she’s creating so if that's the case, I'm not complaining. Also, what happened to the 60s? Anyway, onto the review. Every year, Nina Riva, along with the help of her siblings, Jay, Hud, and Kit, throw an epic party at her house on the cliffs of Malibu. Except this year, all four of their lives will have changed by the time morning comes. Nina has just been left by her pro tennis player husband and is trying to decide what this means for her future. Jay is harboring a life-altering secret. So is Hud, and his could ruin his relationship with his basically-twin-brother forever. And Kit comes to terms with some truths about who she is and what she wants. Being the offspring of the legendary singer, Mick Riva, has its pros and cons, which we get to learn about in great detail as the story switches between flash backs to the past – in which we become privy to how the Riva siblings grew up – and hourly updates throughout the day and night of the party and all the drama it brings. I could see some people finding this constant switching to be choppy, but I thought it flowed well. This is a very character driven story – something you may want to keep in mind if that’s not generally your cup of tea. All four of the Riva siblings were compelling, but Nina stole the show for me. Her arc is amazing. I was clapping at one point and my dogs were really confused. During the party scenes, we get perspectives of other random side characters. They didn’t serve much purpose other than to show how the party gets so out of hand. But it tells you right in the summary that the house ends up in flames by the morning, and I was so enraptured with the Riva siblings that I totally forgot until it suddenly was. Malibu Rising is another great addition to the universe TJR is creating. If you’re thinking of trying out a TJR book, you can’t go wrong here, but it's a more satisfying read if you have previous knowledge of The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo (2017) and/or Daisy Jones & the Six (2019) as Mick Riva makes an appearance in both of those books, and we see characters from those stories here. (view spoiler)[Thus, I knew how Mick’s characterization was going to be – and it was spot on – but I was still pissed as he was continuously an asshat. (hide spoiler)] A testament to Reid’s writing skills. "
2548,4.0,"This review can also be found at https://carolesrandomlife.com/I had a good time with this audiobook! I was really excited to get the chance to listen to a copy of this audiobook since I have heard so many good things about Taylor Jenkins Reid’s work. The fact that one of my favorite narrators, Julia Whelan, narrates this book was another point in this book’s favor. It didn’t take long before I started to understand why so many people seem to love this author.This book tells the story of the Riva family. Much of the book is set in 1983 at the Riva annual party which has become an event for the rich and famous in the area. Nina, a model, hosts the party and this year she is doing it without her tennis star husband since he left her. One of her brothers, Jay, who is a champion surfer has a big secret that will change his life. Another brother, Hud, has been keeping something big from Jay that could drive a wedge between them. The baby of the family, Kit, is trying to figure out some things about herself and is keeping a few things to herself as well.We also get to see the history of this family in the sections of the book that were set in the past. We get to know June and see how she fell in love with Mick Riva. June put up with a lot and had more than her fair share of challenges in her life. She did the best she could but often wasn’t everything her kids needed her to be. Eventually, everything falls on Nina’s shoulders and I was in awe of everything she sacrificed for her siblings.I really grew to like this cast of characters over the course of this story. I loved that we had the chance to see things from each of the key players’ point of view. I really liked the way that we slowly learn this families history as we see them prepare for their massive party. It was great to see the siblings come together and be the support system for each other that they needed. I thought that the descriptions of the party were very well done and I was mad at the people in attendance on behalf of the Rivas.Julia Whelan did a phenomenal job with the narration. There is a rather large cast of characters and I loved the way that she used a distinctive voice for each of them. She added a lot of emotion to the story through her reading. I wanted to listen to this book for hours at a time and I believe that her narration added to my overall enjoyment.I would recommend this book to others. I thought that this was a very well done story about a family who has managed to overcome every challenge that has been thrown at them. I will definitely be reading more of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s work in the future.I received a copy of this audiobook from Penguin Random House Audio Publishing Group via Libro.fm.Initial ThoughtsThis was really good! This was the first time that I have read, or listened to, any of Taylor Jenkins Reid's work and I now understand why she has so many fans. I was taken by this family who has had to deal with more than their fair share of challenges. Julia Whelan did a fantastic job with the narration. "
2549,5.0,"*Thank you to Netgalley for the ARC. All opinions are my own* I absolutely loved this. This story is full of heartbreaking, heartwarming and reflective moments. The sibling relationships were the highlight for me and I’m so glad we got to see all of their perspectives. TJR has such beautiful writing which is present in all of her books however, this was the book that made me absolutely love it. I love this book more than Evelyn and Daisy which I didn’t think was possible but here we are. I especially appreciate the characters’ love for the ocean. I’ve never been able to express my love for the ocean into words but TJR has done it for me and I will forever love that. Just a minor thing that might bother other people but it didn’t bother me (clearly) is that if you’re going into this book thinking that the Malibu Fire is a focal point in the plot, it’s not. Again I didn’t care as much because I was just invested in the characters and the writing. If you did love Evelyn and Daisy then you will obviously love this too but if you haven’t, I think this is a good starting point."
2550,4.0,"(⭐4.5)En definitiva deben leer si o si los libros de Taylor Jenkins Reid, es increíble cómo logra dar vida a sus personajes y meterte de lleno en cada historia. Así me sucedió con Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo y ahora con Malibú Renace.La historia de los hermanos Riva es preciosa, sus vidas están llenas de momentos verdaderamente difíciles y otros más de bellos recuerdos, y si bien el libro hace referencia a la fiesta anual de los Riva y lo que transcurre en apenas 24 horas, tenemos capítulos que nos transportan al pasado donde conocemos a su padre Mick Riva, cómo se inició en el mundo de la música y cómo 'formó' una familia, es a partir de entonces donde descubrimos la infancia de Nina, Jay, Hud y Kit y lo que hicieron para salir adelante, completamente solos y con un fin sin de adversidades. Y la verdad es que Nina se queda como mi personaje favorito de este libro, por su fortaleza como mujer, por su dedicación y su entrega. Y sin reparo alguno, mi odio completo es para Mick Riva.Sin embargo, el desarrollo de la fiesta y el incendio posterior de la casa de Nina, sería para mí esa parte del libro en la que mayor expectativas tenía y que no fue lo que esperaba, claro, sin dejar de ser algo bueno y atractivo, sobre todo por la gama de personajes que aparecen: actores, actrices, directores de cine, deportistas, estrellas de la música, modelos y el descontrol que provocan todos en conjunto.En sí, se trata de un libro muy emotivo y triste, con pinceladas de alegría por momentos, porque si algo tiene Taylor Jenkins Ried es crear ambientes que te hacen sentir mil emociones al mismo tiempo.¡Por favor léanlo!"
2551,5.0,"Mi problema con Taylor Jenkins es que cada que termino de leer sus libros nunca sé cuánto darle así que automáticamente se llevan las 5 estrellas. Sería repetitivo decir que sus personajes, para mí, se sienten tan reales que solo quiero buscar más sobre ellos en internet.Este en específico me tocó mucho. Se sintió más cercano. Una novela de chisme y aún así tan familiar, tan caluroso, tierno e incluso doloroso.Los quiero. Quiero mucho a Nina, Jay, Hud, Kit y June. Me dolieron y aún así los amé. ¿Mick Riva? ¿Quién es ese? AAAAHHH hasta en el mero final no logré soportarlo. ¿Cómo se puede ser tan idiota? Enserio, eh."
2552,5.0,“He had one of those hearts that stick to things. And he wanted to stick to her. She seemed like like a such a good one to stick to” What I love about TJR’s writing is that she makes such interesting main AND side characters!! I love how they all connect with one another and bring the story together so perfectly. No one gets left behind and im so eager to see what each character is doing and how they move the plot. And of course the writing style is just so phenomenal I truly don’t know how she does it!!! I adored the Riva’s sibilings relationship and how much they truly loved and cared for one another no matter what!
2553,5.0,"I knew from the beginning I would love this book, but I didn't expect for me to actually be this emersed into the story.RTC."
2554,5.0,"One of my new favorite books. Probably my favorite out of the three in this universe so far. Let’s just give some praise to Taylor Jenkins Reid for a minute because she does it once again with Malibu Rising. TJR has a way of writing books that suck you in and keep you hooked to the point where I literally stayed up until 2:30 AM to finish this book because I could not put it down. It felt like I was in Malibu, living alongside the Riva siblings, Mick, and June. I mean it’s genuinely hard to believe that these characters aren’t real people because it all feels so real. I can’t tell you how much I love the Riva siblings. Nina especially (like I genuinely cannot put it into words so just know that I loved their characters so much). I also cannot tell you how much I hated Mick Riva. It’s hard for my brain to understand how one person can be so heartless as to leave four children, COME BACK, and then leave them AGAIN without so much as a birthday card or an ounce of remorse. I definitely had lower expectations for this book than I did with Daisy Jones and The Six or The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo because what interesting things could you really write about a group of siblings, but I was soo wrong. The story of the Riva siblings and June is such a heartbreaking one yet so inspiring. It’s intricate, complicated, and definitely not perfect but it is beautiful. TL;DR:Yes I love this book go read it now. Bye. —————————OMFG THAT WAS SO GOOD. Official review coming soon but for now enjoy this haiku:Mick’s a fucking prick.I hate Mick and you should too.Stan the Riva kids. *pls give me a break it’s like 2:30am rn"
2555,4.0,"Malibu Rising by Taylor Jenkins Reid is yet another great read featuring California celebs of the 80s and before. With several nods to Seven Husband's of Evelyn Hugo, Malibu Rising imbues scandal, celebrity and fame. Mick Riva, one of Evelyn's seven husbands, is a father. Malibu Rising is all about the Mick Riva family, specifically, the siblings and how they navigate a life in the shadows of their famous father. I absolutely loved the first half of this book and I loved how the book concluded. However, most of part two had me all kinds of discombobulated and over stimulated for what felt like sheer absurdity for nothing but shock factor. The first half of this book is about the Riva family's past and ""present,"" which is the 80s. The second half of this story is in the ""present"" featuring the Riva party of the century. This party was so extra it felt unreal. There were characters spilling out of every corner of the pages that had little to do with the narrative and some of the things that happened at this party were simply insane. Totally chaotic and unbelievable. But after the party ends, the book concludes in what I thought was a very satisfactory fashion. I was happy with it! One thing I really, really loved was the portrayal of the sibling relationships and solid character development as they grew up. There were some truly tender moments that add real heart to the story. Daisy Jones and Evelyn Hugo are still my five star favorites of TJR but Malibu Rising is a solid novel as well. Thank you, NetGalley, Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine, and TJR, for a copy of this book for review! "
2556,4.0,"So... This took me so long to write a review for becuase I was waiting to feel differently. I love Taylor Jenkins Reid. She is an author who can write a list of reasons she hates me personally and I would preorder it. I love her writing and her ability to craft such full characters within rich universes. I had high hopes for this book - TJR does 80s Malibu? Yes PLEASE. But...I wouldn't say I was disappointed in the book itself - I overhyped it in my own head - I just wanted something more. As per usual, I fell in love with the characters, and all their imperfections. But usually what I see from TJR is characters that are generally good people who sometimes make mistakes and who try to right their wrongs. That's what I've come to expect, so when there were characters here that I wanted to k word, I was let down. But I get it, not every character has to be good in the end. As for the story itself, I was captivated by it. It started slow but that's not a bad thing. My only qualm was that I sort of could see where it was going very early on and it did not surprise me.. at all. That and there were so many characters being introduced constantly. I think I get why though, to sort of induce the feeling of things getting out of hand? So while at first it threw me off - I can't name half the people in this book - I ended up enjoying this about it. It still gets 4 stars from me, because TJR! But It's not a favourite of mine and I'd recommend Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones as they are better character studies with a more vivid setting, in my opinion. "
2557,4.0,"3.5 stars.It was NOT a romance. It was women’s fiction similar to Daisy Jones & The Six. This was a story about a family and how parents choices affected the kids etc The writing was suspenseful, detailed and well developed. It spanned flash backed from Nina and her siblings to her mom June and her dad."
2558,5.0,"Perfect summer beach read! This is my 3rd TJR book. I loved Daisy & Evelyn Hugo so of course I was so pumped for Malibu Rising and had high expectations and it did not disappoint! I was sucked in from the beginning and read the entire book in a day. The Malibu setting was both fun and refreshing. I loved the dysfunctional Riva children and their strong bond. Ninas selfless character was my favorite and I loved seeing her personal growth from the beginning to the end of the book. I enjoyed how the book went from the 1960s time frame of the past with Mick & June to the current time frame in the 80s with the grown children. I would have loved an epilogue for a few years later on included. Overall, a super enjoyable read! Review posted to Goodreads and will be posting on Amazon on the publication date. Thank you Net Galley and Random House for this ARC!"
2559,4.0,3.5 Stars for Malibu Rising (audiobook) by Taylor Jenkins Reid read by Julia Whelan.  I think the story is interesting. I just wish I could like the characters more but then I’m sure it would be less authentic. The narration was good. The narrator’s voices helped me keep track of all of the different characters. 
2560,4.0,"TJR has her magic. But Malibu can't be Evelyn or Daisy and it shouldn't be(although similar, the characters are way too different). It's a good book but just not a 5.However, I'll continue to read TJR's books the very week they are released."
2562,4.0,"Malibu Rising was one of my most anticipated releases of 2021 and even though the book didn’t exactly disappoint me, it still wasn’t good enough for me to rate it five stars. I’m a huge fan of Taylor Jenkins Reid’s style of writing and once again really enjoyed the writing in this novel. It was also a really quick read and I never felt bored with the story. Nevertheless, something bothered me about Malibu Rising but I can’t put my finger on what exactly it is. There was just this tiny part of me that thought “Wait, that’s it?” once I’d finished the book. instagram || my blog || twitter  "
2563,5.0,"so its official Taylor Jenkins Reid is my favourite author. I love her writing style, the characters and just the all round vibes. This is the prefect summer read fully of drama and beach vibes "
2564,5.0,"J'ai adoré. Dès les premières pages, j'étais accro et incapable de m'arrêter de lire : on s'attache aux personnages, à leurs liens, à leurs histoires... c'est magnifiquement écrit et mené d'une main de maitre, vraiment un beau coup de coeur qui m'a encore été offert par Taylor Jenkins Reid."
2565,4.0,"Nina, tienes todo mi corazón ❤"
2566,1.0,"I finished this book more than twenty-four hours ago, and I have not touched another book since. That is a testament to how much I hated this, because I love to read. It's one of my favourite hobbies. I don't know why I am trying to convince people of this on my Goodreads account, but I'm sure you get the point. Malibu Rising was such trite, cliched, and tedious storytelling that it has put me off reading in general. Which is a shame, really, because it was one of my most anticipated reads of the month. I loved The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones and the Six—so much so that I've read both of those novels twice. But this was an unparalleled disaster, earning the dubious honour of my least favourite novel of 2021. And I've read 125 novels in 2021.There were many things I hated about this novel, so many that I may not be able to fit them all into one review. First, there were a ridiculous number of grammar errors for a published work. I have at least five different highlighted comments where I complain about comma splices, and that's just for the sentences I bothered to correct. I can overlook a few typos or mistakes, but not consistent grammar mistakes that a high schooler can catch. Second, the characters are bland and dull. I was told about every single annoying character that pops up in this novel instead of experiencing their personalities. Instead of seeing characters in situations that highlight aspects of who they are, I was bashed over the head with adjectives and soppy praise from other members of the cast. I hate rich people and I hate surfing as a concept—why did I think I'd like this book? What, exactly, was I supposed to gain from reading 300+ pages about these dull and annoying characters? I can enjoy morally grey or actively awful people. I cannot excuse a badly written character.Third, this book is boring. There is no plot to speak of. There are no real messages to speak of. Wait, I forgot: girls, if you grow up in poverty, eventually you will be scouted by a rich man who wants you to sexualize yourself for a camera so the two of you can profit off your talent and your father's name. And one day, your father will come to your irresponsible and idiotic house party so you can tell him off. Way to go! Such great storytelling! Was I supposed to care about any of it? There is so much forced and idiotic melodrama that I wanted to bash my head through a wall. I am all for soap opera plots, but force a soap opera plot on uninteresting characters buoyed by a string of stupid coincidences and I am out.Fourth, the romance in this book is extremely unappetizing. The only character I came remotely close to sympathizing with was June, and she is remorselessly punished by the narrative for the entirety of her page time. She is forced into an unhealthy relationship with a significantly older man who she never gets over. There is nothing compelling about this relationship except the disgusting power dynamic, and there is no real commentary on how morally repugnant it is. The book doesn't even seem to acknowledge how horrible the situation is and how it reeks of misogyny. Every other romance is so unexciting and wearisome that I won't bother commenting.In conclusion, this was the worst disappointment of my life, and I saw Avengers: Endgame in theatres. Do not waste your valuable time and money on this poor excuse for a novel. Have a great day, everyone, and pick something else to read."
2567,5.0,Absolutely STUNNING. Probably my new favorite TJR book. Okay - more thoughts to come I promise.

“Throughout it all, this grace had always saved her.”
— Thank you to Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine Books for providing an ARC via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Another astonishing work by Taylor Jenkins Reid, the focus on family and its meaningful themes were beautifully done and hard hitting emotionally. Malibu Rising centers around the Riva siblings, children of Mick Riva (who had his own chapter in Evelyn Hugo!), each of their individual lives and how it all spiraled in the span of twenty-four hours. Nina and Kit Riva were my favorites by the end. I related the most to Kit and adored her fiery spirit as well as her process of figuring herself out and who she wants to be. Nina on the other hand, her full story was the most devastating, the way she feels obligated to carry so much on her shoulders after everything that’s happened to her family but also admired how much truly she cares for her loved ones to a huge extent. It was Nina’s overall character arc that genuinely breathtaking and intriguing to see from beginning to end especially the development of her inner thoughts and mindset on life. 
“Capable is a question I never had the luxury of asking. Because my family needed me. And unlike you, I understand how important that is.”
I enjoyed Jay and Hud’s arcs and their close brother bond as well but personally did not resonate with them on the emotional sense as I did with Nina and Kit. I did wish the second half of the book still focused around the siblings instead of veering off a bit all over the place with numerous different perspectives changing every few pages with the people who were at the party. I guess it did add a bit of that flair, interesting drama, and comedy to the story, but it felt detached lacking that depth that the first half of the book had with telling each of the siblings’ stories, feelings, their childhoods and along with their parents’ backstories. It was part one and about the last 5 percent of the book that really hit and had me a sobbing mess with the stunning dialogue between the siblings and the completion of character arcs. Overall, I loved this book truly and reading a book set in Socal was captivating to me. Fans of TJR will find Malibu Rising a quite satisfying and of course, heart shattering and healing read!“They had taught her that family is found, that whether it be blood or circumstance or choice, what binds us does not matter. All that matters is that we are bound.”“Maybe our parents' lives are imprinted within us, maybe the only fate there is the temptation of reliving their mistakes. Maybe, try as we might, we will never be able to outrun the blood that runs through our veins.”"
2569,5.0,"THE GOOD:* can i just... scream?* every time I pick up a Taylor Jenkins Reid book, I’m all naive and confident that I won’t cry* howeVER ahahahahaha *sobs** no author I’ve read has quite the ability to 1. make me believe fictional people are read and 2. make me sad i don’t know them* this was heartbreaking and hopeful and anger-inducing and warm and gut-punching and raw, all at the same time* Taylor Jenkins Reid can walk all over me and I’d say thank you * i just LOVED THIS SO MUCH* this was a book about family and choices and selfishness and acceptance and the idea that no matter how much we try to escape our past, sometimes we’re doomed to make the same mistakes as our parents* but sometimes we do better and we grow up as better people, despite everything going against us* listen, i’m emotional thank you* i just.... lsgflsasdadafdafsd pls read thisTHE BAD:* there are A LOT of characters to follow - not only the main cast, but snippets of other characters, and destinies, that are interwoven with the main story, so that can get confusing (it did not bother me, though, because it worked out amazing)* there’s a time jump between the past and the present and some people might be annoyed by thatYAY or NAY: lmao are we even having this debateFavourite quotes:“How were you supposed to change- in ways both big and small- when your family was always there to remind you of exactly the person you apparently signed an ironclad contract to be?”“Just because it is in Malibu's nature to burn, so was it in one particular person's nature to set fire and walk away.”★★★★★"
2570,3.0,"TJR is an auto-buy author for me. Evelyn Hugo and Daisy Jones are two of my favorite characters of all time. I was caught up in their lives and the authenticity of the writing made me almost believe they were real. The supporting characters in both of those novels were icing on the cake!My NetGalley request for Malibu Rising is still in pending purgatory but I lucked out I was first on the waiting list at the library when it was published.But... *stage whisper* I didn't love it.It's August 1983 and model Nina Riva is preparing for her annual end of summer party that has become the stuff of legend. Everyone who knows her address is invited --- all of Malibu as well as the biggest stars in Hollywood are expected. Little does Nina or her three siblings know that tonight is going to be a reckoning for their family as they confront the past and make life-changing decisions and the party will end with multiple arrests, a car crash, and a mansion in flames.Malibu Rising gives readers the love story of singer Mick Riva and his first wife June and follows the lives of their four children: surfer/supermodel Nina, champion surfer Jay, photographer Hud, and up-and-coming surfer/kid sister Kit. Chapters are divided into the hours leading up to the party to build anticipation. Each Riva sibling is struggling with the past and has a secret in the present that is slowly revealed over the course of the day.As the party begins, the stakes are raised with appearances from celebrities, a cheating spouse --- and their jilted lover, an estranged father, and a possible sibling no one knew about.The story felt like one of those 80s party movies where I was supposed to get caught up in the drama and debauchery as everything begins to spin out of control... but I just didn't feel the immediacy of the events or feel like I truly got to know any of the Riva siblings. There were so many random scenes that introduce us briefly to a character that has nothing to do with the overall story just to show how the party is unfolding and while this could've been fun, it didn't work for me here.Malibu Rising was still a well-developed story with a tragic romance, a struggling family, and a wild party but I didn't connect with it on the same level as previous Reid novels; the characters just didn't come to life for me here.For more reviews, visit www.rootsandreads.wordpress.com"
2571,2.0,"Once again, I find myself stuck in the minority category. BIG EYE-ROLL – like this is going to be a big surprise to some of you. Malibu Rising reminds me a little of those old racy page-turners set in Hollywood that were written by once-upon-a-time-best-selling romance author Jackie Collins. And if you’ve read one, you’ve read them all.Readers are introduced to the Riva family when Mick meets June in 1956. Fast forward to 1983 – four kids later – Mick has flown the coop years ago, become a famous singer and divorced June, marries and divorces wife number two, comes back to June to make amends and impregnates her before taking off again. He marries four or maybe five more times (I’ve lost count at this point) – and June is still running her family’s diner, left to raise the kids (sort of), and holding out hope that Mick will return to her. She’s also turned to alcohol for comfort leaving the kids to fend for themselves. Seeing how things ended up, thankfully the Riva offspring were a strong lot for the most part and managed to get themselves raised. I might be rambling a bit, but at this point it’s hard not to, and hopefully you’ll get the point of my doing so. Actually, it took some real grit to make myself finish this ugly mess. And no good feelings or even a satisfying ending to be found. A lot of walk-on characters who make an entrance and disappear into the vapors of weed, lines of cocaine, drunken stupors, hot-tubs and romps in beds that don’t belong to them. What’s up with so many insignificant page-filling one-timers? Weren’t there enough screwed-up main characters to keep this craziness afloat? Underdeveloped guilty pleasure that was a bit too soap opera-ish. And the hint of a fiery ending was barely a spark before it died a slow death along with the rest of the story. Everyone scattered in the wind with no finality, and I’m not very fond of writing my own endings for someone else’s story.  I gave it a 2-star review for the effort and potential there was -- if only the author had taken another route. But my biggest disappointment lies in the fact that I know Reid has written much better – far better. Here lies only glitz and glam and no substance (well there’s plenty of substance -- abuse). Too bad and so sad! "
2572,3.0,"Bueno. Me ha decepcionado.En resumen, Malibu Rising promete contar dos historias: a) una relativa a la descendencia de Mick Riva, ícono de la música; y b) la historia de un incendio. Este último punto pareciera, nada más empezar, ser lo más importante. No sólo por la destrucción asociada a un incendio, sino que también porque, en teoría, después de un incendio, las personas vuelven a construir. De las cenizas renace el fénix, o algo parecido. Creo que esto es spoiler, pero en resumen, no es así como se dan las cosas. (view spoiler)[ Nos prometen una historia que va a ir in crescendo, cuyo punto cúlmine va a ser este incendio, que nos adelantan en el primer capítulo. Yo, por lo menos, me hacía la idea de que la escena del incendio sería tremendamente dramática y desgarradora. Que dejaría al lector con el corazón destrozado. Y pues eso no pasa. El incendio es casi como: ups, ahora la casa se quemo. Bueno, será. Igual nunca me gustó.  (hide spoiler)]Respecto de la vida de los hijos de Mick Riva, debo decir que me gustó bastante, tanto en cuanto a personajes como a la historia misma. Lo que sí siento es que le faltó un poco de profundidad, le faltó ahondar en los personajes, en por qué hacían lo que hacían.Y claro, podrían contestarme que es un tema de extensión: obvio que tomaría demasiadas páginas llegar a perfilar de esa manera a cuatro o cinco personajes (según si incluyamos a June, la madre de los hermanos Riva, o no). Y sí, es válido. Pero el argumento se agota un poco si tenemos a la vista la cantidad de capítulos de personajes absolutamente innecesarios (como Tarine, Ricky, Vanessa, y todos estos imbéciles que dejaron la grande en la casa de Nina).Así que, en resumen, no es que la historia sea mala o aburrida. No es así. Simplemente, me quedé con gusto a poco. No sé. Quizás es que me esperaba una historia épica, con protagonistas únicos (como en Los siete maridos de Evelyn Hugo). Es que además tenía el potencial de serlo. Pero, en su lugar, siento que el libro es mediocre, y me quedo más bien con lo que podría haber sido."
2573,5.0,"TJR can do no wrong in my opinion, and her streak continues with Malibu Rising. It's Malibu in the 80s and Nina Riva, a famous model, throws her annual party of the year with her 3 siblings. Over the course of a day, secrets are bared, love is declared and hearts are broken. With flashbacks to the 1950s, this is a fantastic story about family and the wonderful relationship between siblings.There are numerous characters including the four siblings, the parents, one set of grandparents and supporting characters. Woah! A lot right? Well TJR is amazing with character development and I felt connected to all the main characters, I felt like I knew them so well. I am already waiting on pins and needles for her next book. A special thank you to NetGalley and Libro FM for my ALC, it was absolutely incredible in audio"
2574,5.0,"I think it is going to be a little difficult for me to review this book without just gushing incoherently about all the things I loved about it, but here goes nothing. This had all of my favorite things that I have come to expect from Taylor Jenkins Reid and so much more! First of all, I am always a sucker for a book that follows an untraditional format or timeline and it was so interesting to be flipping back and forth through time. Where this book shines for me is the dynamic between all the siblings. They all felt so loyal and tied together while still having their own characteristics and unique struggles. Nina's pragmatism juxtaposed with Kit's sass made for hilarious interactions that made me laugh out loud. Jay and Hud's complex bond tugged at my heartstrings and made me care so much about the problems between them. I also loved getting to see the small glimpses into the other party-goers lives and I think that structure would lend itself very well to a movie format. It's no secret that I love Daisy Jones and the Six, but I think this one may have topped it. I cannot wait to listen to the audiobook for this one and reread it over and over!! ARC provided to me through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review ***brb gotta go cry and think about this one. this book was so all consuming, i can’t wait to read it again. rtc!"
2575,4.0,"Book 169 of 20214.5 ✨Many thanks to Libro FM and Penguin Audio for my ALC. Taylor Jenkins Reid wowwwwwwLook, I've been scared to read another TJR book since Evelyn Hugo because I loved that book so much and I didn't want to be ever let down by the author. Sounds crazy but it is what it is.When I got this one from Libro FM as a June ALC, I was torn on reading it but @lipglossmaffia rated it highly and I was spurred to go ahead. Bruh. I'm so glad I did. This book was so well done.Historical fiction, set in Malibu/LA, multi generational, unfolds within 24 hours and at the same time there are time jumps to the past and a masterful use of flashbacks??? Yes please.There are so many elements at play here, and so many characters too, and a host of different timelines to work with. One would think it would get overwhelming at some point but it never did. TJR showed her expertise through and through.I want to wrap Nina in a hug. She's my favorite character in this book and I love her so much. I could relate to her so much and wow. She was just such a perfectly written character. Her siblings were amazing as well.I can't believe the nerve of men like Mick and Brandon, that's all I'll say without giving too much away.I loved this book so much and Julia Whelan was amazing with the audiobook narration!I highly recommend it!"
2576,5.0,"STUNNING. 💕This was my first TJR book and I’m so very happy I picked it up. Most people reviewing this book are saying it’s their least favorite of hers and they were a little disappointed. If that’s the case then I’m in for a much bigger world of hurt when I get to her other books. I ADORED this story. An only child, I can never really relate to the whole sibling connection in books, but the Riva siblings? My god, I loved them. I felt for them and cared about them like they were real. I was invested in them and had to know that they were going to be alright in the end. I found myself taking my sweet time, absorbing the two timelines and re-reading passages, because Reid’s voice captivated me and held me. Such beautiful and honest writing. For the first time in my life, I tabbed paragraphs that I loved. I don’t recall a book pulling on my heartstrings and making me tear up when it was finished, as this one did. You don’t have to have lived in California, you don’t have to know anything about surfing, and I promise, you don’t have to have come from a big family to appreciate the message in this book. And, if you happen to be an empath, well, hold on tight. 😉Thank you, Taylor Jenkins Reid, for writing this beautiful story. "
2577,5.0,"This book was a great mix between a cozy beach read and a family's struggle to survive. Taylor Jenkins Reid has the ability to set an atmosphere and make the reader feel like a part of the scenery. At first I thought that the novel taking place over the course of just one day wouldn't be enough to dive deep into the lives of the four children of Mick Riva and get to fully know them but I was wrong. Many illuminating flashbacks to romantic moments, marriages, betrayals, births and deaths were interspersed throughout their daily lives.The dramatic events and the 80s vibe were very well balanced. All the characters were well formed and very complex. They all grew up thanks to their unbreakable bond, appreciation and respect for one another. I personally loved the way the ocean and surfing were portrayed as these two beacons of salvation for the brothers and sisters. By the end of the book we are reminded that “it is Malibu’s nature to burn” and despite all the struggles and losses it would also bring renewal, rising from the ashes."
